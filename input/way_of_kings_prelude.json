      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\nPRELUDE TOTHE STORMLIGHT ARCHIVE\r\nKalak rounded a rocky stone ridge and stumbled to a stop before the body of a dying thunderclast. The enormous stone beast lay on its side, riblike protrusions from its chest broken and cracked. The monstrosity was vaguely skeletal in shape, with unnaturally long limbs that sprouted from granite shoulders. The eyes were deep red spots on the arrowhead face, as if created by a fire burning deep within the stone. They faded.\r\nEven after all these centuries, seeing a thunderclast up close made Kalak shiver. The beast\u2019s hand was as long as a man was tall. He\u2019d been killed by hands like those before, and it hadn\u2019t been pleasant.\r\nOf course, dying rarely was.\r\nHe rounded the creature, picking his way more carefully across the battlefield. The plain was a place of misshapen rock and stone, natural pillars rising around him, bodies littering the ground. Few plants lived here.\r\nThe stone ridges and mounds bore numerous scars. Some were shattered, blasted-out sections where Surgebinders had fought. Less frequently, he passed cracked, oddly shaped hollows where thunderclasts had ripped themselves free of the stone to join the fray.\r\nMany of the bodies around him were human; many were not. Blood mixed. Red. Orange. Violet. Though none of the bodies around him stirred, an indistinct haze of sounds hung in the air. Moans of pain, cries of grief. They did not seem like the sounds of victory. Smoke curled from the occasional patches of growth or heaps of burning corpses. Even some sections of rock smoldered. The Dustbringers had done their work well.\r\nBut I survived,Kalak thought, hand to breast as he hastened to the meeting place.\r\nI actually survived this time.\r\nThat was dangerous. When he died, he was sent back, no choice. When he survived the Desolation, he was supposed to go back as well. Back to that place that he dreaded. Back to that place of pain and fire. What if he just decided\u2026not to go?\r\nPerilous thoughts, perhaps traitorous thoughts. He hastened on his way.\r\nThe place of meeting was in the shadow of a large rock formation, a spire rising into the sky. As always, the ten of them had decided upon it before the battle. The survivors would make their way here. Oddly, only one of the others was waiting for him. Jezrien. Had the other eight all died? It was possible. The battle had been so furious this time, one of the worst. The enemy was growing increasingly tenacious.\r\nBut no. Kalak frowned as he stepped up to the base of the spire. Seven magnificent swords stood proudly here, driven point-first into the stone ground. Each was a masterly work of art, flowing in design, inscribed with glyphs and patterns. He recognized each one. If their masters had died, the Blades would have vanished.\r\nThese Blades were weapons of power beyond even Shardblades. These were unique. Precious. Jezrien stood outside the ring of swords, looking eastward.\r\n\u201CJezrien?\u201D\r\nThe figure in white and blue glanced toward him. Even after all these centuries, Jezrien looked young, like a man barely into his thirtieth year. His short black beard was neatly trimmed, though his once-fine clothing was scorched and stained with blood. He folded his arms behind his back as he turned to Kalak.\r\n\u201CWhat is this, Jezrien?\u201D Kalak asked. \u201CWhere are the others?\u201D\r\n\u201CDeparted.\u201D Jezrien\u2019s voice was calm, deep, regal. Though he hadn\u2019t worn a crown in centuries, his royal manner lingered. He always seemed to know what to do. \u201CYou might call it a miracle. Only one of us died this time.\u201D\r\n\u201CTalenel,\u201D Kalak said. His was the only Blade unaccounted for.\r\n\u201CYes. He died holding that passage by the northern waterway.\u201D\r\nKalak nodded. Taln had a tendency to choose seemingly hopeless fights and win them. He also had a tendency to die in the process. He would be back now, in the place where they went between Desolations. The place of nightmares.\r\nKalak found himself shaking. When had he become so weak? \u201CJezrien, I can\u2019t return this time.\u201D Kalak whispered the words, stepping up and gripping the other man\u2019s arm. \u201CI\r\ncan\u2019t.\u201D\r\nKalak felt something within him break at the admission. How long had it been? Centuries, perhaps millennia, of torture. It was so hard to keep track. Those fires, those hooks, digging into his flesh anew each day. Searing the skin off his arm, then burning the fat, then driving to the bone. He could smell it. Almighty, he could\r\nsmellit!\r\n\u201CLeave your sword,\u201D Jezrien said.\r\n\u201CWhat?\u201D\r\nJezrien nodded to the ring of weapons. \u201CI was chosen to wait for you. We weren\u2019t certain if you had survived. A\u2026a decision has been made. It is time for the Oathpact to end.\u201D\r\nKalak felt a sharp stab of horror. \u201CWhat will that do?\u201D\r\n\u201CIshar believes that so long as there is one of us still bound to the Oathpact, it may be enough. There is a chance we might end the cycle of Desolations.\u201D\r\nKalak looked into the immortal king\u2019s eyes. Black smoke rose from a small patch to their left. Groans of the dying haunted them from behind. There, in Jezrien\u2019s eyes, Kalak saw anguish and grief. Perhaps even cowardice. This was a man hanging from a cliff by a thread.\r\nAlmighty above,Kalak thought.\r\nYou\u2019re broken too, aren\u2019t you?They all were.\r\nKalak turned and walked to the side, where a low ridge overlooked part of the battlefield.\r\nThere were so many corpses, and among them walked the living. Men in primitive wraps, carrying spears topped by bronze heads. Juxtaposed between them were others in gleaming plate armor. One group walked past, four men in their ragged tanned skins or shoddy leather joining a powerful figure in beautiful silver plate, amazingly intricate. Such a contrast.\r\nJezrien stepped up beside him.\r\n\u201CThey see us as divinities,\u201D Kalak whispered. \u201CThey rely upon us, Jezrien. We\u2019re all that they have.\u201D\r\n\u201CThey have the Radiants. That will be enough.\u201D\r\nKalak shook his head. \u201CHe will not remain bound by this. The enemy. He will find a way around it. You know he will.\u201D\r\n\u201CPerhaps.\u201D The king of Heralds offered no further explanation.\r\n\u201CAnd Taln?\u201D Kalak asked.\r\nThe flesh burning. The fires. The pain over and over and over\u2026\r\n\u201CBetter that one man should suffer than ten,\u201D Jezrien whispered. He seemed so cold. Like a shadow caused by heat and light falling on someone honorable and true, casting this black imitation behind.\r\nJezrien walked back to the ring of swords. His own Blade formed in his hands, appearing from mist, wet with condensation. \u201CIt has been decided, Kalak. We will go our ways, and we will not seek out one another. Our Blades must be left. The Oathpact ends now.\u201D He lifted his sword and rammed it into the stone with the other seven.\r\nJezrien hesitated, looking at the sword, then bowed his head and turned away. As if ashamed. \u201CWe chose this burden willingly. Well, we can choose to drop it if we wish.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat do we tell the people, Jezrien?\u201D Kalak asked. \u201CWhat will they say of this day?\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s simple,\u201D Jezrien said, walking away. \u201CWe tell them that they finally won. It\u2019s an easy enough lie. Who knows? Maybe it will turn out to be true.\u201D\r\nKalak watched Jezrien depart across the burned landscape. Finally, he summoned his own Blade and slammed it into the stone beside the other eight. He turned and walked in the direction opposite from Jezrien.\r\nAnd yet, he could not help glancing back at the ring of swords and the single open spot. The place where the tenth sword should have gone.\r\nThe one of them who was lost. The one they had abandoned.\r\nForgive us,Kalak thought, then left."
