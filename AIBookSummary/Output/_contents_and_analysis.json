Frightened meant that deep, sickening feeling of something terrible about to happen. Frightened was the way he had felt a year ago when an unidentified aircraft had overflown the community twice. He had seen it both times. Squinting toward the sky, he had seen the sleek jet, almost a blur at its high speed, go past, and a second later heard the blast of sound that followed. Then one more time, a moment later, from the opposite direction, the same plane.\r\nAt first, he had been only fascinated. He had never seen aircraft so close, for it was against the rules for Pilots to fly over the community. Occasionally, when supplies were delivered by cargo planes to the landing field across the river, the children rode their bicycles to the riverbank and watched, intrigued, the unloading and then the takeoff directed to the west, always away from the community.\r\nBut the aircraft a year ago had been different. It was not a squat, fat-bellied cargo plane but a needle-nosed single-pilot jet. Jonas, looking around anxiously, had seen others\u2014adults as well as children\u2014stop what they were doing and wait, confused, for an explanation of the frightening event.\r\nThen all of the citizens had been ordered to go into the nearest building and stay there.\r\nIMMEDIATELY, the rasping voice through the speakers had said.\r\nLEAVE YOUR BICYCLES WHERE THEY ARE.\r\nInstantly, obediently, Jonas had dropped his bike on its side on the path behind his family\u2019s dwelling. He had run indoors and stayed there, alone. His parents were both at work, and his little sister, Lily, was at the Childcare Center where she spent her after-school hours.\r\nLooking through the front window, he had seen no people: none of the busy afternoon crew of Street Cleaners, Landscape Workers, and Food Delivery people who usually populated the community at that time of day. He saw only the abandoned bikes here and there on their sides; an upturned wheel on one was still revolving slowly.\r\nHe had been frightened then. The sense of his own community silent, waiting, had made his stomach churn. He had trembled.\r\nBut it had been nothing. Within minutes the speakers had crackled again, and the voice, reassuring now and less urgent, had explained that a Pilot-in-Training had misread his navigational instructions and made a wrong turn. Desperately the Pilot had been trying to make his way back before his error was noticed.\r\nNEEDLESS TO SAY, HE WILL BE RELEASED, the voice had said, followed by silence. There was an ironic tone to that final message, as if the Speaker found it amusing; and Jonas had smiled a little, though he knew what a grim statement it had been. For a contributing citizen to be released from the community was a final decision, a terrible punishment, an overwhelming statement of failure.\r\nEven the children were scolded if they used the term lightly at play, jeering at a teammate who missed a catch or stumbled in a race. Jonas had done it once, had shouted at his best friend, \u201CThat\u2019s it, Asher! You\u2019re released!\u201D when Asher\u2019s clumsy error had lost a match for his team. He had been taken aside for a brief and serious talk by the coach, had hung his head with guilt and embarrassment, and apologized to Asher after the game.\r\nNow, thinking about the feeling of fear as he pedaled home along the river path, he remembered that moment of palpable, stomach-sinking terror when the aircraft had streaked above. It was not what he was feeling now with December approaching. He searched for the right word to describe his own feeling.\r\nJonas was careful about language. Not like his friend, Asher, who talked too fast and mixed things up, scrambling words and phrases until they were barely recognizable and often very funny.\r\nJonas grinned, remembering the morning that Asher had dashed into the classroom, late as usual, arriving breathlessly in the middle of the chanting of the morning anthem. When the class took their seats at the conclusion of the patriotic hymn, Asher remained standing to make his public apology as was required.\r\n\u201CI apologize for inconveniencing my learning community.\u201D Asher ran through the standard apology phrase rapidly, still catching his breath. The Instructor and class waited patiently for his explanation. The students had all been grinning, because they had listened to Asher\u2019s explanations so many times before.\r\n\u201CI left home at the correct time but when I was riding along near the hatchery, the crew was separating some salmon. I guess I just got distraught, watching them.\r\n\u201CI apologize to my classmates,\u201D Asher concluded. He smoothed his rumpled tunic and sat down.\r\n\u201CWe accept your apology, Asher.\u201D The class recited the standard response in unison. Many of the students were biting their lips to keep from laughing.\r\n\u201CI accept your apology, Asher,\u201D the Instructor said. He was smiling. \u201CAnd I thank you, because once again you have provided an opportunity for a lesson in language. \u2018Distraught\u2019 is too strong an adjective to describe salmon-viewing.\u201D He turned and wrote \u201Cdistraught\u201D on the instructional board. Beside it he wrote \u201Cdistracted.\u201D\r\nJonas, nearing his home now, smiled at the recollection. Thinking, still, as he wheeled his bike into its narrow port beside the door, he realized that frightened was the wrong word to describe his feelings, now that December was almost here. It was too strong an adjective.\r\nHe had waited a long time for this special December. Now that it was almost upon him, he wasn\u2019t frightened, but he was .\u00A0.\u00A0. eager, he decided. He was eager for it to come. And he was excited, certainly. All of the Elevens were excited about the event that would be coming so soon.\r\nBut there was a little shudder of nervousness when he thought about it, about what might happen.\r\nApprehensive,Jonas decided. That\u2019s what I am.\r\n\u201CWho wants to be the first tonight, for feelings?\u201D Jonas\u2019s father asked, at the conclusion of their evening meal.\r\nIt was one of the rituals, the evening telling of feelings. Sometimes Jonas and his sister, Lily, argued over turns, over who would get to go first. Their parents, of course, were part of the ritual; they, too, told their feelings each evening. But like all parents\u2014all adults\u2014they didn\u2019t fight and wheedle for their turn.\r\nNor did Jonas, tonight. His feelings were too complicated this evening. He wanted to share them, but he wasn\u2019t eager to begin the process of sifting through his own complicated emotions, even with the help that he knew his parents could give.\r\n\u201CYou go, Lily,\u201D he said, seeing his sister, who was much younger\u2014only a Seven\u2014wiggling with impatience in her chair.\r\n\u201CI felt very angry this afternoon,\u201D Lily announced. \u201CMy Childcare group was at the play area, and we had a visiting group of Sevens, and they didn\u2019t obey the rules at\r\nall. One of them\u2014a male; I don\u2019t know his name\u2014kept going right to the front of the line for the slide, even though the rest of us were all waiting. I felt so angry at him. I made my hand into a fist, like this.\u201D She held up a clenched fist and the rest of the family smiled at her small defiant gesture.\r\n\u201CWhy do you think the visitors didn\u2019t obey the rules?\u201D Mother asked.\r\nLily considered, and shook her head. \u201CI don\u2019t know. They acted like .\u00A0.\u00A0. like .\u00A0.\u00A0.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnimals?\u201D Jonas suggested. He laughed.\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s right,\u201D Lily said, laughing too. \u201CLike animals.\u201D Neither child knew what the word meant, exactly, but it was often used to describe someone uneducated or clumsy, someone who didn\u2019t fit in.\r\n\u201CWhere were the visitors from?\u201D Father asked.\r\nLily frowned, trying to remember. \u201COur leader told us, when he made the welcome speech, but I can\u2019t remember. I guess I wasn\u2019t paying attention. It was from another community. They had to leave very early, and they had their midday meal on the bus.\u201D\r\nMother nodded. \u201CDo you think it\u2019s possible that their rules may be different? And so they simply didn\u2019t know what your play area rules were?\u201D\r\nLily shrugged, and nodded. \u201CI suppose.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou\u2019ve visited other communities, haven\u2019t you?\u201D Jonas asked. \u201CMy group has, often.\u201D\r\nLily nodded again. \u201CWhen we were Sixes, we went and shared a whole school day with a group of Sixes in their community.\u201D\r\n\u201CHow did you feel when you were there?\u201D\r\nLily frowned. \u201CI felt strange. Because their methods were different. They were learning usages that my group hadn\u2019t learned yet, so we felt stupid.\u201D\r\nFather was listening with interest. \u201CI\u2019m thinking, Lily,\u201D he said, \u201Cabout the boy who didn\u2019t obey the rules today. Do you think it\u2019s possible that he felt strange and stupid, being in a new place with rules that he didn\u2019t know about?\u201D\r\nLily pondered that. \u201CYes,\u201D she said, finally.\r\n\u201CI feel a little sorry for him,\u201D Jonas said, \u201Ceven though I don\u2019t even know him. I feel sorry for anyone who is in a place where he feels strange and stupid.\u201D\r\n\u201CHow do you feel now, Lily?\u201D Father asked. \u201CStill angry?\u201D\r\n\u201CI guess not,\u201D Lily decided. \u201CI guess I feel a little sorry for him. And sorry I made a fist.\u201D She grinned.\r\nJonas smiled back at his sister. Lily\u2019s feelings were always straightforward, fairly simple, usually easy to resolve. He guessed that his own had been, too, when he was a Seven.\r\nHe listened politely, though not very attentively, while his father took his turn, describing a feeling of worry that he\u2019d had that day at work: a concern about one of the newchildren who wasn\u2019t doing well. Jonas\u2019s father\u2019s title was Nurturer. He and the other Nurturers were responsible for all the physical and emotional needs of every newchild during its earliest life. It was a very important job, Jonas knew, but it wasn\u2019t one that interested him much.\r\n\u201CWhat gender is it?\u201D Lily asked.\r\n\u201CMale,\u201D Father said. \u201CHe\u2019s a sweet little male with a lovely disposition. But he isn\u2019t growing as fast as he should, and he doesn\u2019t sleep soundly. We have him in the extra care section for supplementary nurturing, but the committee\u2019s beginning to talk about releasing him.\u201D\r\n\u201COh,\r\nno,\u201D Mother murmured sympathetically. \u201CI know how sad that must make you feel.\u201D\r\nJonas and Lily both nodded sympathetically as well. Release of newchildren was always sad, because they hadn\u2019t had a chance to enjoy life within the community yet. And they hadn\u2019t done anything wrong.\r\nThere were only two occasions of release which were not punishment. Release of the elderly, which was a time of celebration for a life well and fully lived; and release of a newchild, which always brought a sense of what-could-we-have-done. This was especially troubling for the Nurturers, like Father, who felt they had failed somehow. But it happened very rarely.\r\n\u201CWell,\u201D Father said, \u201CI\u2019m going to keep trying. I may ask the committee for permission to bring him here at night, if you don\u2019t mind. You know what the night-crew Nurturers are like. I think this little guy needs something extra.\u201D\r\n\u201COf course,\u201D Mother said, and Jonas and Lily nodded. They had heard Father complain about the night crew before. It was a lesser job, night-crew nurturing, assigned to those who lacked the interest or skills or insight for the more vital jobs of the daytime hours. Most of the people on the night crew had not even been given spouses because they lacked, somehow, the essential capacity to connect to others, which was required for the creation of a family unit.\r\n\u201CMaybe we could even keep him,\u201D Lily suggested sweetly, trying to look innocent. The look was fake, Jonas knew; they all knew.\r\n\u201CLily,\u201D Mother reminded her, smiling, \u201Cyou know the rules.\u201D\r\nTwo children\u2014one male, one female\u2014to each family unit. It was written very clearly in the rules.\r\nLily giggled. \u201CWell,\u201D she said, \u201CI thought maybe just this once.\u201D\r\nNext, Mother, who held a prominent position at the Department of Justice, talked about her feelings. Today a repeat offender had been brought before her, someone who had broken the rules before. Someone who she hoped had been adequately and fairly punished, and who had been restored to his place: to his job, his home, his family unit. To see him brought before her a second time caused her overwhelming feelings of frustration and anger. And even guilt, that she hadn\u2019t made a difference in his life.\r\n\u201CI feel frightened, too, for him,\u201D she confessed. \u201CYou know that there\u2019s no third chance. The rules say that if there\u2019s a third transgression, he simply has to be released.\u201D Jonas shivered. He knew it happened. There was even a boy in his group of Elevens whose father had been released years before. No one ever mentioned it; the disgrace was unspeakable. It was hard to imagine.\r\nLily stood up and went to her mother. She stroked her mother\u2019s arm.\r\nFrom his place at the table, Father reached over and took her hand. Jonas reached for the other.\r\nOne by one, they comforted her. Soon she smiled, thanked them, and murmured that she felt soothed.\r\nThe ritual continued. \u201CJonas?\u201D Father asked. \u201CYou\u2019re last, tonight.\u201D\r\nJonas sighed. This evening he almost would have preferred to keep his feelings hidden. But it was, of course, against the rules.\r\n\u201CI\u2019m feeling apprehensive,\u201D he confessed, glad that the appropriate descriptive word had finally come to him.\r\n\u201CWhy is that, son?\u201D His father looked concerned.\r\n\u201CI know there\u2019s really nothing to worry about,\u201D Jonas explained, \u201Cand that every adult has been through it. I know you have, Father, and you too, Mother. But it\u2019s the Ceremony that I\u2019m apprehensive about. It\u2019s almost December.\u201D\r\nLily looked up, her eyes wide. \u201CThe Ceremony of Twelve,\u201D she whispered in an awed voice. Even the smallest children\u2014Lily\u2019s age and younger\u2014knew that it lay in the future for each of them.\r\n\u201CI\u2019m glad you told us of your feelings,\u201D Father said.\r\n\u201CLily,\u201D Mother said, beckoning to the little girl, \u201CGo on now and get into your nightclothes. Father and I are going to stay here and talk to Jonas for a while.\u201D\r\nLily sighed, but obediently she got down from her chair. \u201CPrivately?\u201D she asked.\r\nMother nodded. \u201CYes,\u201D she said, \u201Cthis talk will be a private one with Jonas.\u201D",

He waited.\r\n\u201CYou know,\u201D his father finally said, \u201Cevery December was exciting to me when I was young. And it has been for you and Lily, too, I\u2019m sure. Each December brings such changes.\u201D\r\nJonas nodded. He could remember the Decembers back to when he had become, well, probably a Four. The earlier ones were lost to him. But he observed them each year, and he remembered Lily\u2019s earliest Decembers. He remembered when his family received Lily, the day she was named, the day that she had become a One.\r\nThe Ceremony for the Ones was always noisy and fun. Each December, all the newchildren born in the previous year turned One. One at a time\u2014there were always fifty in each year\u2019s group, if none had been released\u2014they had been brought to the stage by the Nurturers who had cared for them since birth. Some were already walking, wobbly on their unsteady legs; others were no more than a few days old, wrapped in blankets, held by their Nurturers.\r\n\u201CI enjoy the Naming,\u201D Jonas said.\r\nHis mother agreed, smiling. \u201CThe year we got Lily, we knew, of course, that we\u2019d receive our female, because we\u2019d made our application and been approved. But I\u2019d been wondering and wondering what her name would be.\u201D\r\n\u201CI could have sneaked a look at the list prior to the ceremony,\u201D Father confided. \u201CThe committee always makes the list in advance, and it\u2019s right there in the office at the Nurturing Center.\r\n\u201CAs a matter of fact,\u201D he went on, \u201CI feel a little guilty about this. But I\r\ndidgo in this afternoon and looked to see if this year\u2019s Naming list had been made yet. It was right there in the office, and I looked up number Thirty-six\u2014that\u2019s the little guy I\u2019ve been concerned about\u2014because it occurred to me that it might enhance his nurturing if I could call him by a name. Just privately, of course, when no one else is around.\u201D\r\n\u201CDid you find it?\u201D Jonas asked. He was fascinated. It didn\u2019t seem a terribly important rule, but the fact that his father had broken a rule at all awed him. He glanced at his mother, the one responsible for adherence to the rules, and was relieved that she was smiling.\r\nHis father nodded. \u201CHis name\u2014if he makes it to the Naming without being released, of course\u2014is to be Gabriel. So I whisper that to him when I feed him every four hours, and during exercise and playtime. If no one can hear me.\r\n\u201CI call him Gabe, actually,\u201D he said, and grinned.\r\n\u201CGabe.\u201D Jonas tried it out. A good name, he decided.\r\nThough Jonas had only become a Five the year that they acquired Lily and learned her name, he remembered the excitement, the conversations at home, wondering about her: how she would look, who she would be, how she would fit into their established family unit. He remembered climbing the steps to the stage with his parents, his father by his side that year instead of with the Nurturers, since it was the year that he would be given a newchild of his own.\r\nHe remembered his mother taking the newchild, his sister, into her arms, while the document was read to the assembled family units. \u201CNewchild Twenty-three,\u201D the Namer had read. \u201CLily.\u201D\r\nHe remembered his father\u2019s look of delight, and that his father had whispered, \u201CShe\u2019s one of my favorites. I was hoping for her to be the one.\u201D The crowd had clapped, and Jonas had grinned. He liked his sister\u2019s name. Lily, barely awake, had waved her small fist. Then they had stepped down to make room for the next family unit.\r\n\u201CWhen I was an Eleven,\u201D his father said now, \u201Cas you are, Jonas, I was very impatient, waiting for the Ceremony of Twelve. It\u2019s a long two days. I remember that I enjoyed the Ones, as I always do, but that I didn\u2019t pay much attention to the other ceremonies, except for my sister\u2019s. She became a Nine that year, and got her bicycle. I\u2019d been teaching her to ride mine, even though technically I wasn\u2019t supposed to.\u201D\r\nJonas laughed. It was one of the few rules that was not taken very seriously and was almost\r\nalwaysbroken. The children all received their bicycles at Nine; they were not allowed to ride bicycles before then. But almost always, the older brothers and sisters had secretly taught the younger ones. Jonas had been thinking already about teaching Lily.\r\nThere was talk about changing the rule and giving the bicycles at an earlier age. A committee was studying the idea. When something went to a committee for study, the people always joked about it. They said that the committee members would become Elders by the time the rule change was made.\r\nRules were very hard to change. Sometimes, if it was a very important rule\u2014unlike the one governing the age for bicycles\u2014it would have to go, eventually, to The Receiver for a decision. The Receiver was the most important Elder. Jonas had never even seen him, that he knew of; someone in a position of such importance lived and worked alone. But the committee would never bother The Receiver with a question about bicycles; they would simply fret and argue about it themselves for years, until the citizens forgot that it had ever gone to them for study.\r\nHis father continued. \u201CSo I watched and cheered when my sister, Katya, became a Nine and removed her hair ribbons and got her bicycle,\u201D Father went on. \u201CThen I didn\u2019t pay much attention to the Tens and Elevens. And\r\nfinally,at the end of the second day, which seemed to go on forever, it was my turn. It was the Ceremony of Twelve.\u201D\r\nJonas shivered. He pictured his father, who must have been a shy and quiet boy, for he was a shy and quiet man, seated with his group, waiting to be called to the stage. The Ceremony of Twelve was the last of the Ceremonies. The most important.\r\n\u201CI remember how proud my parents looked\u2014and my sister, too; even though she wanted to be out riding the bicycle publicly, she stopped fidgeting and was very still and attentive when my turn came.\r\n\u201CBut to be honest, Jonas,\u201D his father said, \u201Cfor me there was not the element of suspense that there is with your Ceremony. Because I was already fairly certain of what my Assignment was to be.\u201D\r\nJonas was surprised. There was no way, really, to know in advance. It was a secret selection, made by the leaders of the community, the Committee of Elders, who took the responsibility so seriously that there were never even any jokes made about Assignments.\r\nHis mother seemed surprised, too. \u201CHow could you have known?\u201D she asked.\r\nHis father smiled his gentle smile. \u201CWell, it was clear to me\u2014and my parents later confessed that it had been obvious to them, too\u2014what my aptitude was. I had always loved the newchildren more than anything. When my friends in my age group were holding bicycle races, or building toy vehicles or bridges with their construction sets, or\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CAll the things I do with my friends,\u201D Jonas pointed out, and his mother nodded in agreement.\r\n\u201CI always participated, of course, because as children we must experience all of those things. And I studied hard in school, as you do, Jonas. But again and again, during free time, I found myself drawn to the newchildren. I spent almost all of my volunteer hours helping in the Nurturing Center. Of course the Elders knew that, from their observation.\u201D\r\nJonas nodded. During the past year he had been aware of the increasing level of observation. In school, at recreation time, and during volunteer hours, he had noticed the Elders watching him and the other Elevens. He had seen them taking notes. He knew, too, that the Elders were meeting for long hours with all of the instructors that he and the other Elevens had had during their years of school.\r\n\u201CSo I expected it, and I was pleased, but not at all surprised, when my Assignment was announced as Nurturer,\u201D Father explained.\r\n\u201CDid everyone applaud, even though they weren\u2019t surprised?\u201D Jonas asked.\r\n\u201COh, of course. They were happy for me, that my Assignment was what I wanted most. I felt very fortunate.\u201D His father smiled.\r\n\u201CWere any of the Elevens disappointed, your year?\u201D Jonas asked. Unlike his father, he had no idea what his Assignment would be. But he knew that some would disappoint him. Though he respected his father\u2019s work, Nurturer would not be his wish. And he didn\u2019t envy Laborers at all.\r\nHis father thought. \u201CNo, I don\u2019t think so. Of course the Elders are so careful in their observations and selections.\u201D\r\n\u201CI think it\u2019s probably the most important job in our community,\u201D his mother commented.\r\n\u201CMy friend Yoshiko was surprised by her selection as Doctor,\u201D Father said, \u201Cbut she was thrilled. And let\u2019s see, there was Andrei\u2014I remember that when we were boys he never wanted to do physical things. He spent all the recreation time he could with his construction set, and his volunteer hours were always on building sites. The Elders knew that, of course. Andrei was given the Assignment of Engineer and he was delighted.\u201D\r\n\u201CAndrei later designed the bridge that crosses the river to the west of town,\u201D Jonas\u2019s mother said. \u201CIt wasn\u2019t there when we were children.\u201D\r\n\u201CThere are very rarely disappointments, Jonas. I don\u2019t think you need to worry about that,\u201D his father reassured him. \u201CAnd if there are, you know there\u2019s an appeal process.\u201D But they all laughed at that\u2014an appeal went to a committee for study.\r\n\u201CI worry a little about Asher\u2019s Assignment,\u201D Jonas confessed. \u201CAsher\u2019s such\r\nfun. But he doesn\u2019t really have any serious interests. He makes a game out of everything.\u201D\r\nHis father chuckled. \u201CYou know,\u201D he said, \u201CI remember when Asher was a newchild at the Nurturing Center, before he was named. He never cried. He giggled and laughed at everything. All of us on the staff enjoyed nurturing Asher.\u201D\r\n\u201CThe Elders know Asher,\u201D his mother said. \u201CThey\u2019ll find exactly the right Assignment for him. I don\u2019t think you need to worry about him. But, Jonas, let me warn you about something that may not have occurred to you. I know I didn\u2019t think about it until after my Ceremony of Twelve.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat\u2019s that?\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, it\u2019s the last of the Ceremonies, as you know. After Twelve, age isn\u2019t important. Most of us even lose track of how old we are as time passes, though the information is in the Hall of Open Records, and we could go and look it up if we wanted to. What\u2019s important is the preparation for adult life, and the training you\u2019ll receive in your Assignment.\u201D\r\n\u201CI know that,\u201D Jonas said. \u201CEveryone knows that.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut it means,\u201D his mother went on, \u201Cthat you\u2019ll move into a new group. And each of your friends will. You\u2019ll no longer be spending your time with your group of Elevens. After the Ceremony of Twelve, you\u2019ll be with your Assignment group, with those in training. No more volunteer hours. No more recreation hours. So your friends will no longer be as close.\u201D\r\nJonas shook his head. \u201CAsher and I will always be friends,\u201D he said firmly. \u201CAnd there will still be school.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s true,\u201D his father agreed. \u201CBut what your mother said is true as well. There will be changes.\u201D\r\n\u201C\r\nGoodchanges, though,\u201D his mother pointed out. \u201CAfter my Ceremony of Twelve, I missed my childhood recreation. But when I entered my training for Law and Justice, I found myself with people who shared my interests. I made friends on a new level, friends of all ages.\u201D\r\n\u201CDid you still play at all, after Twelve?\u201D Jonas asked.\r\n\u201COccasionally,\u201D his mother replied. \u201CBut it didn\u2019t seem as important to me.\u201D\r\n\u201CI did,\u201D his father said, laughing. \u201CI still do. Every day, at the Nurturing Center, I play bounce-on-the-knee, and peek-a-boo, and hug-the-teddy.\u201D He reached over and stroked Jonas\u2019s neatly trimmed hair. \u201CFun doesn\u2019t end when you become Twelve.\u201D\r\nLily appeared, wearing her nightclothes, in the doorway. She gave an impatient sigh. \u201CThis is certainly a very\r\nlongprivate conversation,\u201D she said. \u201CAnd there are certain people waiting for their comfort object.\u201D\r\n\u201CLily,\u201D her mother said fondly, \u201Cyou\u2019re very close to being an Eight, and when you\u2019re an Eight, your comfort object will be taken away. It will be recycled to the younger children. You should be starting to go off to sleep without it.\u201D\r\nBut her father had already gone to the shelf and taken down the stuffed elephant which was kept there. Many of the comfort objects, like Lily\u2019s, were soft, stuffed, imaginary creatures. Jonas\u2019s had been called a bear.\r\n\u201CHere you are, Lily-billy,\u201D he said. \u201CI\u2019ll come help you remove your hair ribbons.\u201D\r\nJonas and his mother rolled their eyes, yet they watched affectionately as Lily and her father headed to her sleeping room with the stuffed elephant that had been given to her as her comfort object when she was born. His mother moved to her big desk and opened her briefcase; her work never seemed to end, even when she was at home in the evening. Jonas went to his own desk and began to sort through his school papers for the evening\u2019s assignment. But his mind was still on December and the coming Ceremony.\r\nThough he had been reassured by the talk with his parents, he hadn\u2019t the slightest idea what Assignment the Elders would be selecting for his future, or how he might feel about it when the day came.",

And he has funny eyes like yours, Jonas!\u201D Jonas glared at her. He didn\u2019t like it that she had mentioned his eyes. He waited for his father to chastise Lily. But Father was busy unstrapping the carrying basket from the back of his bicycle. Jonas walked over to look.\r\nIt was the first thing Jonas noticed as he looked at the newchild peering up curiously from the basket. The pale eyes.\r\nAlmost every citizen in the community had dark eyes. His parents did, and Lily did, and so did all of his group members and friends. But there were a few exceptions: Jonas himself, and a female Five who he had noticed had the different, lighter eyes. No one mentioned such things; it was not a rule, but was considered rude to call attention to things that were unsettling or different about individuals. Lily, he decided, would have to learn that soon, or she would be called in for chastisement because of her insensitive chatter.\r\nFather put his bike into its port. Then he picked up the basket and carried it into the house. Lily followed behind, but she glanced back over her shoulder at Jonas and teased, \u201CMaybe he had the same Birthmother as you.\u201D\r\nJonas shrugged. He followed them inside. But he had been startled by the newchild\u2019s eyes. Mirrors were rare in the community; they weren\u2019t forbidden, but there was no real need of them, and Jonas had simply never bothered to look at himself very often even when he found himself in a location where a mirror existed. Now, seeing the newchild and its expression, he was reminded that the light eyes were not only a rarity but gave the one who had them a certain look\u2014what was it?\r\nDepth,he decided; as if one were looking into the clear water of the river, down to the bottom, where things might lurk which hadn\u2019t been discovered yet. He felt self-conscious, realizing that he, too, had that look.\r\nHe went to his desk, pretending not to be interested in the newchild. On the other side of the room, Mother and Lily were bending over to watch as Father unwrapped its blanket.\r\n\u201CWhat\u2019s his comfort object called?\u201D Lily asked, picking up the stuffed creature which had been placed beside the newchild in his basket.\r\nFather glanced at it. \u201CHippo,\u201D he said.\r\nLily giggled at the strange word. \u201CHippo,\u201D she repeated, and put the comfort object down again. She peered at the unwrapped newchild, who waved his arms.\r\n\u201CI think newchildren are so cute,\u201D Lily sighed. \u201CI hope I get assigned to be a Birthmother.\u201D\r\n\u201CLily!\u201D Mother spoke very sharply. \u201CDon\u2019t say that. There\u2019s very little honor in that Assignment.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut I was talking to Natasha. You know the Ten who lives around the corner? She does some of her volunteer hours at the Birthing Center. And she told me that the Birthmothers get wonderful food, and they have very gentle exercise periods, and most of the time they just play games and amuse themselves while they\u2019re waiting. I think I\u2019d like that,\u201D Lily said petulantly.\r\n\u201CThree years,\u201D Mother told her firmly. \u201CThree births, and that\u2019s all. After that they are Laborers for the rest of their adult lives, until the day that they enter the House of the Old. Is that what you want, Lily? Three lazy years, and then hard physical labor until you are old?\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, no, I guess not,\u201D Lily acknowledged reluctantly.\r\nFather turned the newchild onto his tummy in the basket. He sat beside it and rubbed its small back with a rhythmic motion. \u201CAnyway, Lily-billy,\u201D he said affectionately, \u201Cthe Birthmothers never even get to see newchildren. If you enjoy the little ones so much, you should hope for an Assignment as Nurturer.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhen you\u2019re an Eight and start your volunteer hours, you can try some at the Nurturing Center,\u201D Mother suggested.\r\n\u201CYes, I think I will,\u201D Lily said. She knelt beside the basket. \u201CWhat did you say his name is? Gabriel? Hello, Gabriel,\u201D she said in a singsong voice. Then she giggled. \u201COops,\u201D she whispered. \u201CI think he\u2019s alseep. I guess I\u2019d better be quiet.\u201D\r\nJonas turned to the school assignments on his desk. Some chance of\r\nthat,he thought. Lily was\r\nneverquiet. Probably she should hope for an Assignment as Speaker, so that she could sit in the office with the microphone all day, making announcements. He laughed silently to himself, picturing his sister droning on in the self-important voice that all the Speakers seemed to develop, saying things like,\r\nATTENTION. THIS IS A REMINDER TO FEMALES UNDER NINE THAT HAIR RIBBONS ARE TO BE NEATLY TIED AT ALL TIMES.\r\nHe turned toward Lily and noticed to his satisfaction that her ribbons were, as usual, undone and dangling. There would be an announcement like that quite soon, he felt certain, and it would be directed mainly at Lily, though her name, of course, would not be mentioned. Everyone would know.\r\nEveryone had known, he remembered with humiliation, that the announcement\r\nATTENTION. THIS IS A REMINDER TO MALE ELEVENS THAT OBJECTS ARE NOT TO BE REMOVED FROM THE RECREATION AREA AND THAT SNACKS ARE TO BE EATEN, NOT HOARDEDhad been specifically directed at him, the day last month that he had taken an apple home. No one had mentioned it, not even his parents, because the public announcement had been sufficient to produce the appropriate remorse. He had, of course, disposed of the apple and made his apology to the Recreation Director the next morning, before school.\r\nJonas thought again about that incident. He was still bewildered by it. Not by the announcement or the necessary apology; those were standard procedures, and he had deserved them\u2014but by the incident itself. He probably should have brought up his feeling of bewilderment that very evening when the family unit had shared their feelings of the day. But he had not been able to sort out and put words to the source of his confusion, so he had let it pass.\r\nIt had happened during the recreation period, when he had been playing with Asher. Jonas had casually picked up an apple from the basket where the snacks were kept, and had thrown it to his friend. Asher had thrown it back, and they had begun a simple game of catch.\r\nThere had been nothing special about it; it was an activity that he had performed countless times: throw, catch; throw, catch. It was effortless for Jonas, and even boring, though Asher enjoyed it, and playing catch was a required activity for Asher because it would improve his hand-eye coordination, which was not up to standards.\r\nBut suddenly Jonas had noticed, following the path of the apple through the air with his eyes, that the piece of fruit had\u2014well, this was the part that he couldn\u2019t adequately understand\u2014the apple had\r\nchanged. Just for an instant. It had changed in mid-air, he remembered. Then it was in his hand, and he looked at it carefully, but it was the same apple. Unchanged. The same size and shape: a perfect sphere. The same nondescript shade, about the same shade as his own tunic.\r\nThere was absolutely nothing remarkable about that apple. He had tossed it back and forth between his hands a few times, then thrown it again to Asher. And again\u2014in the air, for an instant only\u2014it had changed.\r\nIt had happened four times. Jonas had blinked, looked around, and then tested his eyesight, squinting at the small print on the identification badge attached to his tunic. He read his name quite clearly. He could also clearly see Asher at the other end of the throwing area. And he had had no problem catching the apple.\r\nJonas had been completely mystified.\r\n\u201CAsh?\u201D he had called. \u201CDoes anything seem strange to you? About the apple?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D Asher called back, laughing. \u201CIt jumps out of my hand onto the ground!\u201D Asher had just dropped it once again.\r\nSo Jonas laughed too, and with his laughter tried to ignore his uneasy conviction that\r\nsomethinghad happened. But he had taken the apple home, against the recreation area rules. That evening, before his parents and Lily arrived at the dwelling, he had held it in his hands and looked at it carefully. It was slightly bruised now, because Asher had dropped it several times. But there was nothing at all unusual about the apple.\r\nHe had held a magnifying glass to it. He had tossed it several times across the room, watching, and then rolled it around and around on his desktop, waiting for the thing to happen again.\r\nBut it hadn\u2019t. The only thing that happened was the announcement later that evening over the speaker, the announcement that had singled him out without using his name, that had caused both of his parents to glance meaningfully at his desk where the apple still lay.\r\nNow, sitting at his desk, staring at his schoolwork as his family hovered over the newchild in its basket, he shook his head, trying to forget the odd incident. He forced himself to arrange his papers and try to study a little before the evening meal. The newchild, Gabriel, stirred and whimpered, and Father spoke softly to Lily, explaining the feeding procedure as he opened the container that held the formula and equipment.\r\nThe evening proceeded as all evenings did in the family unit, in the dwelling, in the community: quiet, reflective, a time for renewal and preparation for the day to come. It was different only in the addition to it of the newchild with his pale, solemn, knowing eyes.",

He didn\u2019t often do his volunteer hours with his friend because Asher frequently fooled around and made serious work a little difficult. But now, with Twelve coming so soon and the volunteer hours ending, it didn\u2019t seem to matter.\r\nThe freedom to choose where to spend those hours had always seemed a wonderful luxury to Jonas; other hours of the day were so carefully regulated.\r\nHe remembered when he had become an Eight, as Lily would do shortly, and had been faced with that freedom of choice. The Eights always set out on their first volunteer hour a little nervously, giggling and staying in groups of friends. They almost invariably did their hours on Recreation Duty first, helping with the younger ones in a place where they still felt comfortable. But with guidance, as they developed self-confidence and maturity, they moved on to other jobs, gravitating toward those that would suit their own interests and skills.\r\nA male Eleven named Benjamin had done his entire nearly-Four years in the Rehabilitation Center, working with citizens who had been injured. It was rumored that he was as skilled now as the Rehabilitation Directors themselves, and that he had even developed some machines and methods to hasten rehabilitation. There was no doubt that Benjamin would receive his Assignment to that field and would probably be permitted to bypass most of the training.\r\nJonas was impressed by the things Benjamin had achieved. He knew him, of course, since they had always been groupmates, but they had never talked about the boy\u2019s accomplishments because such a conversation would have been awkward for Benjamin. There was never any comfortable way to mention or discuss one\u2019s successes without breaking the rule against bragging, even if one didn\u2019t mean to. It was a minor rule, rather like rudeness, punishable only by gentle chastisement. But still. Better to steer clear of an occasion governed by a rule which would be so easy to break.\r\nThe area of dwellings behind him, Jonas rode past the community structures, hoping to spot Asher\u2019s bicycle parked beside one of the small factories or office buildings. He passed the Childcare Center where Lily stayed after school, and the play areas surrounding it. He rode through the Central Plaza and the large Auditorium where public meetings were held.\r\nJonas slowed and looked at the nametags on the bicycles lined up outside the Nurturing Center. Then he checked those outside Food Distribution; it was always fun to help with the deliveries, and he hoped he would find his friend there so that they could go together on the daily rounds, carrying the cartons of supplies into the dwellings of the community. But he finally found Asher\u2019s bicycle\u2014leaning, as usual, instead of upright in its port, as it should have been\u2014at the House of the Old.\r\nThere was only one other child\u2019s bicycle there, that of a female Eleven named Fiona. Jonas liked Fiona. She was a good student, quiet and polite, but she had a sense of fun as well, and it didn\u2019t surprise him that she was working with Asher today. He parked his bicycle neatly in the port beside theirs and entered the building.\r\n\u201CHello, Jonas,\u201D the attendant at the front desk said. She handed him the sign-up sheet and stamped her own official seal beside his signature. All of his volunteer hours would be carefully tabulated at the Hall of Open Records. Once, long ago, it was whispered among the children, an Eleven had arrived at the Ceremony of Twelve only to hear a public announcement that he had not completed the required number of volunteer hours and would not, therefore, be given his Assignment. He had been permitted an additional month in which to complete the hours, and then given his Assignment privately, with no applause, no celebration: a disgrace that had clouded his entire future.\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s good to have some volunteers here today,\u201D the attendant told him. \u201CWe celebrated a release this morning, and that always throws the schedule off a little, so things get backed up.\u201D She looked at a printed sheet. \u201CLet\u2019s see. Asher and Fiona are helping in the bathing room. Why don\u2019t you join them there? You know where it is, don\u2019t you?\u201D\r\nJonas nodded, thanked her, and walked down the long hallway. He glanced into the rooms on either side. The Old were sitting quietly, some visiting and talking with one another, others doing handwork and simple crafts. A few were asleep. Each room was comfortably furnished, the floors covered with thick carpeting. It was a serene and slow-paced place, unlike the busy centers of manufacture and distribution where the daily work of the community occurred.\r\nJonas was glad that he had, over the years, chosen to do his hours in a variety of places so that he could experience the differences. He realized, though, that not focusing on one area meant he was left with not the slightest idea\u2014not even a\r\nguess\u2014of what his Assignment would be.\r\nHe laughed softly. Thinking about the Ceremony again, Jonas? he teased himself. But he suspected that with the date so near, probably all of his friends were, too.\r\nHe passed a Caretaker walking slowly with one of the Old in the hall. \u201CHello, Jonas,\u201D the young uniformed man said, smiling pleasantly. The woman beside him, whose arm he held, was hunched over as she shuffled along in her soft slippers. She looked toward Jonas and smiled, but her dark eyes were clouded and blank. He realized she was blind.\r\nHe entered the bathing room with its warm moist air and scent of cleansing lotions. He removed his tunic, hung it carefully on a wall hook, and put on the volunteer\u2019s smock that was folded on a shelf.\r\n\u201CHi, Jonas!\u201D Asher called from the corner where he was kneeling beside a tub. Jonas saw Fiona nearby, at a different tub. She looked up and smiled at him, but she was busy, gently washing a man who lay in the warm water.\r\nJonas greeted them and the caretaking attendants at work nearby. Then he went to the row of padded lounging chairs where others of the Old were waiting. He had worked here before; he knew what to do.\r\n\u201CYour turn, Larissa,\u201D he said, reading the nametag on the woman\u2019s robe. \u201CI\u2019ll just start the water and then help you up.\u201D He pressed the button on a nearby empty tub and watched as the warm water flowed in through the many small openings on the sides. The tub would be filled in a minute and the water flow would stop automatically.\r\nHe helped the woman from the chair, led her to the tub, removed her robe, and steadied her with his hand on her arm as she stepped in and lowered herself. She leaned back and sighed with pleasure, her head on a soft cushioned headrest.\r\n\u201CComfortable?\u201D he asked, and she nodded, her eyes closed. Jonas squeezed cleansing lotion onto the clean sponge at the edge of the tub and began to wash her frail body.\r\nLast night he had watched as his father bathed the newchild. This was much the same: the fragile skin, the soothing water, the gentle motion of his hand, slippery with soap. The relaxed, peaceful smile on the woman\u2019s face reminded him of Gabriel being bathed.\r\nAnd the nakedness, too. It was against the rules for children or adults to look at another\u2019s nakedness; but the rule did not apply to newchildren or the Old. Jonas was glad. It was a nuisance to keep oneself covered while changing for games, and the required apology if one had by mistake glimpsed another\u2019s body was always awkward. He couldn\u2019t see why it was necessary. He liked the feeling of safety here in this warm and quiet room; he liked the expression of trust on the woman\u2019s face as she lay in the water unprotected, exposed, and free.\r\nFrom the corner of his eye he could see his friend Fiona help the old man from the tub and tenderly pat his thin, naked body dry with an absorbant cloth. She helped him into his robe.\r\nJonas thought Larissa had drifted into sleep, as the Old often did, and he was careful to keep his motions steady and gentle so he wouldn\u2019t wake her. He was surprised when she spoke, her eyes still closed.\r\n\u201CThis morning we celebrated the release of Roberto,\u201D she told him. \u201CIt was wonderful.\u201D\r\n\u201CI knew Roberto!\u201D Jonas said. \u201CI helped with his feeding the last time I was here, just a few weeks ago. He was a very interesting man.\u201D\r\nLarissa opened her eyes happily. \u201CThey told his whole life before they released him,\u201D she said. \u201CThey always do. But to be honest,\u201D she whispered with a mischievous look, \u201Csome of the tellings are a little boring. I\u2019ve even seen some of the Old fall asleep during tellings\u2014when they released Edna recently. Did you know Edna?\u201D\r\nJonas shook his head. He couldn\u2019t recall anyone named Edna.\r\n\u201CWell, they tried to make her life sound meaningful. And of course,\u201D she added primly, \u201Call lives\r\naremeaningful, I don\u2019t mean that they aren\u2019t. But\r\nEdna. My goodness. She was a Birthmother, and then she worked in Food Production for years, until she came here. She never even had a family unit.\u201D\r\nLarissa lifted her head and looked around to make sure no one else was listening. Then she confided, \u201CI don\u2019t think Edna was very smart.\u201D\r\nJonas laughed. He rinsed her left arm, laid it back into the water, and began to wash her feet. She murmured with pleasure as he massaged her feet with the sponge.\r\n\u201CBut Roberto\u2019s life was wonderful,\u201D Larissa went on, after a moment. \u201CHe had been an Instructor of Elevens\u2014you know how important that is\u2014and he\u2019d been on the Planning Committee. And\u2014goodness, I don\u2019t know how he found the time\u2014he also raised two very successful children, and he was\r\nalsothe one who did the landscaping design for the Central Plaza. He didn\u2019t do the actual labor, of course.\u201D\r\n\u201CNow your back. Lean forward and I\u2019ll help you sit up.\u201D Jonas put his arm around her and supported her as she sat. He squeezed the sponge against her back and began to rub her sharp-boned shoulders. \u201CTell me about the celebration.\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, there was the telling of his life. That is always first. Then the toast. We all raised our glasses and cheered. We chanted the anthem. He made a lovely good-bye speech. And several of us made little speeches wishing him well. I didn\u2019t, though. I\u2019ve never been fond of public speaking.\r\n\u201CHe was thrilled. You should have seen the look on his face when they let him go.\u201D\r\nJonas slowed the strokes of his hand on her back thoughtfully. \u201CLarissa,\u201D he asked, \u201Cwhat happens when they make the actual release? Where exactly did Roberto go?\u201D\r\nShe lifted her bare wet shoulders in a small shrug. \u201CI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think anybody does, except the committee. He just bowed to all of us and then walked, like they all do, through the special door in the Releasing Room. But you should have seen his look. Pure happiness, I\u2019d call it.\u201D\r\nJonas grinned. \u201CI wish I\u2019d been there to see it.\u201D\r\nLarissa frowned. \u201CI don\u2019t know why they don\u2019t let children come. Not enough room, I guess. They should enlarge the Releasing Room.\u201D\r\n\u201CWe\u2019ll have to suggest that to the committee. Maybe they\u2019d study it,\u201D Jonas said slyly, and Larissa chortled with laughter.\r\n\u201C\r\nRight!\u201D she hooted, and Jonas helped her from the tub.",

      "Contents": "Unknown\r\nFive\r\nU\r\nSUALLY, AT THEmorning ritual when the family members told their dreams, Jonas didn\u2019t contribute much. He rarely dreamed. Sometimes he awoke with a feeling of fragments afloat in his sleep, but he couldn\u2019t seem to grasp them and put them together into something worthy of telling at the ritual.\r\nBut this morning was different. He had dreamed very vividly the night before.\r\nHis mind wandered while Lily, as usual, recounted a lengthy dream, this one a frightening one in which she had, against the rules, been riding her mother\u2019s bicycle and been caught by the Security Guards.\r\nThey all listened carefully and discussed with Lily the warning that the dream had given.\r\n\u201CThank you for your dream, Lily.\u201D Jonas said the standard phrase automatically, and tried to pay better attention while his mother told of a dream fragment, a disquieting scene where she had been chastised for a rule infraction she didn\u2019t understand. Together they agreed that it probably resulted from her feelings when she had reluctantly dealt punishment to the citizen who had broken the major rules a second time.\r\nFather said that he had had no dreams.\r\n\u201CGabe?\u201D Father asked, looking down at the basket where the newchild lay gurgling after his feeding, ready to be taken back to the Nurturing Center for the day.\r\nThey all laughed. Dream-telling began with Threes. If newchildren dreamed, no one knew.\r\n\u201CJonas?\u201D Mother asked. They always asked, though they knew how rarely Jonas had a dream to tell.\r\n\u201CI\r\ndiddream last night,\u201D Jonas told them. He shifted in his chair, frowning.\r\n\u201CGood,\u201D Father said. \u201CTell us.\u201D\r\n\u201CThe details aren\u2019t clear, really,\u201D Jonas explained, trying to recreate the odd dream in his mind. \u201CI think I was in the bathing room at the House of the Old.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s where you were yesterday,\u201D Father pointed out.\r\nJonas nodded. \u201CBut it wasn\u2019t really the same. There was a tub, in the dream. But only one. And the real bathing room has rows and rows of them. But the room in the dream was warm and damp. And I had taken off my tunic, but hadn\u2019t put on the smock, so my chest was bare. I was perspiring, because it was so warm. And Fiona was there, the way she was yesterday.\u201D\r\n\u201CAsher, too?\u201D Mother asked.\r\nJonas shook his head. \u201CNo. It was only me and Fiona, alone in the room, standing beside the tub. She was laughing. But I wasn\u2019t. I was almost a little angry at her, in the dream, because she wasn\u2019t taking me seriously.\u201D\r\n\u201CSeriously about what?\u201D Lily asked.\r\nJonas looked at his plate. For some reason that he didn\u2019t understand, he felt slightly embarrassed. \u201CI think I was trying to convince her that she should get into the tub of water.\u201D\r\nHe paused. He knew he had to tell it all, that it was not only all right but necessary to tell\r\nallof a dream. So he forced himself to relate the part that made him uneasy.\r\n\u201CI wanted her to take off her clothes and get into the tub,\u201D he explained quickly. \u201CI wanted to bathe her. I had the sponge in my hand. But she wouldn\u2019t. She kept laughing and saying no.\u201D\r\nHe looked up at his parents. \u201CThat\u2019s all,\u201D he said.\r\n\u201CCan you describe the strongest feeling in your dream, son?\u201D Father asked.\r\nJonas thought about it. The details were murky and vague. But the feelings were clear, and flooded him again now as he thought. \u201CThe\r\nwanting,\u201D he said. \u201CI knew that she wouldn\u2019t. And I think I knew that she\r\nshouldn\u2019t. But I wanted it so terribly. I could feel the wanting all through me.\u201D\r\n\u201CThank you for your dream, Jonas,\u201D Mother said after a moment. She glanced at Father.\r\n\u201CLily,\u201D Father said, \u201Cit\u2019s time to leave for school. Would you walk beside me this morning and keep an eye on the newchild\u2019s basket? We want to be certain he doesn\u2019t wiggle himself loose.\u201D\r\nJonas began to rise to collect his schoolbooks. He thought it surprising that they hadn\u2019t talked about his dream at length before the thank you. Perhaps they found it as confusing as he had.\r\n\u201CWait, Jonas,\u201D Mother said gently. \u201CI\u2019ll write an apology to your instructor so that you won\u2019t have to speak one for being late.\u201D\r\nHe sank back down into his chair, puzzled. He waved to Father and Lily as they left the dwelling, carrying Gabe in his basket. He watched while Mother tidied the remains of the morning meal and placed the tray by the front door for the Collection Crew.\r\nFinally she sat down beside him at the table. \u201CJonas,\u201D she said with a smile, \u201Cthe feeling you described as the wanting? It was your first Stirrings. Father and I have been expecting it to happen to you. It happens to everyone. It happened to Father when he was your age. And it happened to me. It will happen someday to Lily.\r\n\u201CAnd very often,\u201D Mother added, \u201Cit begins with a dream.\u201D\r\nStirrings. He had heard the word before. He remembered that there was a reference to the Stirrings in the Book of Rules, though he didn\u2019t remember what it said. And now and then the Speaker mentioned it.\r\nATTENTION. A REMINDER THAT STIRRINGS MUST BE REPORTED IN ORDER FOR TREATMENT TO TAKE PLACE.\r\nHe had always ignored that announcement because he didn\u2019t understand it and it had never seemed to apply to him in any way. He ignored, as most citizens did, many of the commands and reminders read by the Speaker.\r\n\u201CDo I have to report it?\u201D he asked his mother.\r\nShe laughed. \u201CYou did, in the dream-telling. That\u2019s enough.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut what about the treatment? The Speaker says that treatment must take place.\u201D Jonas felt miserable. Just when the Ceremony was about to happen, his Ceremony of Twelve, would he have to go away someplace for treatment? Just because of a stupid dream?\r\nBut his mother laughed again in a reassuring, affectionate way. \u201CNo, no,\u201D she said. \u201CIt\u2019s just the pills. You\u2019re ready for the pills, that\u2019s all. That\u2019s the treatment for Stirrings.\u201D\r\nJonas brightened. He knew about the pills. His parents both took them each morning. And some of his friends did, he knew. Once he had been heading off to school with Asher, both of them on their bikes, when Asher\u2019s father had called from their dwelling doorway, \u201CYou forgot your pill, Asher!\u201D Asher had groaned good-naturedly, turned his bike, and ridden back while Jonas waited.\r\nIt was the sort of thing one didn\u2019t ask a friend about because it might have fallen into that uncomfortable category of \u201Cbeing different.\u201D Asher took a pill each morning; Jonas did not. Always better, less rude, to talk about things that were the same.\r\nNow he swallowed the small pill that his mother handed him.\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s all?\u201D he asked.\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s all,\u201D she replied, returning the bottle to the cupboard. \u201CBut you mustn\u2019t forget. I\u2019ll remind you for the first weeks, but then you must do it on your own. If you forget, the Stirrings will come back. The dreams of Stirrings will come back. Sometimes the dosage must be adjusted.\u201D\r\n\u201CAsher takes them,\u201D Jonas confided.\r\nHis mother nodded, unsurprised. \u201CMany of your groupmates probably do. The males, at least. And they all will, soon. Females too.\u201D\r\n\u201CHow long will I have to take them?\u201D\r\n\u201CUntil you enter the House of the Old,\u201D she explained. \u201CAll of your adult life. But it becomes routine; after a while you won\u2019t even pay much attention to it.\u201D\r\nShe looked at her watch. \u201CIf you leave right now, you won\u2019t even be late for school. Hurry along.\r\n\u201CAnd thank you again, Jonas,\u201D she added, as he went to the door, \u201Cfor your dream.\u201D\r\nPedaling rapidly down the path, Jonas felt oddly proud to have joined those who took the pills. For a moment, though, he remembered the dream again. The dream had felt pleasurable. Though the feelings were confused, he thought that he had liked the feelings that his mother had called Stirrings. He remembered that upon waking, he had wanted to feel the Stirrings again.\r\nThen, in the same way that his own dwelling slipped away behind him as he rounded a corner on his bicycle, the dream slipped away from his thoughts. Very briefly, a little guiltily, he tried to grasp it back. But the feelings had disappeared. The Stirrings were gone.",

Today, at least, we want them to be neatly tied and to\r\nstayneatly tied.\u201D\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t like hair ribbons. I\u2019m glad I only have to wear them one more year,\u201D Lily said irritably. \u201CNext year I get my bicycle, too,\u201D she added more cheerfully.\r\n\u201CThere are good things each year,\u201D Jonas reminded her. \u201CThis year you get to start your volunteer hours. And remember last year, when you became a Seven, you were so happy to get your front-buttoned jacket?\u201D\r\nThe little girl nodded and looked down at herself, at the jacket with its row of large buttons that designated her as a Seven. Fours, Fives, and Sixes all wore jackets that fastened down the back so that they would have to help each other dress and would learn interdependence.\r\nThe front-buttoned jacket was the first sign of independence, the first very visible symbol of growing up. The bicycle, at Nine, would be the powerful emblem of moving gradually out into the community, away from the protective family unit.\r\nLily grinned and wriggled away from her mother. \u201CAnd this year you get your Assignment,\u201D she said to Jonas in an excited voice. \u201CI hope you get Pilot. And that you take me flying!\u201D\r\n\u201CSure I will,\u201D said Jonas. \u201CAnd I\u2019ll get a special little parachute that just fits you, and I\u2019ll take you up to, oh, maybe twenty thousand feet, and open the door, and\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201C\r\nJonas,\u201D Mother warned.\r\n\u201CI was only joking,\u201D Jonas groaned. \u201CI don\u2019t want Pilot, anyway. If I get Pilot I\u2019ll put in an appeal.\u201D\r\n\u201CCome on,\u201D Mother said. She gave Lily\u2019s ribbons a final tug. \u201CJonas? Are you ready? Did you take your pill? I want to get a good seat in the Auditorium.\u201D She prodded Lily to the front door and Jonas followed.\r\nIt was a short ride to the Auditorium, Lily waving to her friends from her seat on the back of Mother\u2019s bicycle. Jonas stowed his bicycle beside Mother\u2019s and made his way through the throng to find his group.\r\nThe entire community attended the Ceremony each year. For the parents, it meant two days holiday from work; they sat together in the huge hall. Children sat with their groups until they went, one by one, to the stage.\r\nFather, though, would not join Mother in the audience right away. For the earliest ceremony, the Naming, the Nurturers brought the newchildren to the stage. Jonas, from his place in the balcony with the Elevens, searched the Auditorium for a glimpse of Father. It wasn\u2019t at all hard to spot the Nurturers\u2019 section at the front; coming from it were the wails and howls of the newchildren who sat squirming on the Nurturers\u2019 laps. At every other public ceremony, the audience was silent and attentive. But once a year, they all smiled indulgently at the commotion from the little ones waiting to receive their names and families.\r\nJonas finally caught his father\u2019s eye and waved. Father grinned and waved back, then held up the hand of the newchild on his lap, making it wave, too.\r\nIt wasn\u2019t Gabriel. Gabe was back at the Nurturing Center today, being cared for by the night crew. He had been given an unusual and special reprieve from the committee, and granted an additional year of nurturing before his Naming and Placement. Father had gone before the committee with a plea on behalf of Gabriel, who had not yet gained the weight appropriate to his days of life nor begun to sleep soundly enough at night to be placed with his family unit. Normally such a newchild would be labeled Inadequate and released from the community.\r\nInstead, as a result of Father\u2019s plea, Gabriel had been labeled Uncertain and given the additional year. He would continue to be nurtured at the Center and would spend his nights with Jonas\u2019s family unit. Each family member, including Lily, had been required to sign a pledge that they would not become attached to this little temporary guest, and that they would relinquish him without protest or appeal when he was assigned to his own family unit at next year\u2019s Ceremony.\r\nAt least, Jonas thought, after Gabriel was placed next year, they would still see him often because he would be part of the community. If he were released, they would not see him again. Ever. Those who were released\u2014even as newchildren\u2014were sent Elsewhere and never returned to the community.\r\nFather had not had to release a single newchild this year, so Gabriel would have represented a real failure and sadness. Even Jonas, though he didn\u2019t hover over the little one the way Lily and his father did, was glad that Gabe had not been released.\r\nThe first Ceremony began right on time, and Jonas watched as one after another each newchild was given a name and handed by the Nurturers to its new family unit. For some, it was a first child. But many came to the stage accompanied by another child beaming with pride to receive a little brother or sister, the way Jonas had when he was about to be a Five.\r\nAsher poked Jonas\u2019s arm. \u201CRemember when we got Phillipa?\u201D he asked in a loud whisper. Jonas nodded. It had only been last year. Asher\u2019s parents had waited quite a long time before applying for a second child. Maybe, Jonas suspected, they had been so exhausted by Asher\u2019s lively foolishness that they had needed a little time.\r\nTwo of their group, Fiona and another female named Thea, were missing temporarily, waiting with their parents to receive newchildren. But it was rare that there was such an age gap between children in a family unit.\r\nWhen her family\u2019s ceremony was completed, Fiona took the seat that had been saved for her in the row ahead of Asher and Jonas. She turned and whispered to them, \u201CHe\u2019s cute. But I don\u2019t like his name very much.\u201D She made a face and giggled. Fiona\u2019s new brother had been named Bruno. It wasn\u2019t a\r\ngreatname, Jonas thought, like\u2014well, like Gabriel, for example. But it was okay.\r\nThe audience applause, which was enthusiastic at each Naming, rose in an exuberant swell when one parental pair, glowing with pride, took a male newchild and heard him named Caleb.\r\nThis new Caleb was a replacement child. The couple had lost their first Caleb, a cheerful little Four. Loss of a child was very, very rare. The community was extraordinarily safe, each citizen watchful and protective of all children. But somehow the first little Caleb had wandered away unnoticed, and had fallen into the river. The entire community had performed the Ceremony of Loss together, murmuring the name Caleb throughout an entire day, less and less frequently, softer in volume, as the long and somber day went on, so that the little Four seemed to fade away gradually from everyone\u2019s consciousness.\r\nNow, at this special Naming, the community performed the brief Murmur-of-Replacement Ceremony, repeating the name for the first time since the loss: softly and slowly at first, then faster and with greater volume, as the couple stood on the stage with the newchild sleeping in the mother\u2019s arms. It was as if the first Caleb were returning.\r\nAnother newchild was given the name Roberto, and Jonas remembered that Roberto the Old had been released only last week. But there was no Murmur-of-Replacement Ceremony for the new little Roberto. Release was not the same as Loss.\r\nHe sat politely through the ceremonies of Two and Three and Four, increasingly bored as he was each year. Then a break for midday meal\u2014served outdoors\u2014and back again to the seats, for the Fives, Sixes, Sevens, and finally, last of the first day\u2019s ceremonies, the Eights.\r\nJonas watched and cheered as Lily marched proudly to the stage, became an Eight and received the identifying jacket that she would wear this year, this one with smaller buttons and, for the first time, pockets, indicating that she was mature enough now to keep track of her own small belongings. She stood solemnly listening to the speech of firm instructions on the responsibilities of Eight and doing volunteer hours for the first time. But Jonas could see that Lily, though she seemed attentive, was looking longingly at the row of gleaming bicycles, which would be presented tomorrow morning to the Nines.\r\nNext year, Lily-billy, Jonas thought.\r\nIt was an exhausting day, and even Gabriel, retrieved in his basket from the Nurturing Center, slept soundly that night.\r\nFinally it was the morning of the Ceremony of Twelve.\r\nNow Father sat beside Mother in the audience. Jonas could see them applauding dutifully as the Nines, one by one, wheeled their new bicycles, each with its gleaming nametag attached to the back, from the stage. He knew that his parents cringed a little, as he did, when Fritz, who lived in the dwelling next door to theirs, received his bike and almost immediately bumped into the podium with it. Fritz was a very awkward child who had been summoned for chastisement again and again. His transgressions were small ones, always: shoes on the wrong feet, schoolwork misplaced, failure to study adequately for a quiz. But each such error reflected negatively on his parents\u2019 guidance and infringed on the community\u2019s sense of order and success. Jonas and his family had not been looking forward to Fritz\u2019s bicycle, which they realized would probably too often be dropped on the front walk instead of wheeled neatly into its port.\r\nFinally the Nines were all resettled in their seats, each having wheeled a bicycle outside where it would be waiting for its owner at the end of the day. Everyone always chuckled and made small jokes when the Nines rode home for the first time. \u201CWant me to show you how to ride?\u201D older friends would call. \u201CI know you\u2019ve never been on a bike before!\u201D But invariably the grinning Nines, who in technical violation of the rule had been practicing secretly for weeks, would mount and ride off in perfect balance, training wheels never touching the ground.\r\nThen the Tens. Jonas never found the Ceremony of Ten particularly interesting\u2014only time-consuming, as each child\u2019s hair was snipped neatly into its distinguishing cut: females lost their braids at Ten, and males, too, relinquished their long childish hair and took on the more manly short style which exposed their ears.\r\nLaborers moved quickly to the stage with brooms and swept away the mounds of discarded hair. Jonas could see the parents of the new Tens stir and murmur, and he knew that this evening, in many dwellings, they would be snipping and straightening the hastily done haircuts, trimming them into a neater line.\r\nElevens. It seemed a short time ago that Jonas had undergone the Ceremony of Eleven, but he remembered that it was not one of the more interesting ones. By Eleven, one was only waiting to be Twelve. It was simply a marking of time with no meaningful changes. There was new clothing: different undergarments for the females, whose bodies were beginning to change; and longer trousers for the males, with a specially shaped pocket for the small calculator that they would use this year in school; but those were simply presented in wrapped packages without an accompanying speech.\r\nBreak for midday meal. Jonas realized he was hungry. He and his groupmates congregated by the tables in front of the Auditorium and took their packaged food. Yesterday there had been merriment at lunch, a lot of teasing and energy. But today the group stood anxiously, separate from the other children. Jonas watched the new Nines gravitate toward their waiting bicycles, each one admiring his or her nametag. He saw the Tens stroking their new shortened hair, the females shaking their heads to feel the unaccustomed lightness without the heavy braids they had worn so long.\r\n\u201CI heard about a guy who was absolutely certain he was going to be assigned Engineer,\u201D Asher muttered as they ate, \u201Cand instead they gave him Sanitation Laborer. He went out the next day, jumped into the river, swam across, and joined the next community he came to. Nobody ever saw him again.\u201D\r\nJonas laughed. \u201CSomebody made that story up, Ash,\u201D he said. \u201CMy father said he heard that story when\r\nhewas a Twelve.\u201D\r\nBut Asher wasn\u2019t reassured. He was eyeing the river where it was visible behind the Auditorium. \u201CI can\u2019t even swim very well,\u201D he said. \u201CMy swimming instructor said that I don\u2019t have the right boyishness or something.\u201D\r\n\u201CBuoyancy,\u201D Jonas corrected him.\r\n\u201CWhatever. I don\u2019t have it. I sink.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnyway,\u201D Jonas pointed out, \u201Chave you ever once known of anyone\u2014I mean really known for sure, Asher, not just heard a story about it\u2014who joined another community?\u201D\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D Asher admitted reluctantly. \u201CBut you can. It says so in the rules. If you don\u2019t fit in, you can apply for Elsewhere and be released. My mother says that once, about ten years ago, someone applied and was gone the next day.\u201D Then he chuckled. \u201CShe told me that because I was driving her crazy. She threatened to apply for Elsewhere.\u201D\r\n\u201CShe was joking.\u201D\r\n\u201CI know. But it was true, what she said, that someone did that once. She said that it was really true. Here today and gone tomorrow. Never seen again. Not even a Ceremony of Release.\u201D\r\nJonas shrugged. It didn\u2019t worry him. How could someone not fit in? The community was so meticulously ordered, the choices so carefully made.\r\nEven the Matching of Spouses was given such weighty consideration that sometimes an adult who applied to receive a spouse waited months or even\r\nyearsbefore a Match was approved and announced. All of the factors\u2014disposition, energy level, intelligence, and interests\u2014had to correspond and to interact perfectly. Jonas\u2019s mother, for example, had higher intelligence than his father; but his father had a calmer disposition. They balanced each other. Their Match, which like all Matches had been monitored by the Committee of Elders for three years before they could apply for children, had always been a successful one.\r\nLike the Matching of Spouses and the Naming and Placement of newchildren, the Assignments were scrupulously thought through by the Committee of Elders.\r\nHe was certain that his Assignment, whatever it was to be, and Asher\u2019s too, would be the right one for them. He only wished that the midday break would conclude, that the audience would reenter the Auditorium, and the suspense would end.\r\nAs if in answer to his unspoken wish, the signal came and the crowd began to move toward the doors.",

      "Contents": "Unknown\r\nSeven\r\nN\r\nOW JONAS\u2019S GROUPhad taken a new place in the Auditorium, trading with the new Elevens, so that they sat in the very front, immediately before the stage.\r\nThey were arranged by their original numbers, the numbers they had been given at birth. The numbers were rarely used after the Naming. But each child knew his number, of course. Sometimes parents used them in irritation at a child\u2019s misbehavior, indicating that mischief made one unworthy of a name. Jonas always chuckled when he heard a parent, exasperated, call sharply to a whining toddler, \u201CThat\u2019s\r\nenough,Twenty-three!\u201D\r\nJonas was Nineteen. He had been the nineteenth newchild born his year. It had meant that at his Naming, he had been already standing and bright-eyed, soon to walk and talk. It had given him a slight advantage the first year or two, a little more maturity than many of his groupmates who had been born in the later months of that year. But it evened out, as it always did, by Three.\r\nAfter Three, the children progressed at much the same level, though by their first number one could always tell who was a few months older than others in his group. Technically, Jonas\u2019s full number was Eleven-nineteen, since there were other Nineteens, of course, in each age group. And today, now that the new Elevens had been advanced this morning, there were\r\ntwoEleven-nineteens. At the midday break he had exchanged smiles with the new one, a shy female named Harriet.\r\nBut the duplication was only for these few hours. Very soon he would not be an Eleven but a Twelve, and age would no longer matter. He would be an adult, like his parents, though a new one and untrained still.\r\nAsher was Four, and sat now in the row ahead of Jonas. He would receive his Assignment fourth.\r\nFiona, Eighteen, was on his left; on his other side sat Twenty, a male named Pierre whom Jonas didn\u2019t like much. Pierre was very serious, not much fun, and a worrier and tattletale, too. \u201CHave you checked the rules, Jonas?\u201D Pierre was always whispering solemnly. \u201CI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s within the rules.\u201D Usually it was some foolish thing that no one cared about\u2014opening his tunic if it was a day with a breeze; taking a brief try on a friend\u2019s bicycle, just to experience the different feel of it.\r\nThe initial speech at the Ceremony of Twelve was made by the Chief Elder, the leader of the community who was elected every ten years. The speech was much the same each year: recollection of the time of childhood and the period of preparation, the coming responsibilities of adult life, the profound importance of Assignment, the seriousness of training to come.\r\nThen the Chief Elder moved ahead in her speech.\r\n\u201CThis is the time,\u201D she began, looking directly at them, \u201Cwhen we acknowledge differences. You Elevens have spent all your years till now learning to fit in, to standardize your behavior, to curb any impulse that might set you apart from the group.\r\n\u201CBut today we honor your differences. They have determined your futures.\u201D\r\nShe began to describe this year\u2019s group and its variety of personalities, though she singled no one out by name. She mentioned that there was one who had singular skills at caretaking, another who loved newchildren, one with unusual scientific aptitude, and a fourth for whom physical labor was an obvious pleasure. Jonas shifted in his seat, trying to recognize each reference as one of his groupmates. The caretaking skills were no doubt those of Fiona, on his left; he remembered noticing the tenderness with which she had bathed the Old. Probably the one with scientific aptitude was Benjamin, the male who had devised new, important equipment for the Rehabilitation Center.\r\nHe heard nothing that he recognized as himself, Jonas.\r\nFinally the Chief Elder paid tribute to the hard work of her committee, which had performed the observations so meticulously all year. The Committee of Elders stood and was acknowledged by applause. Jonas noticed Asher yawn slightly, covering his mouth politely with his hand.\r\nThen, at last, the Chief Elder called number One to the stage, and the Assignments began.\r\nEach announcement was lengthy, accompanied by a speech directed at the new Twelve. Jonas tried to pay attention as One, smiling happily, received her Assignment as Fish Hatchery Attendant along with words of praise for her childhood spent doing many volunteer hours there, and her obvious interest in the important process of providing nourishment for the community.\r\nNumber One\u2014her name was Madeline\u2014returned, finally, amidst applause, to her seat, wearing the new badge that designated her Fish Hatchery Attendant. Jonas was certainly glad that\r\nthatAssignment was taken; he wouldn\u2019t have wanted it. But he gave Madeline a smile of congratulation.\r\nWhen Two, a female named Inger, received her Assignment as Birthmother, Jonas remembered that his mother had called it a job without honor. But he thought that the Committee had chosen well. Inger was a nice girl though somewhat lazy, and her body was strong. She would enjoy the three years of being pampered that would follow her brief training; she would give birth easily and well; and the task of Laborer that would follow would use her strength, keep her healthy, and impose self-discipline. Inger was smiling when she resumed her seat. Birthmother was an important job, if lacking in prestige.\r\nJonas noticed that Asher looked nervous. He kept turning his head and glancing back at Jonas until the group leader had to give him a silent chastisement, a motion to sit still and face forward.\r\nThree, Isaac, was given an Assignment as Instructor of Sixes, which obviously pleased him and was well deserved. Now there were three Assignments gone, none of them ones that Jonas would have liked\u2014not that he could have been a Birthmother, anyway, he realized with amusement. He tried to sort through the list in his mind, the possible Assignments that remained. But there were so many he gave it up; and anyway, now it was Asher\u2019s turn. He paid strict attention as his friend went to the stage and stood self-consciously beside the Chief Elder.\r\n\u201CAll of us in the community know and enjoy Asher,\u201D the Chief Elder began. Asher grinned and scratched one leg with the other foot. The audience chuckled softly.\r\n\u201CWhen the committee began to consider Asher\u2019s Assignment,\u201D she went on, \u201Cthere were some possibilities that were immediately discarded. Some that would clearly not have been right for Asher.\r\n\u201CFor example,\u201D she said, smiling, \u201Cwe did not consider for an instant designating Asher an Instructor of Threes.\u201D\r\nThe audience howled with laughter. Asher laughed, too, looking sheepish but pleased at the special attention. The Instructors of Threes were in charge of the acquisition of correct language.\r\n\u201CIn fact,\u201D the Chief Elder continued, chuckling a little herself, \u201Cwe even gave a little thought to some retroactive chastisement for the one who had been\r\nAsher\u2019sInstructor of Threes so long ago. At the meeting where Asher was discussed, we retold many of the stories that we all remembered from his days of language acquisition.\r\n\u201CEspecially,\u201D she said, chuckling, \u201Cthe difference between snack and smack. Remember, Asher?\u201D\r\nAsher nodded ruefully, and the audience laughed aloud. Jonas did, too. He remembered, though he had been only a Three at the time himself.\r\nThe punishment used for small children was a regulated system of smacks with the discipline wand: a thin, flexible weapon that stung painfully when it was wielded. The Childcare specialists were trained very carefully in the discipline methods: a quick smack across the hands for a bit of minor misbehavior; three sharper smacks on the bare legs for a second offense.\r\nPoor Asher, who always talked too fast and mixed up words, even as a toddler. As a Three, eager for his juice and crackers at snacktime, he one day said \u201Csmack\u201D instead of \u201Csnack\u201D as he stood waiting in line for the morning treat.\r\nJonas remembered it clearly. He could still see little Asher, wiggling with impatience in the line. He remembered the cheerful voice call out, \u201CI want my smack!\u201D\r\nThe other Threes, including Jonas, had laughed nervously. \u201CSnack!\u201D they corrected. \u201CYou meant snack, Asher!\u201D But the mistake had been made. And precision of language was one of the most important tasks of small children. Asher had asked for a smack.\r\nThe discipline wand, in the hand of the Childcare worker, whistled as it came down across Asher\u2019s hands. Asher whimpered, cringed, and corrected himself instantly. \u201CSnack,\u201D he whispered.\r\nBut the next morning he had done it again. And again the following week. He couldn\u2019t seem to stop, though for each lapse the discipline wand came again, escalating to a series of painful lashes that left marks on Asher\u2019s legs. Eventually, for a period of time, Asher stopped talking altogether, when he was a Three.\r\n\u201CFor a while,\u201D the Chief Elder said, relating the story, \u201Cwe had a silent Asher! But he learned.\u201D\r\nShe turned to him with a smile. \u201CWhen he began to talk again, it was with greater precision. And now his lapses are very few. His corrections and apologies are very prompt. And his good humor is unfailing.\u201D The audience murmured in agreement. Asher\u2019s cheerful disposition was well-known throughout the community.\r\n\u201CAsher.\u201D She lifted her voice to make the official announcement. \u201CWe have given you the Assignment of Assistant Director of Recreation.\u201D\r\nShe clipped on his new badge as he stood beside her, beaming. Then he turned and left the stage as the audience cheered. When he had taken his seat again, the Chief Elder looked down at him and said the words that she had said now four times, and would say to each new Twelve. Somehow she gave it special meaning for each of them.\r\n\u201CAsher,\u201D she said, \u201Cthank you for your childhood.\u201D\r\nThe Assignments continued, and Jonas watched and listened, relieved now by the wonderful Assignment his best friend had been given. But he was more and more apprehensive as his own approached. Now the new Twelves in the row ahead had all received their badges. They were fingering them as they sat, and Jonas knew that each one was thinking about the training that lay ahead. For some\u2014one studious male had been selected as Doctor, a female as Engineer, and another for Law and Justice\u2014it would be years of hard work and study. Others, like Laborers and Birthmothers, would have a much shorter training period.\r\nEighteen, Fiona, on his left, was called. Jonas knew she must be nervous, but Fiona was a calm female. She had been sitting quietly, serenely, throughout the Ceremony.\r\nEven the applause, though enthusiastic, seemed serene when Fiona was given the important Assignment of Caretaker of the Old. It was perfect for such a sensitive, gentle girl, and her smile was satisfied and pleased when she took her seat beside him again.\r\nJonas prepared himself to walk to the stage when the applause ended and the Chief Elder picked up the next folder and looked down to the group to call forward the next new Twelve. He was calm now that his turn had come. He took a deep breath and smoothed his hair with his hand.\r\n\u201CTwenty,\u201D he heard her voice say clearly. \u201CPierre.\u201D\r\nShe skipped me,Jonas thought, stunned. Had he heard wrong? No. There was a sudden hush in the crowd, and he knew that the entire community realized that the Chief Elder had moved from Eighteen to Twenty, leaving a gap. On his right, Pierre, with a startled look, rose from his seat and moved to the stage.\r\nA mistake. She made a mistake. But Jonas knew, even as he had the thought, that she hadn\u2019t. The Chief Elder made no mistakes. Not at the Ceremony of Twelve.\r\nHe felt dizzy, and couldn\u2019t focus his attention. He didn\u2019t hear what Assignment Pierre received, and was only dimly aware of the applause as the boy returned, wearing his new badge. Then: Twenty-one. Twenty-two.\r\nThe numbers continued in order. Jonas sat, dazed, as they moved into the Thirties and then the Forties, nearing the end. Each time, at each announcement, his heart jumped for a moment, and he thought wild thoughts. Perhaps now she would call his name. Could he have forgotten his own number? No. He had always been Nineteen. He was sitting in the seat marked Nineteen.\r\nBut she had\r\nskippedhim. He saw the others in his group glance at him, embarrassed, and then avert their eyes quickly. He saw a worried look on the face of his group leader.\r\nHe hunched his shoulders and tried to make himself smaller in the seat. He wanted to disappear, to fade away, not to exist. He didn\u2019t dare to turn and find his parents in the crowd. He couldn\u2019t bear to see their faces darkened with shame.\r\nJonas bowed his head and searched through his mind.\r\nWhat had he done wrong?",

      "Contents": "Unknown\r\nEight\r\nT\r\nHE AUDIENCE WASclearly ill at ease. They applauded at the final Assignment; but the applause was piecemeal, no longer a crescendo of united enthusiasm. There were murmurs of confusion.\r\nJonas moved his hands together, clapping, but it was an automatic, meaningless gesture that he wasn\u2019t even aware of. His mind had shut out all of the earlier emotions: the anticipation, excitement, pride, and even the happy kinship with his friends. Now he felt only humiliation and terror.\r\nThe Chief Elder waited until the uneasy applause subsided. Then she spoke again.\r\n\u201CI know,\u201D she said in her vibrant, gracious voice, \u201Cthat you are all concerned. That you feel I have made a mistake.\u201D\r\nShe smiled. The community, relieved from its discomfort very slightly by her benign statement, seemed to breathe more easily. It was very silent.\r\nJonas looked up.\r\n\u201CI have caused you anxiety,\u201D she said. \u201CI apologize to my community.\u201D Her voice flowed over the assembled crowd.\r\n\u201CWe accept your apology,\u201D they all uttered together.\r\n\u201CJonas,\u201D she said, looking down at him, \u201CI apologize to you in particular. I caused you anguish.\u201D\r\n\u201CI accept your apology,\u201D Jonas replied shakily.\r\n\u201CPlease come to the stage now.\u201D\r\nEarlier that day, dressing in his own dwelling, he had practiced the kind of jaunty, self-assured walk that he hoped he could make to the stage when his turn came. All of that was forgotten now. He simply willed himself to stand, to move his feet that felt weighted and clumsy, to go forward, up the steps and across the platform until he stood at her side.\r\nReassuringly she placed her arm across his tense shoulders.\r\n\u201CJonas has not been assigned,\u201D she informed the crowd, and his heart sank.\r\nThen she went on. \u201CJonas has been\r\nselected.\u201D\r\nHe blinked. What did that mean? He felt a collective, questioning stir from the audience. They, too, were puzzled.\r\nIn a firm, commanding voice she announced, \u201CJonas has been selected to be our next Receiver of Memory.\u201D\r\nThen he heard the gasp\u2014the sudden intake of breath, drawn sharply in astonishment, by each of the seated citizens. He saw their faces; the eyes widened in awe.\r\nAnd still he did not understand.\r\n\u201CSuch a selection is very, very rare,\u201D the Chief Elder told the audience. \u201COur community has only one Receiver. It is he who trains his successor.\r\n\u201CWe have had our current Receiver for a very long time,\u201D she went on. Jonas followed her eyes and saw that she was looking at one of the Elders. The Committee of Elders was sitting together in a group; and the Chief Elder\u2019s eyes were now on one who sat in the midst but seemed oddly separate from them. It was a man Jonas had never noticed before, a bearded man with pale eyes. He was watching Jonas intently.\r\n\u201CWe failed in our last selection,\u201D the Chief Elder said solemnly. \u201CIt was ten years ago, when Jonas was just a toddler. I will not dwell on the experience because it causes us all terrible discomfort.\u201D\r\nJonas didn\u2019t know what she was referring to, but he could sense the discomfort of the audience. They shifted uneasily in their seats.\r\n\u201CWe have not been hasty this time,\u201D she continued. \u201CWe could not afford another failure.\u201D\r\n\u201CSometimes,\u201D she went on, speaking now in a lighter tone, relaxing the tension in the Auditorium, \u201Cwe are not entirely certain about the Assignments, even after the most painstaking observations. Sometimes we worry that the one assigned might not develop, through training, every attribute necessary. Elevens are still children, after all. What we observe as playfulness and patience\u2014the requirements to become Nurturer\u2014could, with maturity, be revealed as simply foolishness and indolence. So we continue to observe during training, and to modify behavior when necessary.\r\n\u201CBut the Receiver-in-training cannot be observed, cannot be modified. That is stated quite clearly in the rules. He is to be alone, apart, while he is prepared by the current Receiver for the job which is the most honored in our community.\u201D\r\nAlone? Apart? Jonas listened with increasing unease.\r\n\u201CTherefore the selection must be sound. It must be a unanimous choice of the Committee. They can have no doubts, however fleeting. If, during the process, an Elder reports a dream of uncertainty, that dream has the power to set a candidate aside instantly.\r\n\u201CJonas was identified as a possible Receiver many years ago. We have observed him meticulously. There were no dreams of uncertainty.\r\n\u201CHe has shown all of the qualities that a Receiver must have.\u201D\r\nWith her hand still firmly on his shoulder, the Chief Elder listed the qualities.\r\n\u201C\r\nIntelligence,\u201D she said. \u201CWe are all aware that Jonas has been a top student throughout his school days.\r\n\u201C\r\nIntegrity,\u201D she said next. \u201CJonas has, like all of us, committed minor transgressions.\u201D She smiled at him. \u201CWe expect that. We hoped, also, that he would present himself promptly for chastisement, and he has always done so.\r\n\u201C\r\nCourage,\u201D she went on. \u201COnly one of us here today has ever undergone the rigorous training required of a Receiver. He, of course, is the most important member of the Committee: the current Receiver. It was he who reminded us, again and again, of the courage required.\r\n\u201CJonas,\u201D she said, turning to him, but speaking in a voice that the entire community could hear, \u201Cthe training required of you involves pain. Physical pain.\u201D\r\nHe felt fear flutter within him.\r\n\u201CYou have never experienced that. Yes, you have scraped your knees in falls from your bicycle. Yes, you crushed your finger in a door last year.\u201D\r\nJonas nodded, agreeing, as he recalled the incident, and its accompanying misery.\r\n\u201CBut you will be faced, now,\u201D she explained gently, \u201Cwith pain of a magnitude that none of us here can comprehend because it is beyond our experience. The Receiver himself was not able to describe it, only to remind us that you would be faced with it, that you would need immense courage. We cannot prepare you for that.\r\n\u201CBut we feel certain that you are brave,\u201D she said to him.\r\nHe did not feel brave at all. Not now.\r\n\u201CThe fourth essential attribute,\u201D the Chief Elder said, \u201Cis\r\nwisdom. Jonas has not yet acquired that. The acquisition of wisdom will come through his training.\r\n\u201CWe are convinced that Jonas has the ability to acquire wisdom. That is what we looked for.\r\n\u201CFinally, The Receiver must have one more quality, and it is one which I can only name, but not describe. I do not understand it. You members of the community will not understand it, either. Perhaps Jonas will, because the current Receiver has told us that Jonas already has this quality. He calls it the Capacity to See Beyond.\u201D\r\nThe Chief Elder looked at Jonas with a question in her eyes. The audience watched him, too. They were silent.\r\nFor a moment he froze, consumed with despair. He\r\ndidn\u2019thave it, the whatever-she-had-said. He didn\u2019t know what it was. Now was the moment when he would have to confess, to say, \u201CNo, I don\u2019t. I\r\ncan\u2019t,\u201D and throw himself on their mercy, ask their forgiveness, to explain that he had been wrongly chosen, that he was not the right one at all.\r\nBut when he looked out across the crowd, the sea of faces, the thing happened again. The thing that had happened with the apple.\r\nThey\r\nchanged.\r\nHe blinked, and it was gone. His shoulders straightened slightly. Briefly he felt a tiny sliver of sureness for the first time.\r\nShe was still watching him. They all were.\r\n\u201CI think it\u2019s true,\u201D he told the Chief Elder and the community. \u201CI don\u2019t understand it yet. I don\u2019t know what it is. But sometimes I see something. And maybe it\u2019s beyond.\u201D\r\nShe took her arm from his shoulders.\r\n\u201CJonas,\u201D she said, speaking not to him alone but to the entire community of which he was a part, \u201Cyou will be trained to be our next Receiver of Memory. We thank you for your childhood.\u201D\r\nThen she turned and left the stage, left him there alone, standing and facing the crowd, which began spontaneously the collective murmur of his name.\r\n\u201CJonas.\u201D It was a whisper at first: hushed, barely audible. \u201CJonas. Jonas.\u201D\r\nThen louder, faster. \u201CJONAS. JONAS. JONAS.\u201D\r\nWith the chant, Jonas knew, the community was accepting him and his new role, giving him life, the way they had given it to the newchild Caleb. His heart swelled with gratitude and pride.\r\nBut at the same time he was filled with fear. He did not know what his selection meant. He did not know what he was to become.\r\nOr what would become of him.",

      "Contents": "Unknown\r\nNine\r\nN\r\nOW, FOR THEfirst time in his twelve years of life, Jonas felt separate, different. He remembered what the Chief Elder had said: that his training would be alone and apart.\r\nBut his training had not yet begun and already, upon leaving the Auditorium, he felt the apartness. Holding the folder she had given him, he made his way through the throng, looking for his family unit and for Asher. People moved aside for him. They watched him. He thought he could hear whispers.\r\n\u201CAsh!\u201D he called, spotting his friend near the rows of bicycles. \u201CRide back with me?\u201D\r\n\u201CSure.\u201D Asher smiled, his usual smile, friendly and familiar. But Jonas felt a moment of hesitation from his friend, an uncertainty.\r\n\u201CCongratulations,\u201D Asher said.\r\n\u201CYou too,\u201D Jonas replied. \u201CIt was really funny, when she told about the smacks. You got more applause than almost anybody else.\u201D\r\nThe other new Twelves clustered nearby, placing their folders carefully into the carrying containers on the backs of the bikes. In each dwelling tonight they would be studying the instructions for the beginning of their training. Each night for years the children had memorized the required lessons for school, often yawning with boredom. Tonight they would all begin eagerly to memorize the rules for their adult Assignments.\r\n\u201CCongratulations, Asher!\u201D someone called. Then that hesitation again. \u201CYou too, Jonas!\u201D\r\nAsher and Jonas responded with congratulations to their groupmates. Jonas saw his parents watching him from the place where their own bicycles were waiting. Lily had already been strapped into her seat.\r\nHe waved. They waved back, smiling, but he noticed that Lily was watching him solemnly, her thumb in her mouth.\r\nHe rode directly to his dwelling, exchanging only small jokes and unimportant remarks with Asher.\r\n\u201CSee you in the morning, Recreation Director!\u201D he called, dismounting by his door as Asher continued on.\r\n\u201CRight! See you!\u201D Asher called back. Once again, there was just a moment when things weren\u2019t quite the same, weren\u2019t quite as they had always been through the long friendship. Perhaps he had imagined it. Things couldn\u2019t change, with Asher.\r\nThe evening meal was quieter than usual. Lily chattered about her plans for volunteer work; she would begin, she said, at the Nurturing Center, since she was already an expert at feeding Gabriel.\r\n\u201CI know,\u201D she added quickly, when her father gave her a warning glance, \u201CI won\u2019t mention his name. I know I\u2019m not supposed to know his name.\r\n\u201CI can\u2019t wait for tomorrow to come,\u201D she said happily.\r\nJonas sighed uneasily. \u201CI can,\u201D he muttered.\r\n\u201CYou\u2019ve been greatly honored,\u201D his mother said. \u201CYour father and I are very proud.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s the most important job in the community,\u201D Father said.\r\n\u201CBut just the other night, you said that the job of making Assignments was the most important!\u201D\r\nMother nodded. \u201CThis is different. It\u2019s not a\r\njob,really. I never thought, never expected\u2014\u201D She paused. \u201CThere\u2019s only one Receiver.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut the Chief Elder said that they had made a selection before, and that it failed. What was she talking about?\u201D\r\nBoth of his parents hesitated. Finally his father described the previous selection. \u201CIt was very much as it was today, Jonas\u2014the same suspense, as one Eleven had been passed over when the Assignments were given. Then the announcement, when they singled out the one\u2014\u201D\r\nJonas interrupted. \u201CWhat was his name?\u201D\r\nHis mother replied, \u201CHer, not his. It was a female. But we are never to speak the name, or to use it again for a newchild.\u201D\r\nJonas was shocked. A name designated Not-to-Be-Spoken indicated the highest degree of disgrace.\r\n\u201CWhat happened to her?\u201D he asked nervously.\r\nBut his parents looked blank. \u201CWe don\u2019t know,\u201D his father said uncomfortably. \u201CWe never saw her again.\u201D\r\nA silence fell over the room. They looked at each other. Finally his mother, rising from the table, said, \u201CYou\u2019ve been greatly honored, Jonas. Greatly honored.\u201D\r\nAlone in his sleepingroom, prepared for bed, Jonas opened his folder at last. Some of the other Twelves, he had noticed, had been given folders thick with printed pages. He imagined Benjamin, the scientific male in his group, beginning to read pages of rules and instructions with relish. He pictured Fiona smiling her gentle smile as she bent over the lists of duties and methods that she would be required to learn in the days to come.\r\nBut his own folder was startlingly close to empty. Inside there was only a single printed sheet. He read it twice.\r\nJONAS\r\nRECEIVER OF MEMORY\r\nGo immediately at the end of school hours each day to the Annex entrance behind the House of the Old and present yourself to the attendant.\r\nGo immediately to your dwelling at the conclusion of Training Hours each day.\r\nFrom this moment you are exempted from rules governing rudeness. You may ask any question of any citizen and you will receive answers.\r\nDo not discuss your training with any other member of the community, including parents and Elders.\r\nFrom this moment you are prohibited from dream-telling.\r\nExcept for illness or injury unrelated to your training, do not apply for any medication.\r\nYou are not permitted to apply for release.\r\nYou may lie.\r\nJonas was stunned. What would happen to his friendships? His mindless hours playing ball, or riding his bike along the river? Those had been happy and vital times for him. Were they to be completely taken from him, now? The simple logistic instructions\u2014where to go, and when\u2014were expected. Every Twelve had to be told, of course, where and how and when to report for training. But he was a little dismayed that his schedule left no time, apparently, for recreation.\r\nThe exemption from rudeness startled him. Reading it again, however, he realized that it didn\u2019t compel him to be rude; it simply allowed him the option. He was quite certain he would never take advantage of it. He was so completely, so thoroughly accustomed to courtesy within the community that the thought of asking another citizen an intimate question, of calling someone\u2019s attention to an area of awkwardness, was unnerving.\r\nThe prohibition of dream-telling, he thought, would not be a real problem. He dreamed so rarely that the dream-telling did not come easily to him anyway, and he was glad to be excused from it. He wondered briefly, though, how to deal with it at the morning meal. What if he\r\ndiddream\u2014should he simply tell his family unit, as he did so often, anyway, that he hadn\u2019t? That would be a lie. Still, the final rule said .\u00A0.\u00A0. well, he wasn\u2019t quite ready to think about the final rule on the page.\r\nThe restriction of medication unnerved him. Medication was always available to citizens, even to children, through their parents. When he had crushed his finger in the door, he had quickly, gasping into the speaker, notified his mother; she had hastily requisitioned relief-of-pain medication which had promptly been delivered to his dwelling. Almost instantly the excruciating pain in his hand had diminished to the throb which was, now, all he could recall of the experience.\r\nRe-reading rule number 6, he realized that a crushed finger fell into the category of \u201Cunrelated to training.\u201D So if it ever happened again\u2014and he was quite certain it wouldn\u2019t; he had been very careful near heavy doors since the accident!\u2014he could still receive medication.\r\nThe pill he took now, each morning, was also unrelated to training. So he would continue to receive the pill.\r\nBut he remembered uneasily what the Chief Elder had said about the pain that would come with his training. She had called it indescribable.\r\nJonas swallowed hard, trying without success to imagine what such pain might be like, with no medication at all. But it was beyond his comprehension.\r\nHe felt no reaction to rule number 7 at all. It had never occurred to him that under any circumstances, ever, he might apply for release.\r\nFinally he steeled himself to read the final rule again. He had been trained since earliest childhood, since his earliest learning of language, never to lie. It was an integral part of the learning of precise speech. Once, when he had been a Four, he had said, just prior to the midday meal at school, \u201CI\u2019m starving.\u201D\r\nImmediately he had been taken aside for a brief private lesson in language precision. He was not starving, it was pointed out. He was\r\nhungry. No one in the community was starving, had ever been starving, would ever be starving. To say \u201Cstarving\u201D was to speak a lie. An unintentioned lie, of course. But the reason for precision of language was to ensure that unintentional lies were never uttered. Did he understand that? they asked him. And he had.\r\nHe had never, within his memory, been tempted to lie. Asher did not lie. Lily did not lie. His parents did not lie. No one did. Unless .\u00A0.\u00A0.\r\nNow Jonas had a thought that he had never had before. This new thought was frightening. What if\r\nothers\u2014adults\u2014had, upon becoming Twelves, received in\r\ntheirinstructions the same terrifying sentence?\r\nWhat if they had all been instructed:\r\nYou may lie?\r\nHis mind reeled. Now, empowered to ask questions of utmost rudeness\u2014and promised answers\u2014he\r\ncould,conceivably (though it was almost unimaginable), ask someone, some adult, his father perhaps: \u201CDo you lie?\u201D\r\nBut he would have no way of knowing if the answer he received were true.",

      "Contents": "Unknown\r\nTen\r\n\u201CI\r\nGO IN HERE, Jonas,\u201D Fiona told him when they reached the front door of the House of the Old after parking their bicycles in the designated area.\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know why I\u2019m nervous,\u201D she confessed. \u201CI\u2019ve been here so often before.\u201D She turned her folder over in her hands.\r\n\u201CWell, everything\u2019s different now,\u201D Jonas reminded her.\r\n\u201CEven the nameplates on our bikes,\u201D Fiona laughed. During the night the nameplate of each new Twelve had been removed by the Maintenance Crew and replaced with the style that indicated citizen-in-training.\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t want to be late,\u201D she said hastily, and started up the steps. \u201CIf we finish at the same time, I\u2019ll ride home with you.\u201D\r\nJonas nodded, waved to her, and headed around the building toward the Annex, a small wing attached to the back. He certainly didn\u2019t want to be late for his first day of training, either.\r\nThe Annex was very ordinary, its door unremarkable. He reached for the heavy handle, then noticed a buzzer on the wall. So he buzzed instead.\r\n\u201CYes?\u201D The voice came through a small speaker above the buzzer.\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s, uh, Jonas. I\u2019m the new\u2014I mean\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CCome in.\u201D A click indicated that the door had been unlatched.\r\nThe lobby was very small and contained only a desk at which a female Attendant sat working on some papers. She looked up when he entered; then, to his surprise, she stood. It was a small thing, the standing; but no one had ever stood automatically to acknowledge Jonas\u2019s presence before.\r\n\u201CWelcome, Receiver of Memory,\u201D she said respectfully.\r\n\u201COh, please,\u201D he replied uncomfortably. \u201CCall me Jonas.\u201D\r\nShe smiled, pushed a button, and he heard a click that unlocked the door to her left. \u201CYou may go right on in,\u201D she told him.\r\nThen she seemed to notice his discomfort and to realize its origin. No doors in the community were locked, ever. None that Jonas knew of, anyway.\r\n\u201CThe locks are simply to insure The Receiver\u2019s privacy because he needs concentration,\u201D she explained. \u201CIt would be difficult if citizens wandered in, looking for the Department of Bicycle Repair, or something.\u201D\r\nJonas laughed, relaxing a little. The woman seemed very friendly, and it was true\u2014in fact it was a joke throughout the community\u2014that the Department of Bicycle Repair, an unimportant little office, was relocated so often that no one ever knew where it was.\r\n\u201CThere is nothing dangerous here,\u201D she told him.\r\n\u201CBut,\u201D she added, glancing at the wall clock, \u201Che doesn\u2019t like to be kept waiting.\u201D\r\nJonas hurried through the door and found himself in a comfortably furnished living area. It was not unlike his own family unit\u2019s dwelling. Furniture was standard throughout the community: practical, sturdy, the function of each piece clearly defined. A bed for sleeping. A table for eating. A desk for studying.\r\nAll of those things were in this spacious room, though each was slightly different from those in his own dwelling. The fabrics on the upholstered chairs and sofa were slightly thicker and more luxurious; the table legs were not straight like those at home, but slender and curved, with a small carved decoration at the foot. The bed, in an alcove at the far end of the room, was draped with a splendid cloth embroidered over its entire surface with intricate designs.\r\nBut the most conspicuous difference was the books. In his own dwelling, there were the necessary reference volumes that each household contained: a dictionary, and the thick community volume which contained descriptions of every office, factory, building, and committee. And the Book of Rules, of course.\r\nThe books in his own dwelling were the only books that Jonas had ever seen. He had never known that other books existed.\r\nBut this room\u2019s walls were completely covered by bookcases, filled, which reached to the ceiling. There must have been hundreds\u2014perhaps thousands\u2014of books, their titles embossed in shiny letters.\r\nJonas stared at them. He couldn\u2019t imagine what the thousands of pages contained. Could there be rules beyond the rules that governed the community? Could there be more descriptions of offices and factories and committees?\r\nHe had only a second to look around because he was aware that the man sitting in a chair beside the table was watching him. Hastily he moved forward, stood before the man, bowed slightly, and said, \u201CI\u2019m Jonas.\u201D\r\n\u201CI know. Welcome, Receiver of Memory.\u201D\r\nJonas recognized the man. He was the Elder who had seemed separate from the others at the Ceremony, though he was dressed in the same special clothing that only Elders wore.\r\nJonas looked self-consciously into the pale eyes that mirrored his own.\r\n\u201CSir, I apologize for my lack of understanding\u00A0.\u00A0.\u00A0.\u201D\r\nHe waited, but the man did not give the standard accepting-of-apology response.\r\nAfter a moment, Jonas went on, \u201CBut I thought\u2014I mean I\r\nthink,\u201D he corrected, reminding himself that if precision of language were ever to be important, it was certainly important\r\nnow,in the presence of this man, \u201Cthat\r\nyouare the Receiver of Memory. I\u2019m only, well, I was only assigned, I mean selected, yesterday. I\u2019m not anything at all. Not yet.\u201D\r\nThe man looked at him thoughtfully, silently. It was a look that combined interest, curiosity, concern, and perhaps a little sympathy as well.\r\nFinally he spoke. \u201CBeginning today, this moment, at least to me, you are The Receiver.\r\n\u201CI have been The Receiver for a long time. A very, very long time. You can see that, can\u2019t you?\u201D\r\nJonas nodded. The man was wrinkled, and his eyes, though piercing in their unusual lightness, seemed tired. The flesh around them was darkened into shadowed circles.\r\n\u201CI can see that you are very old,\u201D Jonas responded with respect. The Old were always given the highest respect.\r\nThe man smiled. He touched the sagging flesh on his own face with amusement. \u201CI am not, actually, as old as I look,\u201D he told Jonas. \u201CThis job has aged me. I know I look as if I should be scheduled for release very soon. But actually I have a good deal of time left.\r\n\u201CI was pleased, though, when you were selected. It took them a long time. The failure of the previous selection was ten years ago, and my energy is starting to diminish. I need what strength I have remaining for your training. We have hard and painful work to do, you and I.\r\n\u201CPlease sit down,\u201D he said, and gestured toward the nearby chair. Jonas lowered himself onto the soft cushioned seat.\r\nThe man closed his eyes and continued speaking. \u201CWhen I became a Twelve, I was selected, as you were. I was frightened, as I\u2019m sure you are.\u201D He opened his eyes for a moment and peered at Jonas, who nodded.\r\nThe eyes closed again. \u201CI came to this very room to begin my training. It was such a long time ago.\r\n\u201CThe previous Receiver seemed just as old to me as I do to you. He was just as tired as I am today.\u201D\r\nHe sat forward suddenly, opened his eyes, and said, \u201CYou may ask questions. I have so little experience in describing this process. It is forbidden to talk of it.\u201D\r\n\u201CI know, sir. I have read the instructions,\u201D Jonas said.\r\n\u201CSo I may neglect to make things as clear as I should.\u201D The man chuckled. \u201CMy job is important and has enormous honor. But that does not mean I am perfect, and when I tried before to train a successor, I failed. Please ask any questions that will help you.\u201D\r\nIn his mind, Jonas had questions. A thousand. A\r\nmillionquestions. As many questions as there were books lining the walls. But he did not ask one, not yet.\r\nThe man sighed, seeming to put his thoughts in order. Then he spoke again. \u201CSimply stated,\u201D he said, \u201Calthough it\u2019s not really simple at all, my job is to transmit to you all the memories I have within me. Memories of the past.\u201D\r\n\u201CSir,\u201D Jonas said tentatively, \u201CI would be very interested to hear the story of your life, and to listen to your memories.\r\n\u201CI apologize for interrupting,\u201D he added quickly.\r\nThe man waved his hand impatiently. \u201CNo apologies in this room. We haven\u2019t time.\u201D\r\n\u201CWell,\u201D Jonas went on, uncomfortably aware that he might be interrupting again, \u201CI am really interested, I don\u2019t mean that I\u2019m not. But I don\u2019t exactly understand why it\u2019s so important. I could do some adult job in the community, and in my recreation time I could come and listen to the stories from your childhood. I\u2019d like that. Actually,\u201D he added, \u201CI\u2019ve done that already, in the House of the Old. The Old like to tell about their childhoods, and it\u2019s always fun to listen.\u201D\r\nThe man shook his head. \u201CNo, no,\u201D he said. \u201CI\u2019m not being clear. It\u2019s not my past, not my childhood that I must transmit to you.\u201D\r\nHe leaned back, resting his head against the back of the upholstered chair. \u201CIt\u2019s the memories of the whole world,\u201D he said with a sigh. \u201CBefore you, before me, before the previous Receiver, and generations before him.\u201D\r\nJonas frowned. \u201CThe whole world?\u201D he asked. \u201CI don\u2019t understand. Do you mean not just us? Not just the community? Do you mean Elsewhere, too?\u201D He tried, in his mind, to grasp the concept. \u201CI\u2019m sorry, sir. I don\u2019t understand exactly. Maybe I\u2019m not smart enough. I don\u2019t know what you mean when you say \u2018the whole world\u2019 or \u2018generations before him.\u2019 I thought there was only us. I thought there was only now.\u201D\r\n\u201CThere\u2019s much more. There\u2019s all that goes beyond\u2014all that is Elsewhere\u2014and all that goes back, and back, and back. I received all of those, when I was selected. And here in this room, all alone, I re-experience them again and again. It is how wisdom comes. And how we shape our future.\u201D\r\nHe rested for a moment, breathing deeply. \u201CI am so\r\nweightedwith them,\u201D he said.\r\nJonas felt a terrible concern for the man, suddenly.\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s as if .\u00A0.\u00A0.\u201D The man paused, seeming to search his mind for the right words of description. \u201CIt\u2019s like going downhill through deep snow on a sled,\u201D he said, finally. \u201CAt first it\u2019s exhilarating: the speed; the sharp, clear air; but then the snow accumulates, builds up on the runners, and you slow, you have to push hard to keep going, and\u2014\u201D\r\nHe shook his head suddenly, and peered at Jonas. \u201CThat meant nothing to you, did it?\u201D he asked.\r\nJonas was confused. \u201CI didn\u2019t understand it, sir.\u201D\r\n\u201COf course you didn\u2019t. You don\u2019t know what snow is, do you?\u201D\r\nJonas shook his head.\r\n\u201COr a sled? Runners?\u201D\r\n\u201CNo, sir,\u201D Jonas said.\r\n\u201CDownhill? The term means nothing to you?\u201D\r\n\u201CNothing, sir.\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, it\u2019s a place to start. I\u2019d been wondering how to begin. Move to the bed, and lie face down. Remove your tunic first.\u201D\r\nJonas did so, a little apprehensively. Beneath his bare chest, he felt the soft folds of the magnificent cloth that covered the bed. He watched as the man rose and moved first to the wall where the speaker was. It was the same sort of speaker that occupied a place in every dwelling, but one thing about it was different. This one had a switch, which the man deftly snapped to the end that said\r\nOFF.\r\nJonas almost gasped aloud. To have the power to turn the speaker\r\noff!It was an astonishing thing.\r\nThen the man moved with surprising quickness to the corner where the bed was. He sat on a chair beside Jonas, who was motionless, waiting for what would happen next.\r\n\u201CClose your eyes. Relax. This will not be painful.\u201D\r\nJonas remembered that he was allowed, that he had even been encouraged, to ask questions. \u201CWhat are you going to do, sir?\u201D he asked, hoping that his voice didn\u2019t betray his nervousness.\r\n\u201CI am going to transmit the memory of snow,\u201D the old man said, and placed his hands on Jonas\u2019s bare back.",

      "Contents": "Unknown\r\nEleven\r\nJ\r\nONAS FELT NOTHINGunusual at first. He felt only the light touch of the old man\u2019s hands on his back.\r\nHe tried to relax, to breathe evenly. The room was absolutely silent, and for a moment Jonas feared that he might disgrace himself now, on the first day of his training, by falling asleep.\r\nThen he shivered. He realized that the touch of the hands felt, suddenly, cold. At the same instant, breathing in, he felt the air change, and his very breath was cold. He licked his lips, and in doing so, his tongue touched the suddenly chilled air.\r\nIt was very startling; but he was not at all frightened, now. He was filled with energy, and he breathed again, feeling the sharp intake of frigid air. Now, too, he could feel cold air swirling around his entire body. He felt it blow against his hands where they lay at his sides, and over his back.\r\nThe touch of the man\u2019s hands seemed to have disappeared.\r\nNow he became aware of an entirely new sensation: pinpricks? No, because they were soft and without pain. Tiny, cold, featherlike feelings peppered his body and face. He put out his tongue again, and caught one of the dots of cold upon it. It disappeared from his awareness instantly; but he caught another, and another. The sensation made him smile.\r\nOne part of his consciousness knew that he was still lying there, on the bed, in the Annex room. Yet another, separate part of his being was upright now, in a sitting position, and beneath him he could feel that he was not on the soft decorated bedcovering at all, but rather seated on a flat, hard surface. His hands now held (though at the same time they were still motionless at his sides) a rough, damp rope.\r\nAnd he could\r\nsee,though his eyes were closed. He could see a bright, whirling torrent of crystals in the air around him, and he could see them gather on the backs of his hands, like cold fur.\r\nHis breath was visible.\r\nBeyond, through the swirl of what he now, somehow, perceived was the thing the old man had spoken of\u2014\r\nsnow\u2014he could look out and down a great distance. He was up high someplace. The ground was thick with the furry snow, but he sat slightly above it on a hard, flat object.\r\nSled, he knew abruptly. He was sitting on a thing called\r\nsled. And the sled itself seemed to be poised at the top of a long, extended mound that rose from the very land where he was. Even as he thought the word \u201Cmound,\u201D his new consciousness told him\r\nhill.\r\nThen the sled, with Jonas himself upon it, began to move through the snowfall, and he understood instantly that now he was going downhill. No voice made an explanation. The experience explained itself to him.\r\nHis face cut through the frigid air as he began the descent, moving through the substance called snow on the vehicle called sled, which propelled itself on what he now knew without doubt to be\r\nrunners.\r\nComprehending all of those things as he sped downward, he was free to enjoy the breathless glee that overwhelmed him: the speed, the clear cold air, the total silence, the feeling of balance and excitement and peace.\r\nThen, as the angle of incline lessened, as the mound\u2014the\r\nhill\u2014flattened, nearing the bottom, the sled\u2019s forward motion slowed. The snow was piled now around it, and he pushed with his body, moving it forward, not wanting the exhilarating ride to end.\r\nFinally the obstruction of the piled snow was too much for the thin runners of the sled, and he came to a stop. He sat there for a moment, panting, holding the rope in his cold hands. Tentatively he opened his eyes\u2014not his snow\u2013hill\u2013sled eyes, for they had been open throughout the strange ride. He opened his ordinary eyes, and saw that he was still on the bed, that he had not moved at all.\r\nThe old man, still beside the bed, was watching him. \u201CHow do you feel?\u201D he asked.\r\nJonas sat up and tried to answer honestly. \u201CSurprised,\u201D he said, after a moment.\r\nThe old man wiped his forehead with his sleeve. \u201CWhew,\u201D he said. \u201CIt was exhausting. But you know, even transmitting that tiny memory to you\u2014I think it lightened me just a little.\u201D\r\n\u201CDo you mean\u2014you did say I could ask questions?\u201D\r\nThe man nodded, encouraging his question.\r\n\u201CDo you mean that now you don\u2019t have the memory of it\u2014of that ride on the sled\u2014anymore?\u201D\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s right. A little weight off this old body.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut it was such fun! And now you don\u2019t have it anymore! I\r\ntookit from you!\u201D\r\nBut the old man laughed. \u201CAll I gave you was one ride, on one sled, in one snow, on one hill. I have a whole world of them in my memory. I could give them to you one by one, a thousand times, and there would still be more.\u201D\r\n\u201CAre you saying that I\u2014I mean we\u2014could do it again?\u201D Jonas asked. \u201CI\u2019d really like to. I think I could steer, by pulling the rope. I didn\u2019t try this time, because it was so new.\u201D\r\nThe old man, laughing, shook his head. \u201CMaybe another day, for a treat. But there\u2019s no time, really, just to play. I only wanted to begin by showing you how it works.\r\n\u201CNow,\u201D he said, turning businesslike, \u201Clie back down. I want to\u2014\u201D\r\nJonas did. He was eager for whatever experience would come next. But he had, suddenly, so many questions.\r\n\u201CWhy don\u2019t we have snow, and sleds, and hills?\u201D he asked. \u201CAnd when did we, in the past? Did my parents have sleds when they were young? Did you?\u201D\r\nThe old man shrugged and gave a short laugh. \u201CNo,\u201D he told Jonas. \u201CIt\u2019s a very distant memory. That\u2019s why it was so exhausting\u2014I had to tug it forward from many generations back. It was given to me when I was a new Receiver, and the previous Receiver had to pull it through a long time period, too.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut what happened to those things? Snow, and the rest of it?\u201D\r\n\u201CClimate Control. Snow made growing food difficult, limited the agricultural periods. And unpredictable weather made transportation almost impossible at times. It wasn\u2019t a practical thing, so it became obsolete when we went to Sameness.\r\n\u201CAnd hills, too,\u201D he added. \u201CThey made conveyance of goods unwieldy. Trucks; buses. Slowed them down. So\u2014\u201D He waved his hand, as if a gesture had caused hills to disappear. \u201CSameness,\u201D he concluded.\r\nJonas frowned. \u201CI wish we had those things, still. Just now and then.\u201D\r\nThe old man smiled. \u201CSo do I,\u201D he said. \u201CBut that choice is not ours.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut sir,\u201D Jonas suggested, \u201Csince you have so much power\u2014\u201D\r\nThe man corrected him. \u201CHonor,\u201D he said firmly. \u201CI have great honor. So will you. But you will find that that is not the same as power.\r\n\u201CLie quietly now. Since we\u2019ve entered into the topic of climate, let me give you something else. And this time I\u2019m not going to tell you the name of it, because I want to test the receiving. You should be able to perceive the name without being told. I gave away snow and sled and downhill and runners by telling them to you in advance.\u201D\r\nWithout being instructed, Jonas closed his eyes again. He felt the hands on his back again. He waited.\r\nNow it came more quickly, the feelings. This time the hands didn\u2019t become cold, but instead began to feel warm on his body. They moistened a little. The warmth spread, extending across his shoulders, up his neck, onto the side of his face. He could feel it through his clothed parts, too: a pleasant, all-over sensation; and when he licked his lips this time, the air was hot and heavy.\r\nHe didn\u2019t move. There was no sled. His posture didn\u2019t change. He was simply alone someplace, out of doors, lying down, and the warmth came from far above. It was not as exciting as the ride through the snowy air; but it was pleasurable and comforting.\r\nSuddenly he perceived the word for it:\r\nsunshine. He perceived that it came from the sky.\r\nThen it ended.\r\n\u201CSunshine,\u201D he said aloud, opening his eyes.\r\n\u201CGood. You did get the word. That makes my job easier. Not so much explaining.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd it came from the sky.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s right,\u201D the old man said. \u201CJust the way it used to.\u201D\r\n\u201CBefore Sameness. Before Climate Control,\u201D Jonas added.\r\nThe man laughed. \u201CYou receive well, and learn quickly. I\u2019m very pleased with you. That\u2019s enough for today, I think. We\u2019re off to a good start.\u201D\r\nThere was a question bothering Jonas. \u201CSir,\u201D he said, \u201CThe Chief Elder told me\u2014she told everyone\u2014and you told me, too, that it would be painful. So I was a little scared. But it didn\u2019t hurt at all. I really enjoyed it.\u201D He looked quizzically at the old man.\r\nThe man sighed. \u201CI started you with memories of pleasure. My previous failure gave me the wisdom to do that.\u201D He took a few deep breaths. \u201CJonas,\u201D he said, \u201Cit\r\nwillbe painful. But it need not be painful yet.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m brave. I really am.\u201D Jonas sat up a little straighter.\r\nThe old man looked at him for a moment. He smiled. \u201CI can see that,\u201D he said. \u201CWell, since you asked the question\u2014I think I have enough energy for one more transmission.\r\n\u201CLie down once more. This will be the last today.\u201D\r\nJonas obeyed cheerfully. He closed his eyes, waiting, and felt the hands again; then he felt the warmth again, the sunshine again, coming from the sky of this other consciousness that was so new to him. This time, as he lay basking in the wonderful warmth, he felt the passage of time. His real self was aware that it was only a minute or two; but his other, memory-receiving self felt hours pass in the sun. His skin began to sting. Restlessly he moved one arm, bending it, and felt a sharp pain in the crease of his inner arm at the elbow.\r\n\u201COuch,\u201D he said loudly, and shifted on the bed. \u201COwwww,\u201D he said, wincing at the shift, and even moving his mouth to speak made his face hurt.\r\nHe knew there was a word, but the pain kept him from grasping it.\r\nThen it ended. He opened his eyes, wincing with discomfort. \u201CIt hurt,\u201D he told the man, \u201Cand I couldn\u2019t get the word for it.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt was sunburn,\u201D the old man told him.\r\n\u201CIt hurt a\r\nlot,\u201D Jonas said, \u201Cbut I\u2019m glad you gave it to me. It was interesting. And now I understand better, what it meant, that there would be pain.\u201D\r\nThe man didn\u2019t respond. He sat silently for a second. Finally he said, \u201CGet up, now. It\u2019s time for you to go home.\u201D\r\nThey both walked to the center of the room. Jonas put his tunic back on. \u201CGoodbye, sir,\u201D he said. \u201CThank you for my first day.\u201D\r\nThe old man nodded to him. He looked drained, and a little sad.\r\n\u201CSir?\u201D Jonas said shyly.\r\n\u201CYes? Do you have a question?\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s just that I don\u2019t know your name. I thought you were The Receiver, but you say that now\r\nI\u2019mThe Receiver. So I don\u2019t know what to call you.\u201D\r\nThe man had sat back down in the comfortable upholstered chair. He moved his shoulders around as if to ease away an aching sensation. He seemed terribly weary.\r\n\u201CCall me The Giver,\u201D he told Jonas.",

      "Contents": "Unknown\r\nTwelve\r\n\u201CY\r\nOU SLEPT SOUNDLY, Jonas?\u201D his mother asked at the morning meal. \u201CNo dreams?\u201D\r\nJonas simply smiled and nodded, not ready to lie, not willing to tell the truth. \u201CI slept very soundly,\u201D he said.\r\n\u201CI wish this one would,\u201D his father said, leaning down from his chair to touch Gabriel\u2019s waving fist. The basket was on the floor beside him; in its corner, beside Gabriel\u2019s head, the stuffed hippo sat staring with its blank eyes.\r\n\u201CSo do I,\u201D Mother said, rolling her eyes. \u201CHe\u2019s so fretful at night.\u201D\r\nJonas had not heard the newchild during the night because as always, he\r\nhadslept soundly. But it was not true that he had no dreams.\r\nAgain and again, as he slept, he had slid down that snow-covered hill. Always, in the dream, it seemed as if there were a destination: a\r\nsomething\u2014he could not grasp what\u2014that lay beyond the place where the thickness of snow brought the sled to a stop.\r\nHe was left, upon awakening, with the feeling that he wanted, even somehow needed, to reach the something that waited in the distance. The feeling that it was good. That it was welcoming. That it was significant.\r\nBut he did not know how to get there.\r\nHe tried to shed the leftover dream, gathering his schoolwork and preparing for the day.\r\nSchool seemed a little different today. The classes were the same: language and communications; commerce and industry; science and technology; civil procedures and government. But during the breaks for recreation periods and the midday meal, the other new Twelves were abuzz with descriptions of their first day of training. All of them talked at once, interrupting each other, hastily making the required apology for interrupting, then forgetting again in the excitement of describing the new experiences.\r\nJonas listened. He was very aware of his own admonition not to discuss his training. But it would have been impossible, anyway. There was no way to describe to his friends what he had experienced there in the Annex room. How could you describe a sled without describing a hill and snow; and how could you describe a hill and snow to someone who had never felt height or wind or that feathery, magical cold?\r\nEven trained for years as they all had been in precision of language, what words could you use which would give another the experience of sunshine?\r\nSo it was easy for Jonas to be still and to listen.\r\nAfter school hours he rode again beside Fiona to the House of the Old.\r\n\u201CI looked for you yesterday,\u201D she told him, \u201Cso we could ride home together. Your bike was still there, and I waited for a little while. But it was getting late, so I went on home.\u201D\r\n\u201CI apologize for making you wait,\u201D Jonas said.\r\n\u201CI accept your apology,\u201D she replied automatically.\r\n\u201CI stayed a little longer than I expected,\u201D Jonas explained.\r\nShe pedaled forward silently, and he knew that she expected him to tell her why. She expected him to describe his first day of training. But to ask would have fallen into the category of rudeness.\r\n\u201CYou\u2019ve been doing so many volunteer hours with the Old,\u201D Jonas said, changing the subject. \u201CThere won\u2019t be much that you don\u2019t already know.\u201D\r\n\u201COh, there\u2019s lots to learn,\u201D Fiona replied. \u201CThere\u2019s administrative work, and the dietary rules, and punishment for disobedience\u2014did you know that they use a discipline wand on the Old, the same as for small children? And there\u2019s occupational therapy, and recreational activities, and medications, and\u2014\u201D\r\nThey reached the building and braked their bikes.\r\n\u201CI really think I\u2019ll like it better than school,\u201D Fiona confessed.\r\n\u201CMe too,\u201D Jonas agreed, wheeling his bike into its place.\r\nShe waited for a second, as if, again, she expected him to go on. Then she looked at her watch, waved, and hurried toward the entrance.\r\nJonas stood for a moment beside his bike, startled. It had happened again: the thing that he thought of now as \u201Cseeing beyond.\u201D This time it had been Fiona who had undergone that fleeting indescribable change. As he looked up and toward her going through the door, it happened; she changed. Actually, Jonas thought, trying to recreate it in his mind, it wasn\u2019t Fiona in her entirety. It seemed to be just her hair. And just for that flickering instant.\r\nHe ran through it in his mind. It was clearly beginning to happen more often. First, the apple a few weeks before. The next time had been the faces in the audience at the Auditorium, just two days ago. Now, today, Fiona\u2019s hair.\r\nFrowning, Jonas walked toward the Annex. I will ask The Giver, he decided.\r\nThe old man looked up, smiling, when Jonas entered the room. He was already seated beside the bed, and he seemed more energetic today, slightly renewed, and glad to see Jonas.\r\n\u201CWelcome,\u201D he said. \u201CWe must get started. You\u2019re one minute late.\u201D\r\n\u201CI apologi\u2014\u201D Jonas began, and then stopped, flustered, remembering there were to be no apologies.\r\nHe removed his tunic and went to the bed. \u201CI\u2019m one minute late because something happened,\u201D he explained. \u201CAnd I\u2019d like to ask you about it, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou may ask me anything.\u201D\r\nJonas tried to sort it out in his mind so that he could explain it clearly. \u201CI think it\u2019s what you call seeing-beyond,\u201D he said.\r\nThe Giver nodded. \u201CDescribe it,\u201D he said.\r\nJonas told him about the experience with the apple. Then the moment on the stage, when he had looked out and seen the same phenomenon in the faces of the crowd.\r\n\u201CThen today, just now, outside, it happened with my friend Fiona. She herself didn\u2019t change, exactly. But something about her changed for a second. Her hair looked different; but not in its shape, not in its length. I can\u2019t quite\u2014\u201D Jonas paused, frustrated by his inability to grasp and describe exactly what\r\nhadoccurred.\r\nFinally he simply said, \u201CIt changed. I don\u2019t know how, or why.\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s why I was one minute late,\u201D he concluded, and looked questioningly at The Giver.\r\nTo his surprise, the old man asked him a question which seemed unrelated to the seeing-beyond. \u201CWhen I gave you the memory yesterday, the first one, the ride on the sled, did you look around?\u201D\r\nJonas nodded. \u201CYes,\u201D he said, \u201Cbut the stuff\u2014I mean the snow\u2014in the air made it hard to see anything.\u201D\r\n\u201CDid you look at the sled?\u201D\r\nJonas thought back. \u201CNo. I only felt it under me. I dreamed of it last night, too. But I don\u2019t remember\r\nseeingthe sled in my dream, either. Just feeling it.\u201D\r\nThe Giver seemed to be thinking.\r\n\u201CWhen I was observing you, before the selection, I perceived that you probably had the capacity, and what you describe confirms that. It happened somewhat differently to me,\u201D The Giver told him. \u201CWhen I was just your age\u2014about to become the new Receiver\u2014I began to experience it, though it took a different form. With me it was .\u00A0.\u00A0. well, I won\u2019t describe that now; you wouldn\u2019t understand it yet.\r\n\u201CBut I think I can guess how it\u2019s happening with you. Let me just make a little test, to confirm my guess. Lie down.\u201D\r\nJonas lay on the bed again with his hands at his sides. He felt comfortable here now. He closed his eyes and waited for the familiar feel of The Giver\u2019s hands on his back.\r\nBut it didn\u2019t come. Instead, The Giver instructed him, \u201CCall back the memory of the ride on the sled. Just the\r\nbeginningof it, where you\u2019re at the top of the hill, before the slide starts. And this time, look down at the sled.\u201D\r\nJonas was puzzled. He opened his eyes. \u201CExcuse me,\u201D he asked politely, \u201Cbut don\u2019t\r\nyouhave to give me the memory?\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s your memory, now. It\u2019s not mine to experience any longer. I gave it away.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut how can I call it back?\u201D\r\n\u201CYou can remember last year, or the year that you were a Seven, or a Five, can\u2019t you?\u201D\r\n\u201COf course.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s much the same. Everyone in the community has one-generation memories like those. But now you will be able to go back farther. Try. Just concentrate.\u201D\r\nJonas closed his eyes again. He took a deep breath and sought the sled and the hill and the snow in his consciousness.\r\nThere they were, with no effort. He was again sitting in that whirling world of snowflakes, atop the hill.\r\nJonas grinned with delight, and blew his own steamy breath into view. Then, as he had been instructed, he looked down. He saw his own hands, furred again with snow, holding the rope. He saw his legs, and moved them aside for a glimpse of the sled beneath.\r\nDumbfounded, he stared at it. This time it was not a fleeting impression. This time the sled had\u2014and continued to have, as he blinked, and stared at it again\u2014that same mysterious quality that the apple had had so briefly. And Fiona\u2019s hair. The sled did not change. It simply was\u2014whatever the thing was.\r\nJonas opened his eyes and was still on the bed. The Giver was watching him curiously.\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D Jonas said slowly. \u201CI saw it, in the sled.\u201D\r\n\u201CLet me try one more thing. Look over there, to the bookcase. Do you see the very top row of books, the ones behind the table, on the top shelf?\u201D\r\nJonas sought them with his eyes. He stared at them, and they changed. But the change was fleeting. It slipped away the next instant.\r\n\u201CIt happened,\u201D Jonas said. \u201CIt happened to the books, but it went away again.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m right, then,\u201D The Giver said. \u201CYou\u2019re beginning to see the color red.\u201D\r\n\u201CThe what?\u201D\r\nThe Giver sighed. \u201CHow to explain this? Once, back in the time of the memories, everything had a shape and size, the way things still do, but they also had a quality called\r\ncolor.\r\n\u201CThere were a lot of colors, and one of them was called red. That\u2019s the one you are starting to see. Your friend Fiona has red hair\u2014quite distinctive, actually; I\u2019ve noticed it before. When you mentioned Fiona\u2019s hair, it was the clue that told me you were probably beginning to see the color red.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd the faces of people? The ones I saw at the Ceremony?\u201D\r\nThe Giver shook his head. \u201CNo, flesh isn\u2019t red. But it has red tones in it. There was a time, actually\u2014you\u2019ll see this in the memories later\u2014when flesh was many different colors. That was before we went to Sameness. Today flesh is all the same, and what you saw was the red tones. Probably when you saw the faces take on color it wasn\u2019t as deep or vibrant as the apple, or your friend\u2019s hair.\u201D\r\nThe Giver chuckled, suddenly. \u201CWe\u2019ve never completely mastered Sameness. I suppose the genetic scientists are still hard at work trying to work the kinks out. Hair like Fiona\u2019s must drive them crazy.\u201D\r\nJonas listened, trying hard to comprehend. \u201CAnd the sled?\u201D he said. \u201CIt had that same thing: the color red. But it didn\u2019t\r\nchange,Giver. It just\r\nwas.\u201D\r\n\u201CBecause it\u2019s a memory from the time when color\r\nwas.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt was so\u2014oh, I wish language were more precise! The red was so beautiful!\u201D\r\nThe Giver nodded. \u201CIt is.\u201D\r\n\u201CDo you see it all the time?\u201D\r\n\u201CI see all of them. All the colors.\u201D\r\n\u201CWill I?\u201D\r\n\u201COf course. When you receive the memories. You have the capacity to see beyond. You\u2019ll gain wisdom, then, along with colors. And lots more.\u201D\r\nJonas wasn\u2019t interested, just then, in wisdom. It was the colors that fascinated him. \u201CWhy can\u2019t everyone see them? Why did colors disappear?\u201D\r\nThe Giver shrugged. \u201COur people made that choice, the choice to go to Sameness. Before my time, before the previous time, back and back and back. We relinquished color when we relinquished sunshine and did away with differences.\u201D He thought for a moment. \u201CWe gained control of many things. But we had to let go of others.\u201D\r\n\u201CWe shouldn\u2019t have!\u201D Jonas said fiercely.\r\nThe Giver looked startled at the certainty of Jonas\u2019s reaction. Then he smiled wryly. \u201CYou\u2019ve come very quickly to that conclusion,\u201D he said. \u201CIt took me many years. Maybe your wisdom will come much more quickly than mine.\u201D\r\nHe glanced at the wall clock. \u201CLie back down, now. We have so much to do.\u201D\r\n\u201CGiver,\u201D Jonas asked as he arranged himself again on the bed, \u201Chow did it happen to you when you were becoming The Receiver? You said that the seeing-beyond happened to you, but not the same way.\u201D\r\nThe hands came to his back. \u201CAnother day,\u201D The Giver said gently. \u201CI\u2019ll tell you another day. Now we must work. And I\u2019ve thought of a way to help you with the concept of color.\r\n\u201CClose your eyes and be still, now. I\u2019m going to give you a memory of a rainbow.\u201D",

Jonas learned, through the memories, the names of colors; and now he began to see them all, in his ordinary life (though he knew it was ordinary no longer, and would never be again). But they didn\u2019t last. There would be a glimpse of green\u2014the landscaped lawn around the Central Plaza; a bush on the riverbank. The bright orange of pumpkins being trucked in from the agricultural fields beyond the community boundary\u2014seen in an instant, the flash of brilliant color, but gone again, returning to their flat and hueless shade.\r\nThe Giver told him that it would be a very long time before he had the colors to keep.\r\n\u201CBut I want them!\u201D Jonas said angrily. \u201CIt isn\u2019t fair that nothing has color!\u201D\r\n\u201CNot fair?\u201D The Giver looked at Jonas curiously. \u201CExplain what you mean.\u201D\r\n\u201CWell .\u00A0.\u00A0.\u201D Jonas had to stop and think it through. \u201CIf everything\u2019s the same, then there aren\u2019t any choices! I want to wake up in the morning and\r\ndecidethings! A blue tunic, or a red one?\u201D\r\nHe looked down at himself, at the colorless fabric of his clothing. \u201CBut it\u2019s all the same, always.\u201D\r\nThen he laughed a little. \u201CI know it\u2019s not important, what you wear. It doesn\u2019t matter. But\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s the choosing that\u2019s important, isn\u2019t it?\u201D The Giver asked him.\r\nJonas nodded. \u201CMy little brother\u2014\u201D he began, and then corrected himself. \u201CNo, that\u2019s inaccurate. He\u2019s not my brother, not really. But this newchild that my family takes care of\u2014his name\u2019s Gabriel?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes, I know about Gabriel.\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, he\u2019s right at the age where he\u2019s learning so much. He grabs toys when we hold them in front of him\u2014my father says he\u2019s learning small-muscle control. And he\u2019s really cute.\u201D\r\nThe Giver nodded.\r\n\u201CBut now that I can see colors, at least sometimes, I was just thinking: what if we could hold up things that were bright red, or bright yellow, and he could\r\nchoose?Instead of the Sameness.\u201D\r\n\u201CHe might make wrong choices.\u201D\r\n\u201COh.\u201D Jonas was silent for a minute. \u201COh, I see what you mean. It wouldn\u2019t matter for a newchild\u2019s toy. But later it\r\ndoesmatter, doesn\u2019t it? We don\u2019t dare to let people make choices of their own.\u201D\r\n\u201CNot safe?\u201D The Giver suggested.\r\n\u201CDefinitely not safe,\u201D Jonas said with certainty. \u201CWhat if they were allowed to choose their own mate? And chose\r\nwrong?\r\n\u201COr what if,\u201D he went on, almost laughing at the absurdity, \u201Cthey chose their own\r\njobs?\u201D\r\n\u201CFrightening, isn\u2019t it?\u201D The Giver said.\r\nJonas chuckled. \u201CVery frightening. I can\u2019t even imagine it. We really have to protect people from wrong choices.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s safer.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D Jonas agreed. \u201CMuch safer.\u201D\r\nBut when the conversation turned to other things, Jonas was left, still, with a feeling of frustration that he didn\u2019t understand.\r\nHe found that he was often angry, now: irrationally angry at his groupmates, that they were satisfied with their lives which had none of the vibrance his own was taking on. And he was angry at himself, that he could not change that for them.\r\nHe tried. Without asking permission from The Giver, because he feared\u2014or knew\u2014that it would be denied, he tried to give his new awareness to his friends.\r\n\u201CAsher,\u201D Jonas said one morning, \u201Clook at those flowers very carefully.\u201D They were standing beside a bed of geraniums planted near the Hall of Open Records. He put his hands on Asher\u2019s shoulders, and concentrated on the red of the petals, trying to hold it as long as he could, and trying at the same time to transmit the awareness of red to his friend.\r\n\u201CWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201D Asher asked uneasily. \u201CIs something wrong?\u201D He moved away from Jonas\u2019s hands. It was extremely rude for one citizen to touch another outside of family units.\r\n\u201CNo, nothing. I thought for a minute that they were wilting, and we should let the Gardening Crew know they needed more watering.\u201D Jonas sighed, and turned away.\r\nOne evening he came home from his training weighted with new knowledge. The Giver had chosen a startling and disturbing memory that day. Under the touch of his hands, Jonas had found himself suddenly in a place that was completely alien: hot and windswept under a vast blue sky. There were tufts of sparse grass, a few bushes and rocks, and nearby he could see an area of thicker vegetation: broad, low trees outlined against the sky. He could hear noises: the sharp crack of weapons\u2014he perceived the word\r\nguns\u2014and then shouts, and an immense crashing thud as something fell, tearing branches from the trees.\r\nHe heard voices calling to one another. Peering from the place where he stood hidden behind some shrubbery, he was reminded of what The Giver had told him, that there had been a time when flesh had different colors. Two of these men had dark brown skin; the others were light. Going closer, he watched them hack the tusks from a motionless elephant on the ground and haul them away, spattered with blood. He felt himself overwhelmed with a new perception of the color he knew as red.\r\nThen the men were gone, speeding toward the horizon in a vehicle that spit pebbles from its whirling tires. One hit his forehead and stung him there. But the memory continued, though Jonas ached now for it to end.\r\nNow he saw another elephant emerge from the place where it had stood hidden in the trees. Very slowly it walked to the mutilated body and looked down. With its sinuous trunk it stroked the huge corpse; then it reached up, broke some leafy branches with a snap, and draped them over the mass of torn thick flesh.\r\nFinally it tilted its massive head, raised its trunk, and roared into the empty landscape. Jonas had never heard such a sound. It was a sound of rage and grief and it seemed never to end.\r\nHe could still hear it when he opened his eyes and lay anguished on the bed where he received the memories. It continued to roar into his consciousness as he pedaled slowly home.\r\n\u201CLily,\u201D he asked that evening when his sister took her comfort object, the stuffed elephant, from the shelf, \u201Cdid you know that once there really were elephants? Live ones?\u201D\r\nShe glanced down at the ragged comfort object and grinned. \u201CRight,\u201D she said, skeptically. \u201CSure, Jonas.\u201D\r\nJonas went and sat beside them while his father untied Lily\u2019s hair ribbons and combed her hair. He placed one hand on each of their shoulders. With all of his being he tried to give each of them a piece of the memory: not of the tortured cry of the elephant, but of the\r\nbeingof the elephant, of the towering, immense creature and the meticulous touch with which it had tended its friend at the end.\r\nBut his father had continued to comb Lily\u2019s long hair, and Lily, impatient, had finally wiggled under her brother\u2019s touch. \u201CJonas,\u201D she said, \u201Cyou\u2019re\r\nhurtingme with your hand.\u201D\r\n\u201CI apologize for hurting you, Lily,\u201D Jonas mumbled, and took his hand away.\r\n\u201C\u2019Cept your apology,\u201D Lily responded indifferently, stroking the lifeless elephant.\r\n\u201CGiver,\u201D Jonas asked once, as they prepared for the day\u2019s work, \u201Cdon\u2019t you have a spouse? Aren\u2019t you allowed to apply for one?\u201D Although he was exempted from the rules against rudeness, he was aware that this was a rude question. But The Giver had encouraged all of his questions, not seeming to be embarrassed or offended by even the most personal.\r\nThe Giver chuckled. \u201CNo, there\u2019s no rule against it. And I did have a spouse. You\u2019re forgetting how old I am, Jonas. My former spouse lives now with the Childless Adults.\u201D\r\n\u201COh, of course.\u201D Jonas\r\nhadforgotten The Giver\u2019s obvious age. When adults of the community became older, their lives became different. They were no longer needed to create family units. Jonas\u2019s own parents, when he and Lily were grown, would go to live with the Childless Adults.\r\n\u201CYou\u2019ll be able to apply for a spouse, Jonas, if you want to. I\u2019ll warn you, though, that it will be difficult. Your living arrangements will have to be different from those of most family units, because the books are forbidden to citizens. You and I are the only ones with access to the books.\u201D\r\nJonas glanced around at the astonishing array of volumes. From time to time, now, he could see their colors. With their hours together, his and The Giver\u2019s, consumed by conversation and by the transmission of memories, Jonas had not yet opened any of the books. But he read the titles here and there, and knew that they contained all of the knowledge of centuries, and that one day they would belong to him.\r\n\u201CSo if I have a spouse, and maybe children, I will have to hide the books from them?\u201D\r\nThe Giver nodded. \u201CI wasn\u2019t permitted to share the books with my spouse, that\u2019s correct. And there are other difficulties, too. You remember the rule that says the new Receiver can\u2019t talk about his training?\u201D\r\nJonas nodded. Of course he remembered. It had turned out, by far, to be the most frustrating of the rules he was required to obey.\r\n\u201CWhen you become the official Receiver, when we\u2019re finished here, you\u2019ll be given a whole new set of rules. Those are the rules that I obey. And it won\u2019t surprise you that I am forbidden to talk about my work to anyone except the new Receiver. That\u2019s you, of course.\r\n\u201CSo there will be a whole part of your life which you won\u2019t be able to share with a family. It\u2019s hard, Jonas. It was hard for me.\r\n\u201CYou do understand, don\u2019t you, that this\r\nismy life? The memories?\u201D\r\nJonas nodded again, but he was puzzled. Didn\u2019t life consist of the things you did each day? There wasn\u2019t anything else, really. \u201CI\u2019ve seen you taking walks,\u201D he said.\r\nThe Giver sighed. \u201CI walk. I eat at mealtime. And when I am called by the Committee of Elders, I appear before them, to give them counsel and advice.\u201D\r\n\u201CDo you advise them often?\u201D Jonas was a little frightened at the thought that one day he would be the one to advise the ruling body.\r\nBut The Giver said no. \u201CRarely. Only when they are faced with something that they have not experienced before. Then they call upon me to use the memories and advise them. But it very seldom happens. Sometimes I wish they\u2019d ask for my wisdom more often\u2014there are so many things I could tell them; things I wish they would change. But they don\u2019t want change. Life here is so orderly, so predictable\u2014so painless. It\u2019s what they\u2019ve chosen.\u201D\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know why they even\r\nneeda Receiver, then, if they never call upon him,\u201D Jonas commented.\r\n\u201CThey need me. And you,\u201D The Giver said, but didn\u2019t explain. \u201CThey were reminded of that ten years ago.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat happened ten years ago?\u201D Jonas asked. \u201COh, I know. You tried to train a successor and it failed. Why? Why did that remind them?\u201D\r\nThe Giver smiled grimly. \u201CWhen the new Receiver failed, the memories that she had received were released. They didn\u2019t come back to me. They went .\u00A0.\u00A0.\u201D\r\nHe paused, and seemed to be struggling with the concept. \u201CI don\u2019t know, exactly. They went to the place where memories once existed before Receivers were created. Someplace out\r\nthere\u2014\u201D He gestured vaguely with his arm. \u201CAnd then the people had access to them. Apparently that\u2019s the way it was, once. Everyone had access to memories.\r\n\u201CIt was chaos,\u201D he said. \u201CThey really suffered for a while. Finally it subsided as the memories were assimilated. But it certainly made them aware of how they need a Receiver to contain all that pain. And knowledge.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut you have to suffer like that all the time,\u201D Jonas pointed out.\r\nThe Giver nodded. \u201CAnd you will. It\u2019s my life. It will be yours.\u201D\r\nJonas thought about it, about what it would be like for him. \u201CAlong with walking and eating and\u2014\u201D He looked around the walls of books. \u201CReading? That\u2019s it?\u201D\r\nThe Giver shook his head. \u201CThose are simply the things that I\r\ndo. My\r\nlifeis here.\u201D\r\n\u201CIn this room?\u201D\r\nThe Giver shook his head. He put his hands to his own face, to his chest. \u201CNo. Here, in my being. Where the memories are.\u201D\r\n\u201CMy Instructors in science and technology have taught us about how the brain works,\u201D Jonas told him eagerly. \u201CIt\u2019s full of electrical impulses. It\u2019s like a computer. If you stimulate one part of the brain with an electrode, it\u2014\u201D He stopped talking. He could see an odd look on The Giver\u2019s face.\r\n\u201CThey know nothing,\u201D The Giver said bitterly.\r\nJonas was shocked. Since the first day in the Annex room, they had together disregarded the rules about rudeness, and Jonas felt comfortable with that now. But this was different, and far beyond rude. This was a terrible accusation. What if someone had heard?\r\nHe glanced quickly at the wall speaker, terrified that the Committee might be listening as they could at any time. But, as always during their sessions together, the switch had been turned to\r\nOFF.\r\n\u201CNothing?\u201D Jonas whispered nervously. \u201CBut my instructors\u2014\u201D\r\nThe Giver flicked his hand as if brushing something aside. \u201COh, your instructors are well trained. They know their scientific facts.\r\nEveryoneis well trained for his job.\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s just that .\u00A0.\u00A0. without the memories it\u2019s all meaningless. They gave that burden to me. And to the previous Receiver. And the one before him.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd back and back and back,\u201D Jonas said, knowing the phrase that always came.\r\nThe Giver smiled, though his smile was oddly harsh. \u201CThat\u2019s right. And next it will be you. A great honor.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes, sir. They told me that at the Ceremony. The very highest honor.\u201D\r\nSome afternoons The Giver sent him away without training. Jonas knew, on days when he arrived to find The Giver hunched over, rocking his body slightly back and forth, his face pale, that he would be sent away.\r\n\u201CGo,\u201D The Giver would tell him tensely. \u201CI\u2019m in pain today. Come back tomorrow.\u201D\r\nOn those days, worried and disappointed, Jonas would walk alone beside the river. The paths were empty of people except for the few Delivery Crews and Landscape Workers here and there. Small children were all at the Childcare Center after school, and the older ones busy with volunteer hours or training.\r\nBy himself, he tested his own developing memory. He watched the landscape for glimpses of the green that he knew was embedded in the shrubbery; when it came flickering into his consciousness, he focused upon it, keeping it there, darkening it, holding it in his vision as long as possible until his head hurt and he let it fade away.\r\nHe stared at the flat, colorless sky, bringing blue from it, and remembered sunshine until finally, for an instant, he could feel warmth.\r\nHe stood at the foot of the bridge that spanned the river, the bridge that citizens were allowed to cross only on official business. Jonas had crossed it on school trips, visiting the outlying communities, and he knew that the land beyond the bridge was much the same, flat and well ordered, with fields for agriculture. The other communities he had seen on visits were essentially the same as his own, the only differences were slightly altered styles of dwellings, slightly different schedules in the schools.\r\nHe wondered what lay in the far distance where he had never gone. The land didn\u2019t\r\nendbeyond those nearby communities. Were there\r\nhillsElsewhere? Were there vast wind-torn areas like the place he had seen in memory, the place where the elephant died?\r\n\u201CGiver,\u201D he asked one afternoon following a day when he had been sent away, \u201Cwhat causes you pain?\u201D\r\nWhen The Giver was silent, Jonas continued. \u201CThe Chief Elder told me, at the beginning, that the receiving of memory causes terrible pain. And you described for me that the failure of the last new Receiver released painful memories to the community.\r\n\u201CBut I haven\u2019t suffered, Giver. Not really.\u201D Jonas smiled. \u201COh, I remember the sunburn you gave me on the very first day. But that wasn\u2019t so terrible. What is it that makes you suffer so much? If you gave some of it to me, maybe your pain would be less.\u201D\r\nThe Giver nodded. \u201CLie down,\u201D he said. \u201CIt\u2019s time, I suppose. I can\u2019t shield you forever. You\u2019ll have to take it all on eventually.\r\n\u201CLet me think,\u201D he went on, when Jonas was on the bed, waiting, a little fearful.\r\n\u201CAll right,\u201D The Giver said after a moment, \u201CI\u2019ve decided. We\u2019ll start with something familiar. Let\u2019s go once again to a hill, and a sled.\u201D\r\nHe placed his hands on Jonas\u2019s back.",

      "Contents": "Unknown\r\nFourteen\r\nI\r\nT WAS MUCHthe same, this memory, though the hill seemed to be a different one, steeper, and the snow was not falling as thickly as it had before.\r\nIt was colder, also, Jonas perceived. He could see, as he sat waiting at the top of the hill, that the snow beneath the sled was not thick and soft as it had been before, but hard, and coated with bluish ice.\r\nThe sled moved forward, and Jonas grinned with delight, looking forward to the breathtaking slide down through the invigorating air.\r\nBut the runners, this time, couldn\u2019t slice through the frozen expanse as they had on the other, snow-cushioned hill. They skittered sideways and the sled gathered speed. Jonas pulled at the rope, trying to steer, but the steepness and speed took control from his hands and he was no longer enjoying the feeling of freedom but instead, terrified, was at the mercy of the wild acceleration downward over the ice.\r\nSideways, spinning, the sled hit a bump in the hill and Jonas was jarred loose and thrown violently into the air. He fell with his leg twisted under him, and could hear the crack of bone. His face scraped along jagged edges of ice and when he came, at last, to a stop, he lay shocked and still, feeling nothing at first but fear.\r\nThen, the first wave of pain. He gasped. It was as if a hatchet lay lodged in his leg, slicing through each nerve with a hot blade. In his agony he perceived the word \u201Cfire\u201D and felt flames licking at the torn bone and flesh. He tried to move, and could not. The pain grew.\r\nHe screamed. There was no answer.\r\nSobbing, he turned his head and vomited onto the frozen snow. Blood dripped from his face into the vomit.\r\n\u201CNooooo!\u201D he cried, and the sound disappeared into the empty landscape, into the wind.\r\nThen, suddenly, he was in the Annex room again, writhing on the bed. His face was wet with tears.\r\nAble to move now, he rocked his own body back and forth, breathing deeply to release the remembered pain.\r\nHe sat, and looked at his own leg, where it lay straight on the bed, unbroken. The brutal slice of pain was gone. But the leg ached horribly, still, and his face felt raw.\r\n\u201CMay I have relief-of-pain, please?\u201D he begged. It was always provided in his everyday life for the bruises and wounds, for a mashed finger, a stomach ache, a skinned knee from a fall from a bike. There was always a daub of anesthetic ointment, or a pill; or in severe instances, an injection that brought complete and instantaneous deliverance.\r\nBut The Giver said no, and looked away.\r\nLimping, Jonas walked home, pushing his bicycle, that evening. The sunburn pain had been so small, in comparison, and had not stayed with him. But this ache lingered.\r\nIt was not unendurable, as the pain on the hill had been. Jonas tried to be brave. He remembered that the Chief Elder had said he was brave.\r\n\u201CIs something wrong, Jonas?\u201D his father asked at the evening meal. \u201CYou\u2019re so quiet tonight. Aren\u2019t you feeling well? Would you like some medication?\u201D\r\nBut Jonas remembered the rules. No medication for anything related to his training.\r\nAnd no discussion of his training. At the time for sharing-of-feelings, he simply said that he felt tired, that his school lessons had been unusually demanding that day.\r\nHe went to his sleepingroom early, and from behind the closed door he could hear his parents and sister laughing as they gave Gabriel his evening bath.\r\nThey have never known pain,he thought. The realization made him feel desperately lonely, and he rubbed his throbbing leg. He eventually slept. Again and again he dreamed of the anguish and the isolation on the forsaken hill.\r\nThe daily training continued, and now it always included pain. The agony of the fractured leg began to seem no more than a mild discomfort as The Giver led Jonas firmly, little by little, into the deep and terrible suffering of the past. Each time, in his kindness, The Giver ended the afternoon with a color-filled memory of pleasure: a brisk sail on a blue-green lake; a meadow dotted with yellow wildflowers; an orange sunset behind mountains.\r\nIt was not enough to assuage the pain that Jonas was beginning, now, to know.\r\n\u201C\r\nWhy?\u201D Jonas asked him after he had received a torturous memory in which he had been neglected and unfed; the hunger had caused excruciating spasms in his empty, distended stomach. He lay on the bed, aching. \u201CWhy do you and I have to hold these memories?\u201D\r\n\u201CIt gives us wisdom,\u201D The Giver replied. \u201CWithout wisdom I could not fulfill my function of advising the Committee of Elders when they call upon me.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut what wisdom do you get from hunger?\u201D Jonas groaned. His stomach still hurt, though the memory had ended.\r\n\u201CSome years ago,\u201D The Giver told him, \u201Cbefore your birth, a lot of citizens petitioned the Committee of Elders. They wanted to increase the rate of births. They wanted each Birthmother to be assigned four births instead of three, so that the population would increase and there would be more Laborers available.\u201D\r\nJonas nodded, listening. \u201CThat makes sense.\u201D\r\n\u201CThe idea was that certain family units could accommodate an additional child.\u201D\r\nJonas nodded again. \u201CMine could,\u201D he pointed out. \u201CWe have Gabriel this year, and it\u2019s fun, having a third child.\u201D\r\n\u201CThe Committee of Elders sought my advice,\u201D The Giver said. \u201CIt made sense to them, too, but it was a new idea, and they came to me for wisdom.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd you used your memories?\u201D\r\nThe Giver said yes. \u201CAnd the strongest memory that came was hunger. It came from many generations back.\r\nCenturiesback. The population had gotten so big that hunger was everywhere. Excruciating hunger and starvation. It was followed by warfare.\u201D\r\nWarfare? It was a concept Jonas did not know. But hunger was familiar to him now. Unconsciously he rubbed his own abdomen, recalling the pain of its unfulfilled needs. \u201CSo you described that to them?\u201D\r\n\u201CThey don\u2019t want to hear about pain. They just seek the advice. I simply advised them against increasing the population.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut you said that that was before my birth. They hardly ever come to you for advice. Only when they\u2014what was it you said? When they have a problem they\u2019ve never faced before. When did it happen last?\u201D\r\n\u201CDo you remember the day when the plane flew over the community?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes. I was scared.\u201D\r\n\u201CSo were they. They prepared to shoot it down. But they sought my advice. I told them to wait.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut how did you know? How did you know the pilot was lost?\u201D\r\n\u201CI didn\u2019t. I used my wisdom, from the memories. I knew that there had been times in the past\u2014terrible times\u2014when people had destroyed others in haste, in fear, and had brought about their own destruction.\u201D\r\nJonas realized something. \u201CThat means,\u201D he said slowly, \u201Cthat you have memories of destruction. And you have to give them to me, too, because I have to get the wisdom.\u201D\r\nThe Giver nodded.\r\n\u201CBut it will hurt,\u201D Jonas said. It wasn\u2019t a question.\r\n\u201CIt will hurt terribly,\u201D The Giver agreed.\r\n\u201CBut why can\u2019t\r\neveryonehave the memories? I think it would seem a little easier if the memories were shared. You and I wouldn\u2019t have to bear so much by ourselves, if everybody took a part.\u201D\r\nThe Giver sighed. \u201CYou\u2019re right,\u201D he said. \u201CBut then everyone would be burdened and pained. They don\u2019t want that. And that\u2019s the real reason The Receiver is so vital to them, and so honored. They selected me\u2014and you\u2014to lift that burden from themselves.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhen did they decide that?\u201D Jonas asked angrily. \u201CIt wasn\u2019t fair. Let\u2019s change it!\u201D\r\n\u201CHow do you suggest we do that? I\u2019ve never been able to think of a way, and I\u2019m supposed to be the one with all the wisdom.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut there are two of us now,\u201D Jonas said eagerly. \u201C\r\nTogetherwe can think of something!\u201D\r\nThe Giver watched him with a wry smile.\r\n\u201CWhy can\u2019t we just apply for a change of rules?\u201D Jonas suggested.\r\nThe Giver laughed; then Jonas, too, chuckled reluctantly.\r\n\u201CThe decision was made long before my time or yours,\u201D The Giver said, \u201Cand before the previous Receiver, and\u2014\u201D He waited.\r\n\u201CBack and back and back.\u201D Jonas repeated the familiar phrase. Sometimes it had seemed humorous to him. Sometimes it had seemed meaningful and important.\r\nNow it was ominous. It meant, he knew, that nothing could be changed.\r\nThe newchild, Gabriel, was growing, and successfully passed the tests of maturity that the Nurturers gave each month; he could sit alone, now, could reach for and grasp small play objects, and he had six teeth. During the daytime hours, Father reported, he was cheerful and seemed of normal intelligence. But he remained fretful at night, whimpering often, needing frequent attention.\r\n\u201CAfter all this extra time I\u2019ve put in with him,\u201D Father said one evening after Gabriel had been bathed and was lying, for the moment, hugging his hippo placidly in the small crib that had replaced the basket, \u201CI hope they\u2019re not going to decide to release him.\u201D\r\n\u201CMaybe it would be for the best,\u201D Mother suggested. \u201CI know you don\u2019t mind getting up with him at night. But the lack of sleep is awfully hard for me.\u201D\r\n\u201CIf they release Gabriel, can we get another newchild as a visitor?\u201D asked Lily. She was kneeling beside the crib, making funny faces at the little one, who was smiling back at her.\r\nJonas\u2019s mother rolled her eyes in dismay.\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D Father said, smiling. He ruffled Lily\u2019s hair. \u201CIt\u2019s very rare, anyway, that a newchild\u2019s status is as uncertain as Gabriel\u2019s. It probably won\u2019t happen again, for a long time.\r\n\u201CAnyway,\u201D he sighed, \u201Cthey won\u2019t make the decision for a while. Right now we\u2019re all preparing for a release we\u2019ll probably have to make very soon. There\u2019s a Birth-mother who\u2019s expecting twin males next month.\u201D\r\n\u201COh, dear,\u201D Mother said, shaking her head. \u201CIf they\u2019re identical, I hope you\u2019re not the one assigned\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CI am. I\u2019m next on the list. I\u2019ll have to select the one to be nurtured, and the one to be released. It\u2019s usually not hard, though. Usually it\u2019s just a matter of birthweight. We release the smaller of the two.\u201D\r\nJonas, listening, thought suddenly about the bridge and how, standing there, he had wondered what lay Elsewhere. Was there someone there, waiting, who would receive the tiny released twin? Would it grow up Elsewhere, not knowing, ever, that in this community lived a being who looked exactly the same?\r\nFor a moment he felt a tiny, fluttering hope that he knew was quite foolish. He hoped that it would be Larissa, waiting. Larissa, the old woman he had bathed. He remembered her sparkling eyes, her soft voice, her low chuckle. Fiona had told him recently that Larissa had been released at a wonderful ceremony.\r\nBut he knew that the Old were not given children to raise. Larissa\u2019s life Elsewhere would be quiet and serene as befit the Old; she would not welcome the responsibility of nurturing a newchild who needed feeding and care, and would likely cry at night.\r\n\u201CMother? Father?\u201D he said, the idea coming to him unexpectedly, \u201Cwhy don\u2019t we put Gabriel\u2019s crib in my room tonight? I know how to feed and comfort him, and it would let you and Father get some sleep.\u201D\r\nFather looked doubtful. \u201CYou sleep so soundly, Jonas. What if his restlessness didn\u2019t wake you?\u201D\r\nIt was Lily who answered that. \u201CIf no one goes to tend Gabriel,\u201D she pointed out, \u201Che gets very loud. He\u2019d wake\r\nallof us, if Jonas slept through it.\u201D\r\nFather laughed. \u201CYou\u2019re right, Lily-billy. All right, Jonas, let\u2019s try it, just for tonight. I\u2019ll take the night off and we\u2019ll let Mother get some sleep, too.\u201D\r\nGabriel slept soundly for the earliest part of the night. Jonas, in his bed, lay awake for a while; from time to time he raised himself on one elbow, looking over at the crib. The newchild was on his stomach, his arms relaxed beside his head, his eyes closed, and his breathing regular and undisturbed. Finally Jonas slept too.\r\nThen, as the middle hours of the night approached, the noise of Gabe\u2019s restlessness woke Jonas. The newchild was turning under his cover, flailing his arms, and beginning to whimper.\r\nJonas rose and went to him. Gently he patted Gabriel\u2019s back. Sometimes that was all it took to lull him back to sleep. But the newchild still squirmed fretfully under his hand.\r\nStill patting rhythmically, Jonas began to remember the wonderful sail that The Giver had given him not long before: a bright, breezy day on a clear turquoise lake, and above him the white sail of the boat billowing as he moved along in the brisk wind.\r\nHe was not aware of giving the memory; but suddenly he realized that it was becoming dimmer, that it was sliding through his hand into the being of the newchild. Gabriel became quiet. Startled, Jonas pulled back what was left of the memory with a burst of will. He removed his hand from the little back and stood quietly beside the crib.\r\nTo himself, he called the memory of the sail forward again. It was still there, but the sky was less blue, the gentle motion of the boat slower, the water of the lake more murky and clouded. He kept it for a while, soothing his own nervousness at what had occurred, then let it go and returned to his bed.\r\nOnce more, toward dawn, the newchild woke and cried out. Again Jonas went to him. This time he quite deliberately placed his hand firmly on Gabriel\u2019s back, and released the rest of the calming day on the lake. Again Gabriel slept.\r\nBut now Jonas lay awake, thinking. He no longer had any more than a wisp of the memory, and he felt a small lack where it had been. He could ask The Giver for another sail, he knew. A sail perhaps on ocean, next time, for Jonas had a memory of ocean, now, and knew what it was; he knew that there were sailboats there, too, in memories yet to be acquired.\r\nHe wondered, though, if he should confess to The Giver that he had given a memory away. He was not yet qualified to be a Giver himself; nor had Gabriel been selected to be a Receiver.\r\nThat he had this power frightened him. He decided not to tell.",

The Giver was rigid in his chair, his face in his hands.\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll come back tomorrow, sir,\u201D he said quickly. Then he hesitated. \u201CUnless maybe there\u2019s something I can do to help.\u201D\r\nThe Giver looked up at him, his face contorted with suffering. \u201CPlease,\u201D he gasped, \u201Ctake some of the pain.\u201D\r\nJonas helped him to his chair at the side of the bed. Then he quickly removed his tunic and lay face down. \u201CPut your hands on me,\u201D he directed, aware that in such anguish The Giver might need reminding.\r\nThe hands came, and the pain came with them and through them. Jonas braced himself and entered the memory which was torturing The Giver.\r\nHe was in a confused, noisy, foul-smelling place. It was daylight, early morning, and the air was thick with smoke that hung, yellow and brown, above the ground. Around him, everywhere, far across the expanse of what seemed to be a field, lay groaning men. A wild-eyed horse, its bridle torn and dangling, trotted frantically through the mounds of men, tossing its head, whinnying in panic. It stumbled, finally, then fell, and did not rise.\r\nJonas heard a voice next to him. \u201CWater,\u201D the voice said in a parched, croaking whisper.\r\nHe turned his head toward the voice and looked into the half-closed eyes of a boy who seemed not much older than himself. Dirt streaked the boy\u2019s face and his matted blond hair. He lay sprawled, his gray uniform glistening with wet, fresh blood.\r\nThe colors of the carnage were grotesquely bright: the crimson wetness on the rough and dusty fabric, the ripped shreds of grass, startlingly green, in the boy\u2019s yellow hair.\r\nThe boy stared at him. \u201CWater,\u201D he begged again. When he spoke, a new spurt of blood drenched the coarse cloth across his chest and sleeve.\r\nOne of Jonas\u2019s arms was immobilized with pain, and he could see through his own torn sleeve something that looked like ragged flesh and splintery bone. He tried his remaining arm and felt it move. Slowly he reached to his side, felt the metal container there, and removed its cap, stopping the small motion of his hand now and then to wait for the surging pain to ease. Finally, when the container was open, he extended his arm slowly across the blood-soaked earth, inch by inch, and held it to the lips of the boy. Water trickled into the imploring mouth and down the grimy chin.\r\nThe boy sighed. His head fell back, his lower jaw dropping as if he had been surprised by something. A dull blankness slid slowly across his eyes. He was silent.\r\nBut the noise continued all around: the cries of the wounded men, the cries begging for water and for Mother and for death. Horses lying on the ground shrieked, raised their heads, and stabbed randomly toward the sky with their hooves.\r\nFrom the distance, Jonas could hear the thud of cannons. Overwhelmed by pain, he lay there in the fearsome stench for hours, listened to the men and animals die, and learned what warfare meant.\r\nFinally, when he knew that he could bear it no longer and would welcome death himself, he opened his eyes and was once again on the bed.\r\nThe Giver looked away, as if he could not bear to see what he had done to Jonas. \u201CForgive me,\u201D he said.",

      "Contents": "Unknown\r\nSixteen\r\nJ\r\nONAS DID NOTwant to go back. He didn\u2019t want the memories, didn\u2019t want the honor, didn\u2019t want the wisdom, didn\u2019t want the pain. He wanted his childhood again, his scraped knees and ball games. He sat in his dwelling alone, watching through the window, seeing children at play, citizens bicycling home from uneventful days at work, ordinary lives free of anguish because he had been selected, as others before him had, to bear their burden.\r\nBut the choice was not his. He returned each day to the Annex room.\r\nThe Giver was gentle with him for many days following the terrible shared memory of war.\r\n\u201CThere are so many good memories,\u201D The Giver reminded Jonas. And it was true. By now Jonas had experienced countless bits of happiness, things he had never known of before.\r\nHe had seen a birthday party, with one child singled out and celebrated on his day, so that now he understood the joy of being an individual, special and unique and proud.\r\nHe had visited museums and seen paintings filled with all the colors he could now recognize and name.\r\nIn one ecstatic memory he had ridden a gleaming brown horse across a field that smelled of damp grass, and had dismounted beside a small stream from which both he and the horse drank cold, clear water. Now he understood about animals; and in the moment that the horse turned from the stream and nudged Jonas\u2019s shoulder affectionately with its head, he perceived the bonds between animal and human.\r\nHe had walked through woods, and sat at night beside a campfire. Although he had through the memories learned about the pain of loss and loneliness, now he gained, too, an understanding of solitude and its joy.\r\n\u201CWhat is your favorite?\u201D Jonas asked The Giver. \u201CYou don\u2019t have to give it away yet,\u201D he added quickly. \u201CJust tell me about it, so I can look forward to it, because I\u2019ll have to receive it when your job is done.\u201D\r\nThe Giver smiled. \u201CLie down,\u201D he said. \u201CI\u2019m happy to give it to you.\u201D\r\nJonas felt the joy of it as soon as the memory began. Sometimes it took a while for him to get his bearings, to find his place. But this time he fit right in and felt the happiness that pervaded the memory.\r\nHe was in a room filled with people, and it was warm, with firelight glowing on a hearth. He could see through a window that outside it was night, and snowing. There were colored lights: red and green and yellow, twinkling from a tree which was, oddly, inside the room. On a table, lighted candles stood in a polished golden holder and cast a soft, flickering glow. He could smell things cooking, and he heard soft laughter. A golden-haired dog lay sleeping on the floor.\r\nOn the floor there were packages wrapped in brightly colored paper and tied with gleaming ribbons. As Jonas watched, a small child began to pick up the packages and pass them around the room: to other children, to adults who were obviously parents, and to an older, quiet couple, man and woman, who sat smiling together on a couch.\r\nWhile Jonas watched, the people began one by one to untie the ribbons on the packages, to unwrap the bright papers, open the boxes and reveal toys and clothing and books. There were cries of delight. They hugged one another.\r\nThe small child went and sat on the lap of the old woman, and she rocked him and rubbed her cheek against his.\r\nJonas opened his eyes and lay contentedly on the bed, still luxuriating in the warm and comforting memory. It had all been there, all the things he had learned to treasure.\r\n\u201CWhat did you perceive?\u201D The Giver asked.\r\n\u201CWarmth,\u201D Jonas replied, \u201Cand happiness. And\u2014let me think.\r\nFamily. That it was a celebration of some sort, a holiday. And something else\u2014I can\u2019t quite get the word for it.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt will come to you.\u201D\r\n\u201CWho were the old people? Why were they there?\u201D It had puzzled Jonas, seeing them in the room. The Old of the community did not ever leave their special place, the House of the Old, where they were so well cared for and respected.\r\n\u201CThey were called Grandparents.\u201D\r\n\u201CGrand parents?\u201D\r\n\u201CGrandparents. It meant parents-of-the-parents, long ago.\u201D\r\n\u201CBack and back and back?\u201D Jonas began to laugh. \u201CSo actually, there could be parents-of-the-parents-of-the-parents-of-the parents?\u201D\r\nThe Giver laughed, too. \u201CThat\u2019s right. It\u2019s a little like looking at yourself looking in a mirror looking at yourself looking in a mirror.\u201D\r\nJonas frowned. \u201CBut my parents must have had parents! I never thought about it before. Who are my parents-of-the-parents?\r\nWhereare they?\u201D\r\n\u201CYou could go look in the Hall of Open Records. You\u2019d find the names. But think, son. If you apply for children, then who will be their parents-of-the-parents? Who will be their grandparents?\u201D\r\n\u201CMy mother and father, of course.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd where will they be?\u201D\r\nJonas thought. \u201COh,\u201D he said slowly. \u201CWhen I finish my training and become a full adult, I\u2019ll be given my own dwelling. And then when Lily does, a few years later, she\u2019ll get\r\nherown dwelling, and maybe a spouse, and children if she applies for them, and then Mother and Father\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s right.\u201D\r\n\u201CAs long as they\u2019re still working and contributing to the community, they\u2019ll go and live with the other Childless Adults. And they won\u2019t be part of my life anymore.\r\n\u201CAnd after that, when the time comes, they\u2019ll go to the House of the Old,\u201D Jonas went on. He was thinking aloud. \u201CAnd they\u2019ll be well cared for, and respected, and when they\u2019re released, there will be a celebration.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhich you won\u2019t attend,\u201D The Giver pointed out.\r\n\u201CNo, of course not, because I won\u2019t even know about it. By then I\u2019ll be so busy with my own life. And Lily will, too. So our children, if we have them, won\u2019t know who their parents-of-parents are, either.\r\n\u201CIt seems to work pretty well that way, doesn\u2019t it? The way we do it in our community?\u201D Jonas asked. \u201CI just didn\u2019t realize there was any other way, until I received that memory.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt works,\u201D The Giver agreed.\r\nJonas hesitated. \u201CI certainly liked the memory, though. I can see why it\u2019s your favorite. I couldn\u2019t quite get the word for the whole feeling of it, the feeling that was so strong in the room.\u201D\r\n\u201CLove,\u201D The Giver told him.\r\nJonas repeated it. \u201CLove.\u201D It was a word and concept new to him.\r\nThey were both silent for a minute. Then Jonas said, \u201CGiver?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes?\u201D\r\n\u201CI feel very foolish saying this. Very, very foolish.\u201D\r\n\u201CNo need. Nothing is foolish here. Trust the memories and how they make you feel.\u201D\r\n\u201CWell,\u201D Jonas said, looking at the floor, \u201CI know you don\u2019t have the memory anymore, because you gave it to me, so maybe you won\u2019t understand this\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CI will. I am left with a vague wisp of that one; and I have many other memories of families, and holidays, and happiness. Of love.\u201D\r\nJonas blurted out what he was feeling. \u201CI was thinking that .\u00A0.\u00A0. well, I can see that it wasn\u2019t a very practical way to live, with the Old right there in the same place, where maybe they wouldn\u2019t be well taken care of, the way they are now, and that we have a better-arranged way of doing things. But anyway, I was thinking, I mean feeling, actually, that it was kind of nice, then. And that I wish we could be that way, and that you could be my grandparent. The family in the memory seemed a little more\u2014\u201D He faltered, not able to find the word he wanted.\r\n\u201CA little more complete,\u201D The Giver suggested.\r\nJonas nodded. \u201CI liked the feeling of love,\u201D he confessed. He glanced nervously at the speaker on the wall, reassuring himself that no one was listening. \u201CI wish we still had that,\u201D he whispered. \u201COf course,\u201D he added quickly, \u201CI do understand that it wouldn\u2019t work very well. And that it\u2019s much better to be organized the way we are now. I can see that it was a\r\ndangerousway to live.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat do you mean?\u201D\r\nJonas hesitated. He wasn\u2019t certain, really, what he had meant. He could feel that there was\r\nriskinvolved, though he wasn\u2019t sure how. \u201CWell,\u201D he said finally, grasping for an explanation, \u201Cthey had\r\nfireright there in that room. There was a fire burning in the fireplace. And there were candles on a table. I can certainly see why those things were outlawed.\r\n\u201CStill,\u201D he said slowly, almost to himself, \u201CI did like the light they made. And the warmth.\u201D\r\n\u201CFather? Mother?\u201D Jonas asked tentatively after the evening meal. \u201CI have a question I want to ask you.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat is it, Jonas?\u201D his father asked.\r\nHe made himself say the words, though he felt flushed with embarrassment. He had rehearsed them in his mind all the way home from the Annex.\r\n\u201CDo you love me?\u201D\r\nThere was an awkward silence for a moment. Then Father gave a little chuckle. \u201C\r\nJonas. You, of all people. Precision of language,\r\nplease!\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat do you mean?\u201D Jonas asked. Amusement was not at all what he had anticipated.\r\n\u201CYour father means that you used a very generalized word, so meaningless that it\u2019s become almost obsolete,\u201D his mother explained carefully.\r\nJonas stared at them. Meaningless? He had never before felt anything as meaningful as the memory.\r\n\u201CAnd of course our community can\u2019t function smoothly if people don\u2019t use precise language. You could ask, \u2018Do you enjoy me?\u2019 The answer is \u2018Yes,\u2019\u201D his mother said.\r\n\u201COr,\u201D his father suggested, \u201C\u2018Do you take pride in my accomplishments?\u2019 And the answer is wholeheartedly \u2018Yes.\u2019\u201D\r\n\u201CDo you understand why it\u2019s inappropriate to use a word like \u2018love\u2019?\u201D Mother asked.\r\nJonas nodded. \u201CYes, thank you, I do,\u201D he replied slowly.\r\nIt was his first lie to his parents.\r\n\u201CGabriel?\u201D Jonas whispered that night to the newchild. The crib was in his room again. After Gabe had slept soundly in Jonas\u2019s room for four nights, his parents had pronounced the experiment a success and Jonas a hero. Gabriel was growing rapidly, now crawling and giggling across the room and pulling himself up to stand. He could be upgraded in the Nurturing Center, Father said happily, now that he slept; he could be officially named and given to his family in December, which was only two months away.\r\nBut when he was taken away, he stopped sleeping again, and cried in the night.\r\nSo he was back in Jonas\u2019s sleepingroom. They would give it a little more time, they decided. Since Gabe seemed to like it in Jonas\u2019s room, he would sleep there at night a little longer, until the habit of sound sleep was fully formed. The Nurturers were very optimistic about Gabriel\u2019s future.\r\nThere was no answer to Jonas\u2019s whisper. Gabriel was sound asleep.\r\n\u201CThings could change, Gabe,\u201D Jonas went on. \u201CThings could be different. I don\u2019t know how, but there must be some way for things to be different. There could be colors.\r\n\u201CAnd grandparents,\u201D he added, staring through the dimness toward the ceiling of his sleepingroom. \u201CAnd everybody would have the memories.\r\n\u201CYou know about memories,\u201D he whispered, turning toward the crib.\r\nGabriel\u2019s breathing was even and deep. Jonas liked having him there, though he felt guilty about the secret. Each night he gave memories to Gabriel: memories of boat rides and picnics in the sun; memories of soft rainfall against windowpanes; memories of dancing barefoot on a damp lawn.\r\n\u201CGabe?\u201D\r\nThe newchild stirred slightly in his sleep. Jonas looked over at him.\r\n\u201CThere could be love,\u201D Jonas whispered.\r\nThe next morning, for the first time, Jonas did not take his pill. Something within him, something that had grown there through the memories, told him to throw the pill away.",

      "Contents": "Unknown\r\nSeventeen\r\nT\r\nODAY IS DECLARED AN UNSCHEDULED HOLIDAY.Jonas, his parents, and Lily all turned in surprise and looked at the wall speaker from which the announcement had come. It happened so rarely, and was such a treat for the entire community when it did. Adults were exempted from the day\u2019s work, children from school and training and volunteer hours. The substitute Laborers, who would be given a different holiday, took over all the necessary tasks: nurturing, food delivery, and care of the Old; and the community was free.\r\nJonas cheered, and put his homework folder down. He had been about to leave for school. School was less important to him now; and before much more time passed, his formal schooling would end. But still, for Twelves, though they had begun their adult training, there were the endless lists of rules to be memorized and the newest technology to be mastered.\r\nHe wished his parents, sister, and Gabe a happy day, and rode down the bicycle path, looking for Asher.\r\nHe had not taken the pills, now, for four weeks. The Stirrings had returned, and he felt a little guilty and embarrassed about the pleasurable dreams that came to him as he slept. But he knew he couldn\u2019t go back to the world of no feelings that he had lived in so long.\r\nAnd his new, heightened feelings permeated a greater realm than simply his sleep. Though he knew that his failure to take the pills accounted for some of it, he thought that the feelings came also from the memories. Now he could see all of the colors; and he could\r\nkeepthem, too, so that the trees and grass and bushes stayed green in his vision. Gabriel\u2019s rosy cheeks stayed pink, even when he slept. And apples were always, always red.\r\nNow, through the memories, he had seen oceans and mountain lakes and streams that gurgled through woods; and now he saw the familiar wide river beside the path differently. He saw all of the light and color and history it contained and carried in its slow-moving water; and he knew that there was an Elsewhere from which it came, and an Elsewhere to which it was going.\r\nOn this unexpected, casual holiday he felt happy, as he always had on holidays; but with a deeper happiness than ever before. Thinking, as he always did, about precision of language, Jonas realized that it was a new\r\ndepthof feelings that he was experiencing. Somehow they were not at all the same as the feelings that every evening, in every dwelling, every citizen analyzed with endless talk.\r\n\u201CI felt angry because someone broke the play area rules,\u201D Lily had said once, making a fist with her small hand to indicate her fury. Her family\u2014Jonas among them\u2014had talked about the possible reasons for rule-breaking, and the need for understanding and patience, until Lily\u2019s fist had relaxed and her anger was gone.\r\nBut Lily had not felt anger, Jonas realized now. Shallow impatience and exasperation, that was all Lily had felt. He knew that with certainty because now he knew what anger was. Now he had, in the memories, experienced injustice and cruelty, and he had reacted with rage that welled up so passionately inside him that the thought of discussing it calmly at the evening meal was unthinkable.\r\n\u201CI felt sad today,\u201D he had heard his mother say, and they had comforted her.\r\nBut now Jonas had experienced real sadness. He had felt grief. He knew that there was no quick comfort for emotions like those.\r\nThese were deeper and they did not need to be told. They were\r\nfelt.\r\nToday, he felt happiness.\r\n\u201CAsher!\u201D He spied his friend\u2019s bicycle leaning against a tree at the edge of the playing field. Nearby, other bikes were strewn about on the ground. On a holiday the usual rules of order could be disregarded.\r\nHe skidded to a stop and dropped his own bike beside the others. \u201CHey, Ash!\u201D he shouted, looking around. There seemed to be no one in the play area. \u201CWhere are you?\u201D\r\n\u201CPsssheeewwww!\u201D A child\u2019s voice, coming from behind a nearby bush, made the sound. \u201CPow! Pow! Pow!\u201D\r\nA female Eleven named Tanya staggered forward from where she had been hiding. Dramatically she clutched her stomach and stumbled about in a zig-zag pattern, groaning. \u201CYou got me!\u201D she called, and fell to the ground, grinning.\r\n\u201CBlam!\u201D\r\nJonas, standing on the side of the playing field, recognized Asher\u2019s voice. He saw his friend, aiming an imaginary weapon in his hand, dart from behind one tree to another. \u201CBlam! You\u2019re in my line of ambush, Jonas! Watch out!\u201D\r\nJonas stepped back. He moved behind Asher\u2019s bike and knelt so that he was out of sight. It was a game he had often played with the other children, a game of good guys and bad guys, a harmless pasttime that used up their contained energy and ended only when they all lay posed in freakish postures on the ground.\r\nHe had never recognized it before as a game of war.\r\n\u201CAttack!\u201D The shout came from behind the small storehouse where play equipment was kept. Three children dashed forward, their imaginary weapons in firing position.\r\nFrom the opposite side of the field came an opposing shout: \u201CCounter-attack!\u201D From their hiding places a horde of children\u2014Jonas recognized Fiona in the group\u2014emerged, running in a crouched position, firing across the field. Several of them stopped, grabbed their own shoulders and chests with exaggerated gestures, and pretended to be hit. They dropped to the ground and lay suppressing giggles.\r\nFeelings surged within Jonas. He found himself walking forward into the field.\r\n\u201CYou\u2019re hit, Jonas!\u201D Asher yelled from behind the tree. \u201CPow! You\u2019re hit again!\u201D\r\nJonas stood alone in the center of the field. Several of the children raised their heads and looked at him uneasily. The attacking armies slowed, emerged from their crouched positions, and watched to see what he was doing.\r\nIn his mind, Jonas saw again the face of the boy who had lain dying on a field and had begged him for water. He had a sudden choking feeling, as if it were difficult to breathe.\r\nOne of the children raised an imaginary rifle and made an attempt to destroy him with a firing noise. \u201CPssheeew!\u201D Then they were all silent, standing awkwardly, and the only sound was the sound of Jonas\u2019s shuddering breaths. He was struggling not to cry.\r\nGradually, when nothing happened, nothing changed, the children looked at each other nervously and went away. He heard the sounds as they righted their bicycles and began to ride down the path that led from the field.\r\nOnly Asher and Fiona remained.\r\n\u201CWhat\u2019s wrong, Jonas? It was only a game,\u201D Fiona said.\r\n\u201CYou ruined it,\u201D Asher said in an irritated voice.\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t play it anymore,\u201D Jonas pleaded.\r\n\u201CI\u2019m the one who\u2019s training for Assistant Recreation Director,\u201D Asher pointed out angrily. \u201CGames aren\u2019t\r\nyourarea of expertness.\u201D\r\n\u201CExpertise,\u201D Jonas corrected him automatically.\r\n\u201CWhatever. You can\u2019t say what we play, even if you\r\naregoing to be the new Receiver.\u201D Asher looked warily at him. \u201CI apologize for not paying you the respect you deserve,\u201D he mumbled.\r\n\u201CAsher,\u201D Jonas said. He was trying to speak carefully, and with kindness, to say exactly what he wanted to say. \u201CYou had no way of knowing this. I didn\u2019t know it myself until recently. But it\u2019s a cruel game. In the past, there have\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CI said I\r\napologize,Jonas.\u201D\r\nJonas sighed. It was no use. Of course Asher couldn\u2019t understand. \u201CI accept your apology, Asher,\u201D he said wearily.\r\n\u201CDo you want to go for a ride along the river, Jonas?\u201D Fiona asked, biting her lip with nervousness.\r\nJonas looked at her. She was so lovely. For a fleeting instant he thought he would like nothing better than to ride peacefully along the river path, laughing and talking with his gentle female friend. But he knew that such times had been taken from him now. He shook his head. After a moment his two friends turned and went to their bikes. He watched as they rode away.\r\nJonas trudged to the bench beside the Storehouse and sat down, overwhelmed with feelings of loss. His childhood, his friendships, his carefree sense of security\u2014all of these things seemed to be slipping away. With his new, heightened feelings, he was overwhelmed by sadness at the way the others had laughed and shouted, playing at war. But he knew that they could not understand why, without the memories. He felt such love for Asher and for Fiona. But they could not feel it back, without the memories. And he could not give them those. Jonas knew with certainty that he could change nothing.\r\nBack in their dwelling, that evening, Lily chattered merrily about the wonderful holiday she had had, playing with her friends, having her midday meal out of doors, and (she confessed) sneaking a very short try on her father\u2019s bicycle.\r\n\u201CI can\u2019t wait till I get my very own bicycle next month. Father\u2019s is too big for me. I fell,\u201D she explained matter-of-factly. \u201CGood thing Gabe wasn\u2019t in the child seat!\u201D\r\n\u201CA very good thing,\u201D Mother agreed, frowning at the idea of it. Gabriel waved his arms at the mention of himself. He had begun to walk just the week before. The first steps of a newchild were always the occasion for celebration at the Nurturing Center, Father said, but also for the introduction of a discipline wand. Now Father brought the slender instrument home with him each night, in case Gabriel misbehaved.\r\nBut he was a happy and easygoing toddler. Now he moved unsteadily across the room, laughing. \u201CGay!\u201D he chirped. \u201CGay!\u201D It was the way he said his own name.\r\nJonas brightened. It had been a depressing day for him, after such a bright start. But he set his glum thoughts aside. He thought about starting to teach Lily to ride so that she could speed off proudly after her Ceremony of Nine, which would be coming soon. It was hard to believe that it was almost December again, that almost a year had passed since he had become a Twelve.\r\nHe smiled as he watched the newchild plant one small foot carefully before the other, grinning with glee at his own steps as he tried them out.\r\n\u201CI want to get to sleep early tonight,\u201D Father said. \u201CTomorrow\u2019s a busy day for me. The twins are being born tomorrow, and the test results show that they\u2019re identical.\u201D\r\n\u201COne for here, one for Elsewhere,\u201D Lily chanted. \u201COne for here, one for Else\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CDo you actually\r\ntakeit Elsewhere, Father?\u201D Jonas asked.\r\n\u201CNo, I just have to make the selection. I weigh them, hand the larger over to a Nurturer who\u2019s standing by, waiting, and then I get the smaller one all cleaned up and comfy.

He waved his hand in the familiar gesture.\r\nGabriel giggled and waved bye-bye back to him.\r\n\u201CAnd somebody else comes to get him? Somebody from Elsewhere?\u201D\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s right, Jonas-bonus.\u201D\r\nJonas rolled his eyes in embarrassment that his father had used the silly pet name.\r\nLily was deep in thought. \u201CWhat if they give the little twin a name Elsewhere, a name like, oh, maybe Jonathan? And here, in our community, at his naming, the twin that we kept here is given the name Jonathan, and then there would be two children with the same name, and they would\r\nlookexactly the same, and someday, maybe when they were a Six, one group of Sixes would go to visit another community on a bus, and there in the other community, in the\r\nothergroup of Sixes, would be a Jonathan who was exactly the same as the\r\notherJonathan, and then maybe they would get mixed up and take the wrong Jonathan home, and maybe his parents wouldn\u2019t notice, and then\u2014\u201D\r\nShe paused for breath.\r\n\u201CLily,\u201D Mother said, \u201CI have a wonderful idea. Maybe when you become a Twelve, they\u2019ll give you the Assignment of Storyteller! I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve had a Storyteller in the community for a long time. But if I were on the Committee, I would definitely choose you for that job!\u201D\r\nLily grinned. \u201CI have a\r\nbetteridea for one more story,\u201D she announced. \u201CWhat if actually we were\r\nalltwins and didn\u2019t know it, and so Elsewhere there would be another Lily, and another Jonas, and another Father, and another Asher, and another Chief Elder, and another\u2014\u201D\r\nFather groaned. \u201CLily,\u201D he said. \u201CIt\u2019s bedtime.\u201D",

I apologi\u2014I mean I should have been more precise. But I don\u2019t know exactly what I meant.\u201D\r\n\u201CSit back up. No need to lie down while we\u2019re talking.\u201D Jonas, who had already been stretched out on the bed when the question came to his mind, sat back up.\r\n\u201CI guess I do think about it occasionally,\u201D The Giver said. \u201CI think about my own release when I\u2019m in an awful lot of pain. I wish I could put in a request for it, sometimes. But I\u2019m not permitted to do that until the new Receiver is trained.\u201D\r\n\u201CMe,\u201D Jonas said in a dejected voice. He was not looking forward to the end of the training, when he would become the new Receiver. It was clear to him what a terribly difficult and lonely life it was, despite the honor.\r\n\u201CI can\u2019t request release either,\u201D Jonas pointed out. \u201CIt was in my rules.\u201D\r\nThe Giver laughed harshly. \u201CI know that. They hammered out those rules after the failure ten years ago.\u201D\r\nJonas had heard again and again now, reference to the previous failure. But he still did not know what had happened ten years before. \u201CGiver,\u201D he said, \u201Ctell me what happened. Please.\u201D\r\nThe Giver shrugged. \u201COn the surface, it was quite simple. A Receiver-to-be was selected, the way you were. The selection went smoothly enough. The Ceremony was held, and the selection was made. The crowd cheered, as they did for you. The new Receiver was puzzled and a little frightened, as you were.\u201D\r\n\u201CMy parents told me it was a female.\u201D\r\nThe Giver nodded.\r\nJonas thought of his favorite female, Fiona, and shivered. He wouldn\u2019t want his gentle friend to suffer the way he had, taking on the memories. \u201CWhat was she like?\u201D he asked The Giver.\r\nThe Giver looked sad, thinking about it. \u201CShe was a remarkable young woman. Very self-possessed and serene. Intelligent, eager to learn.\u201D He shook his head and drew a deep breath. \u201CYou know, Jonas, when she came to me in this room, when she presented herself to begin her training\u2014\u201D\r\nJonas interrupted him with a question. \u201CCan you tell me her name? My parents said that it wasn\u2019t to be spoken again in the community. But couldn\u2019t you say it just to me?\u201D\r\nThe Giver hesitated painfully, as if saying the name aloud might be excruciating. \u201CHer name was Rosemary,\u201D he told Jonas, finally.\r\n\u201CRosemary. I like that name.\u201D\r\nThe Giver went on. \u201CWhen she came to me for the first time, she sat there in the chair where you sat on your first day. She was eager and excited and a little scared. We talked. I tried to explain things as well as I could.\u201D\r\n\u201CThe way you did to me.\u201D\r\nThe Giver chuckled ruefully. \u201CThe explanations are difficult. The whole thing is so beyond one\u2019s experience. But I tried. And she listened carefully. Her eyes were very luminous, I remember.\u201D\r\nHe looked up suddenly. \u201CJonas, I gave you a memory that I told you was my favorite. I still have a shred of it left. The room, with the family, and grandparents?\u201D\r\nJonas nodded. Of course he remembered. \u201CYes,\u201D he said. \u201CIt had that wonderful feeling with it. You told me it was love.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou can understand, then, that that\u2019s what I felt for Rosemary,\u201D The Giver explained. \u201CI loved her.\r\n\u201CI feel it for you, too,\u201D he added.\r\n\u201CWhat happened to her?\u201D Jonas asked.\r\n\u201CHer training began. She received well, as you do. She was so enthusiastic. So delighted to experience new things. I remember her laughter .\u00A0.\u00A0.\u201D\r\nHis voice faltered and trailed off.\r\n\u201CWhat happened?\u201D Jonas asked again, after a moment. \u201CPlease tell me.\u201D\r\nThe Giver closed his eyes. \u201CIt broke my heart, Jonas, to transfer pain to her. But it was my job. It was what I had to do, the way I\u2019ve had to do it to you.\u201D\r\nThe room was silent. Jonas waited. Finally The Giver continued.\r\n\u201CFive weeks. That was all. I gave her happy memories: a ride on a merry-go-round; a kitten to play with; a picnic. Sometimes I chose one just because I knew it would make her laugh, and I so treasured the sound of that laughter in this room that had always been so silent.\r\n\u201CBut she was like you, Jonas. She wanted to experience everything. She knew that it was her responsibility. And so she asked me for more difficult memories.\u201D\r\nJonas held his breath for a moment. \u201CYou didn\u2019t give her\r\nwar,did you? Not after just five weeks?\u201D\r\nThe Giver shook his head and sighed. \u201CNo. And I didn\u2019t give her physical pain. But I gave her loneliness. And I gave her loss. I transferred a memory of a child taken from its parents. That was the first one. She appeared stunned at its end.\u201D\r\nJonas swallowed. Rosemary, and her laughter, had begun to seem real to him, and he pictured her looking up from the bed of memories, shocked.\r\nThe Giver continued. \u201CI backed off, gave her more little delights. But everything changed, once she knew about pain. I could see it in her eyes.\u201D\r\n\u201CShe wasn\u2019t brave enough?\u201D Jonas suggested.\r\nThe Giver didn\u2019t respond to the question. \u201CShe insisted that I continue, that I not spare her. She said it was her duty. And I knew, of course, that she was correct.\r\n\u201CI couldn\u2019t bring myself to inflict physical pain on her. But I gave her anguish of many kinds. Poverty, and hunger, and terror.\r\n\u201CI\r\nhadto, Jonas. It was my job. And she had been chosen.\u201D The Giver looked at him imploringly. Jonas stroked his hand.\r\n\u201CFinally one afternoon, we finished for the day. It had been a hard session. I tried to finish\u2014as I do with you\u2014by transferring something happy and cheerful. But the times of laughter were gone by then. She stood up very silently, frowning, as if she were making a decision. Then she came over to me and put her arms around me. She kissed my cheek.\u201D As Jonas watched, The Giver stroked his own cheek, recalling the touch of Rosemary\u2019s lips ten years before.\r\n\u201CShe left here that day, left this room, and did not go back to her dwelling. I was notified by the Speaker that she had gone directly to the Chief Elder and asked to be released.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut it\u2019s against the rules! The Receiver-in-training can\u2019t apply for rel\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s in your rules, Jonas. But it wasn\u2019t in hers. She asked for release, and they had to give it to her. I never saw her again.\u201D\r\nSo that was the failure, Jonas thought. It was obvious that it saddened The Giver very deeply. But it didn\u2019t seem such a terrible thing, after all. And he, Jonas, would never have done it\u2014never have requested release, no matter how difficult his training became. The Giver needed a successor, and he had been chosen.\r\nA thought occurred to Jonas. Rosemary had been released very early in her training. What if something happened to him, Jonas? He had a whole year\u2019s worth of memories now.\r\n\u201CGiver,\u201D he asked, \u201CI can\u2019t request release, I know that. But what if something happened: an accident? What if I fell into the river like the little Four, Caleb, did? Well, that doesn\u2019t make sense because I\u2019m a good swimmer. But what if I couldn\u2019t swim, and fell into the river and was lost? Then there wouldn\u2019t be a new Receiver, but you would already have given away an awful lot of important memories, so even though they would select a new Receiver, the memories would be gone except for the shreds that you have left of them? And then what if\u2014\u201D\r\nHe started to laugh, suddenly. \u201CI sound like my sister, Lily,\u201D he said, amused at himself.\r\nThe Giver looked at him gravely. \u201CYou just stay away from the river, my friend,\u201D he said. \u201CThe community lost Rosemary after five weeks and it was a disaster for them. I don\u2019t know\r\nwhatthe community would do if they lost you.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhy was it a disaster?\u201D\r\n\u201CI think I mentioned to you once,\u201D The Giver reminded him, \u201Cthat when she was gone, the memories came back to the people. If you were to be lost in the river, Jonas, your memories would not be lost with you. Memories are\r\nforever.\r\n\u201CRosemary had only those five weeks worth, and most of them were good ones. But there were those few terrible memories, the ones that had overwhelmed her. For a while they overwhelmed the community. All those\r\nfeelings!They\u2019d never experienced that before.\r\n\u201CI was so devastated by my own grief at her loss, and my own feeling of failure, that I didn\u2019t even try to help them through it. I was angry, too.\u201D\r\nThe Giver was quiet for a moment, obviously thinking. \u201CYou know,\u201D he said, finally, \u201Cif they lost\r\nyou,with all the training you\u2019ve had now, they\u2019d have all those memories again themselves.\u201D\r\nJonas made a face. \u201CThey\u2019d hate that.\u201D\r\n\u201CThey certainly would. They wouldn\u2019t know how to deal with it at all.\u201D\r\n\u201CThe only way\r\nIdeal with it is by having you there to help me,\u201D Jonas pointed out with a sigh.\r\nThe Giver nodded. \u201CI suppose,\u201D he said slowly, \u201Cthat I could\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CYou could what?\u201D\r\nThe Giver was still deep in thought. After a moment, he said, \u201CIf you floated off in the river, I suppose I could help the whole community the way I\u2019ve helped you. It\u2019s an interesting concept. I need to think about it some more. Maybe we\u2019ll talk about it again sometime. But not now.\r\n\u201CI\u2019m glad you\u2019re a good swimmer, Jonas. But stay away from the river.\u201D He laughed a little, but the laughter was not lighthearted. His thoughts seemed to be elsewhere, and his eyes were very troubled.",

There was so much work to be done, always, that he and The Giver seldom simply sat and talked, the way they just had.\r\n\u201CI\u2019m sorry that I wasted so much time with my questions,\u201D Jonas said. \u201CI was only asking about release because my father is releasing a newchild today. A twin. He has to select one and release the other one. They do it by weight.\u201D Jonas glanced at the clock. \u201CActually, I suppose he\u2019s already finished. I think it was this morning.\u201D\r\nThe Giver\u2019s face took on a solemn look. \u201CI wish they wouldn\u2019t do that,\u201D he said quietly, almost to himself.\r\n\u201CWell, they can\u2019t have two identical people around! Think how confusing it would be!\u201D Jonas chuckled.\r\n\u201CI wish I could watch,\u201D he added, as an afterthought. He liked the thought of seeing his father perform the ceremony, and making the little twin clean and comfy. His father was such a gentle man.\r\n\u201CYou can watch,\u201D The Giver said.\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D Jonas told him. \u201CThey never let children watch. It\u2019s very private.\u201D\r\n\u201CJonas,\u201D The Giver told him, \u201CI know that you read your training instructions very carefully. Don\u2019t you remember that you are allowed to ask anyone anything?\u201D\r\nJonas nodded. \u201CYes, but\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CJonas, when you and I have finished our time together, you will be the new Receiver. You can read the books; you\u2019ll have the memories. You have access to\r\neverything. It\u2019s part of your training. If you want to watch a release, you have simply to ask.\u201D\r\nJonas shrugged. \u201CWell, maybe I will, then. But it\u2019s too late for this one. I\u2019m sure it was this morning.\u201D\r\nThe Giver told him, then, something he had not known. \u201CAll private ceremonies are recorded. They\u2019re in the Hall of Closed Records.\r\nDo you want to see this morning\u2019s release?\u201D\r\nJonas hesitated. He was afraid that his father wouldn\u2019t like it, if he watched something so private.\r\n\u201CI think you should,\u201D The Giver told him firmly.\r\n\u201CAll right, then,\u201D Jonas said. \u201CTell me how.\u201D\r\nThe Giver rose from his chair, went to the speaker on the wall, and clicked the switch from\r\nOFFto\r\nON.\r\nThe voice spoke immediately. \u201CYes, Receiver. How may I help you?\u201D\r\n\u201CI would like to see this morning\u2019s release of the twin.\u201D\r\n\u201COne moment, Receiver. Thank you for your instructions.\u201D\r\nJonas watched the video screen above the row of switches. Its blank face began to flicker with zig-zag lines; then some numbers appeared, followed by the date and time. He was astonished and delighted that this was available to him, and surprised that he had not known.\r\nSuddenly he could see a small windowless room, empty except for a bed, a table with some equipment on it\u2014Jonas recognized a scale; he had seen them before, when he\u2019d been doing volunteer hours at the Nurturing Center\u2014and a cupboard. He could see pale carpeting on the floor.\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s just an ordinary room,\u201D he commented. \u201CI thought maybe they\u2019d have it in the Auditorium, so that everybody could come. All the Old go to Ceremonies of Release. But I suppose that when it\u2019s just a newborn, they don\u2019t\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CShhh,\u201D The Giver said, his eyes on the screen.\r\nJonas\u2019s father, wearing his nurturing uniform, entered the room, cradling a tiny newchild wrapped in a soft blanket in his arms. A uniformed woman followed through the door, carrying a second newchild wrapped in a similar blanket.\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s my father.\u201D Jonas found himself whispering, as if he might wake the little ones if he spoke aloud. \u201CAnd the other Nurturer is his assistant. She\u2019s still in training, but she\u2019ll be finished soon.\u201D\r\nThe two Nurturers unwrapped the blankets and laid the identical newborns on the bed. They were naked. Jonas could see that they were males.\r\nHe watched, fascinated, as his father gently lifted one and then the other to the scale and weighed them.\r\nHe heard his father laugh. \u201CGood,\u201D his father said to the woman. \u201CI thought for a moment that they might both be exactly the same.\r\nThenwe\u2019d have a problem. But this one,\u201D he handed one, after rewrapping it, to his assistant, \u201Cis six pounds even. So you can clean him up and dress him and take him over to the Center.\u201D\r\nThe woman took the newchild and left through the door she had entered.\r\nJonas watched as his father bent over the squirming newchild on the bed. \u201CAnd you, little guy, you\u2019re only five pounds ten ounces. A\r\nshrimp!\u201D\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s the special voice he uses with Gabriel,\u201D Jonas remarked, smiling.\r\n\u201CWatch,\u201D The Giver said.\r\n\u201CNow he cleans him up and makes him comfy,\u201D Jonas told him. \u201CHe told me.\u201D\r\n\u201CBe quiet, Jonas,\u201D The Giver commanded in a strange voice. \u201C\r\nWatch.\u201D\r\nObediently Jonas concentrated on the screen, waiting for what would happen next. He was especially curious about the ceremony part.\r\nHis father turned and opened the cupboard. He took out a syringe and a small bottle. Very carefully he inserted the needle into the bottle and began to fill the syringe with a clear liquid.\r\nJonas winced sympathetically. He had forgotten that newchildren had to get shots. He hated shots himself, though he knew that they were necessary.\r\nTo his surprise, his father began very carefully to direct the needle into the top of newchild\u2019s forehead, puncturing the place where the fragile skin pulsed. The newborn squirmed, and wailed faintly.\r\n\u201CWhy\u2019s he\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CShhh,\u201D The Giver said sharply.\r\nHis father was talking, and Jonas realized that he was hearing the answer to the question he had started to ask. Still in the special voice, his father was saying, \u201CI know, I know. It hurts, little guy. But I have to use a vein, and the veins in your arms are still too teeny-weeny.\u201D\r\nHe pushed the plunger very slowly, injecting the liquid into the scalp vein until the syringe was empty.\r\n\u201CAll done. That wasn\u2019t so bad, was it?\u201D Jonas heard his father say cheerfully. He turned aside and dropped the syringe into a waste receptacle.\r\nNowhe cleans him up and makes him comfy, Jonas said to himself, aware that The Giver didn\u2019t want to talk during the little ceremony.\r\nAs he continued to watch, the newchild, no longer crying, moved his arms and legs in a jerking motion. Then he went limp. His head fell to the side, his eyes half open. Then he was still.\r\nWith an odd, shocked feeling, Jonas recognized the gestures and posture and expression. They were familiar. He had seen them before. But he couldn\u2019t remember where.\r\nJonas stared at the screen, waiting for something to happen. But nothing did. The little twin lay motionless. His father was putting things away. Folding the blanket. Closing the cupboard.\r\nOnce again, as he had on the playing field, he felt the choking sensation. Once again he saw the face of the light-haired, bloodied soldier as life left his eyes. The memory came back.\r\nHe killed it! My father killed it!Jonas said to himself, stunned at what he was realizing. He continued to stare at the screen numbly.\r\nHis father tidied the room. Then he picked up a small carton that lay waiting on the floor, set it on the bed, and lifted the limp body into it. He placed the lid on tightly.\r\nHe picked up the carton and carried it to the other side of the room. He opened a small door in the wall; Jonas could see darkness behind the door. It seemed to be the same sort of chute into which trash was deposited at school.\r\nHis father loaded the carton containing the body into the chute and gave it a shove.\r\n\u201CBye-bye, little guy,\u201D Jonas heard his father say before he left the room. Then the screen went blank.\r\nThe Giver turned to him. Quite calmly, he related, \u201CWhen the Speaker notified me that Rosemary had applied for release, they turned on the tape to show me the process. There she was\u2014my last glimpse of that beautiful child\u2014waiting. They brought in the syringe and asked her to roll up her sleeve.\r\n\u201CYou suggested, Jonas, that perhaps she wasn\u2019t brave enough? I don\u2019t know about bravery: what it is, what it means. I do know that I sat here numb with horror. Wretched with helplessness. And I listened as Rosemary told them that she would prefer to inject herself.\r\n\u201CThen she did so. I didn\u2019t watch. I looked away.\u201D\r\nThe Giver turned to him. \u201CWell, there you are, Jonas. You were wondering about release,\u201D he said in a bitter voice.\r\nJonas felt a ripping sensation inside himself, the feeling of terrible pain clawing its way forward to emerge in a cry.",

You can\u2019t make me!\u201D Jonas sobbed and shouted and pounded the bed with his fists.\r\n\u201CSit up, Jonas,\u201D The Giver told him firmly.\r\nJonas obeyed him. Weeping, shuddering, he sat on the edge of the bed. He would not look at The Giver.\r\n\u201CYou may stay here tonight. I want to talk to you. But you must be quiet now, while I notify your family unit. No one must hear you cry.\u201D\r\nJonas looked up wildly. \u201CNo one heard that little twin cry, either! No one but my father!\u201D He collapsed in sobs again.\r\nThe Giver waited silently. Finally Jonas was able to quiet himself and he sat huddled, his shoulders shaking.\r\nThe Giver went to the wall speaker and clicked the switch to\r\nON.\r\n\u201CYes, Receiver. How may I help you?\u201D\r\n\u201CNotify the new Receiver\u2019s family unit that he will be staying with me tonight, for additional training.\u201D\r\n\u201CI will take care of that, sir. Thank you for your instructions,\u201D the voice said.\r\n\u201CI will take care of that, sir. I will take care of that, sir,\u201D Jonas mimicked in a cruel, sarcastic voice. \u201CI will do whatever you like, sir. I will kill people, sir. Old people? Small newborn people? I\u2019d be happy to kill them, sir. Thank you for your instructions, sir. How may I help y\u2014\u201D He couldn\u2019t seem to stop.\r\nThe Giver grasped his shoulders firmly. Jonas fell silent and stared at him.\r\n\u201CListen to me, Jonas. They can\u2019t help it.\r\nThey know nothing.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou said that to me once before.\u201D\r\n\u201CI said it because it\u2019s true. It\u2019s the way they live. It\u2019s the life that was created for them. It\u2019s the same life that you would have, if you had not been chosen as my successor.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut he\r\nliedto me!\u201D Jonas wept.\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s what he was told to do, and he knows nothing else.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat about you? Do\r\nyoulie to me, too?\u201D Jonas almost spat the question at The Giver.\r\n\u201CI am empowered to lie. But I have never lied to you.\u201D\r\nJonas stared at him. \u201CRelease is always like that? For people who break the rules three times? For the\r\nOld?Do they kill the Old, too?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes, it\u2019s true.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd what about Fiona? She loves the Old! She\u2019s in training to care for them. Does she know yet? What will she do when she finds out? How will she feel?\u201D Jonas brushed wetness from his face with the back of one hand.\r\n\u201CFiona is already being trained in the fine art of release,\u201D The Giver told him. \u201CShe\u2019s very efficient at her work, your red-haired friend. Feelings are not part of the life she\u2019s learned.\u201D\r\nJonas wrapped his arms around himself and rocked his own body back and forth. \u201CWhat should I do? I can\u2019t go back! I can\u2019t!\u201D\r\nThe Giver stood up. \u201CFirst, I will order our evening meal. Then we will eat.\u201D\r\nJonas found himself using the nasty, sarcastic voice again. \u201CThen we\u2019ll have a sharing of feelings?\u201D\r\nThe Giver gave a rueful, anguished, empty laugh. \u201CJonas, you and I are the only ones who\r\nhavefeelings. We\u2019ve been sharing them now for almost a year.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m sorry, Giver,\u201D Jonas said miserably. \u201CI don\u2019t mean to be so hateful. Not to you.\u201D\r\nThe Giver rubbed Jonas\u2019s hunched shoulders. \u201CAnd after we eat,\u201D he went on, \u201Cwe\u2019ll make a plan.\u201D\r\nJonas looked up, puzzled. \u201CA plan for what? There\u2019s nothing. There\u2019s nothing we can do. It\u2019s always been this way. Before me, before you, before the ones who came before you. Back and back and back.\u201D His voice trailed the familiar phrase.\r\n\u201CJonas,\u201D The Giver said, after a moment, \u201Cit\u2019s true that it has been this way for what seems forever. But the memories tell us that it has not\r\nalwaysbeen. People felt things once. You and I have been part of that, so we know. We know that they once felt things like pride, and sorrow, and\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd love,\u201D Jonas added, remembering the family scene that had so affected him. \u201CAnd pain.\u201D He thought again of the soldier.\r\n\u201CThe worst part of holding the memories is not the pain. It\u2019s the loneliness of it. Memories need to be shared.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve started to share them with you,\u201D Jonas said, trying to cheer him.\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s true. And having you here with me over the past year has made me realize that things must change. For years I\u2019ve felt that they should, but it seemed so hopeless.\r\n\u201CNow for the first time I think there might be a way,\u201D The Giver said slowly. \u201CAnd you brought it to my attention, barely\u2014\u201D He glanced at the clock. \u201Ctwo hours ago.\u201D\r\nJonas watched him, and listened.\r\nIt was late at night, now. They had talked and talked. Jonas sat wrapped in a robe belonging to The Giver, the long robe that only Elders wore.\r\nIt was possible, what they had planned. Barely possible. If it failed, he would very likely be killed.\r\nBut what did that matter? If he stayed, his life was no longer worth living.\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D he told The Giver. \u201CI\u2019ll do it. I think I can do it. I\u2019ll try, anyway. But I want you to come with me.\u201D\r\nThe Giver shook his head. \u201CJonas,\u201D he said, \u201Cthe community has depended, all these generations, back and back and back, on a resident Receiver to hold their memories for them. I\u2019ve turned over many of them to you in the past year. And I can\u2019t take them back. There\u2019s no way for me to get them back if I have given them.\r\n\u201CSo if you escape, once you are gone\u2014and, Jonas, you know that you can never return\u2014\u201D\r\nJonas nodded solemnly. It was the terrifying part. \u201CYes,\u201D he said, \u201CI know. But if you come with me\u2014\u201D\r\nThe Giver shook his head and made a gesture to silence him. He continued. \u201CIf you get away, if you get beyond, if you get to Elsewhere, it will mean that the community has to bear the burden themselves, of the memories you had been holding for them.\r\n\u201CI think that they can, and that they will acquire some wisdom. But it will be desperately hard for them. When we lost Rosemary ten years ago, and her memories returned to the people, they panicked. And those were such few memories, compared to yours. When your memories return, they\u2019ll need help. Remember how I helped you in the beginning, when the receiving of memories was new to you?\u201D\r\nJonas nodded. \u201CIt was scary at first. And it hurt a lot.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou needed me then. And now they will.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s no use. They\u2019ll find someone to take my place. They\u2019ll choose a new Receiver.\u201D\r\n\u201CThere\u2019s no one ready for training, not right away. Oh, they\u2019ll speed up the selection, of course. But I can\u2019t think of another child who has the right qualities\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CThere\u2019s a little female with pale eyes. But she\u2019s only a Six.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s correct. I know the one you mean. Her name is Katharine. But she\u2019s too young. So they will be\r\nforcedto bear those memories.\u201D\r\n\u201CI want you to come, Giver,\u201D Jonas pleaded.\r\n\u201CNo. I have to stay here,\u201D The Giver said firmly. \u201CI want to, Jonas. If I go with you, and together we take away\r\nalltheir protection from the memories, Jonas, the community will be left with no one to help them. They\u2019ll be thrown into chaos. They\u2019ll destroy themselves. I can\u2019t go.\u201D\r\n\u201CGiver,\u201D Jonas suggested, \u201Cyou and I don\u2019t need to\r\ncareabout the rest of them.\u201D\r\nThe Giver looked at him with a questioning smile. Jonas hung his head. Of course they needed to care. It was the meaning of everything.\r\n\u201CAnd in any case, Jonas,\u201D The Giver sighed, \u201CI wouldn\u2019t make it. I\u2019m very weakened now. Do you know that I no longer see colors?\u201D\r\nJonas\u2019s heart broke. He reached for The Giver\u2019s hand.\r\n\u201CYou have the colors,\u201D The Giver told him. \u201CAnd you have the courage. I will help you to have the strength.\u201D\r\n\u201CA year ago,\u201D Jonas reminded him, \u201Cwhen I had just become a Twelve, when I began to see the first color, you told me that the beginning had been different for you. But that I wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201D\r\nThe Giver brightened. \u201CThat\u2019s true. And do you know, Jonas, that with all your knowledge now, with all your memories, with all you\u2019ve learned\u2014\r\nstillyou won\u2019t understand? Because I\u2019ve been a little selfish. I haven\u2019t given any of it to you. I wanted to keep it for myself to the last.\u201D\r\n\u201CKeep what?\u201D\r\n\u201CWhen I was just a boy, younger than you, it began to come to me. But it wasn\u2019t the seeing-beyond for me. It was different. For me, it was\r\nhearing-beyond.\u201D\r\nJonas frowned, trying to figure that out. \u201CWhat did you hear?\u201D he asked.\r\n\u201CMusic,\u201D The Giver said, smiling. \u201CI began to hear something truly remarkable, and it is called music. I\u2019ll give you some before I go.\u201D\r\nJonas shook his head emphatically. \u201CNo, Giver,\u201D he said. \u201CI want you to keep that, to have with you, when I\u2019m gone.\u201D\r\nJonas went home the next morning, cheerfully greeted his parents, and lied easily about what a busy, pleasant night he had had.\r\nHis father smiled and lied easily, too, about his busy and pleasant day the day before.\r\nThroughout the school day, as he did his lessons, Jonas went over the plan in his head. It seemed startlingly simple. Jonas and The Giver had gone over it and over it, late into the night hours.\r\nFor the next two weeks, as the time for the December Ceremony approached, The Giver would transfer every memory of courage and strength that he could to Jonas. He would need those to help him find the Elsewhere that they were both sure existed. They knew it would be a very difficult journey.\r\nThen, in the middle of the night before the Ceremony, Jonas would secretly leave his dwelling. This was probably the most dangerous part, because it was a violation of a major rule for any citizen not on official business to leave a dwelling at night.\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll leave at midnight,\u201D Jonas said. \u201CThe Food Collectors will be finished picking up the evening-meal remains by then, and the Path-Maintenance Crews don\u2019t start their work that early. So there won\u2019t be anyone to see me, unless of course someone is out on emergency business.\u201D\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know what you should do if you are seen, Jonas,\u201D The Giver had said. \u201CI have memories, of course, of all kinds of escapes. People fleeing from terrible things throughout history. But every situation is individual. There is no memory of one like this.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll be careful,\u201D Jonas said. \u201CNo one will see me.\u201D\r\n\u201CAs Receiver-in-training, you\u2019re held in very high respect already. So I think you wouldn\u2019t be questioned very forcefully.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019d just say I was on some important errand for the Receiver. I\u2019d say it was all your fault that I was out after hours,\u201D Jonas teased.\r\nThey both laughed a little nervously. But Jonas was certain that he could slip away, unseen, from his house, carrying an extra set of clothing. Silently he would take his bicycle to the riverbank and leave it there hidden in bushes with the clothing folded beside it.\r\nThen he would make his way through the darkness, on foot, silently, to the Annex.\r\n\u201CThere\u2019s no nighttime attendant,\u201D The Giver explained. \u201CI\u2019ll leave the door unlocked. You simply slip into the room. I\u2019ll be waiting for you.\u201D\r\nHis parents would discover, when they woke, that he was gone. They would also find a cheerful note from Jonas on his bed, telling them that he was going for an early morning ride along the river; that he would be back for the Ceremony.\r\nHis parents would be irritated but not alarmed. They would think him inconsiderate and they would plan to chastise him, later.\r\nThey would wait, with mounting anger, for him; finally they would be forced to go, taking Lily to the Ceremony without him.\r\n\u201CThey won\u2019t say anything to anyone, though,\u201D Jonas said, quite certain. \u201CThey won\u2019t call attention to my rudeness because it would reflect on their parenting. And anyway, everyone is so involved in the Ceremony that they probably won\u2019t notice that I\u2019m not there. Now that I\u2019m a Twelve and in training, I don\u2019t have to sit with my age group any more. So Asher will think I\u2019m with my parents, or with you\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd your parents will assume you\u2019re with Asher, or with me\u2014\u201D\r\nJonas shrugged. \u201CIt will take everyone a while to realize that I\u2019m not there at all.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd you and I will be long on our way by then.\u201D\r\nIn the early morning, The Giver would order a vehicle and driver from the Speaker. He visited the other communities frequently, meeting with their Elders; his responsibilities extended over all the surrounding areas. So this would not be an unusual undertaking.\r\nOrdinarily The Giver did not attend the December Ceremony. Last year he had been present because of the occasion of Jonas\u2019s selection, in which he was so involved. But his life was usually quite separate from that of the community. No one would comment on his absence, or on the fact that he had chosen this day to be away.\r\nWhen the driver and vehicle arrived, The Giver would send the driver on some brief errand. During his absence, The Giver would help Jonas hide in the storage area of the vehicle. He would have with him a bundle of food which The Giver would save from his own meals during the next two weeks.\r\nThe Ceremony would begin, with all the community there, and by then Jonas and The Giver would be on their way.\r\nBy midday Jonas\u2019s absence would become apparent, and would be a cause for serious concern. The Ceremony would not be disrupted\u2014such a disruption would be unthinkable. But searchers would be sent out into the community.\r\nBy the time his bicycle and clothing were found, The Giver would be returning. Jonas, by then, would be on his own, making his journey Elsewhere.\r\nThe Giver, on his return, would find the community in a state of confusion and panic. Confronted by a situation which they had never faced before, and having no memories from which to find either solace or wisdom, they would not know what to do and would seek his advice.\r\nHe would go to the Auditorium where the people would be gathered, still. He would stride to the stage and command their attention.\r\nHe would make the solemn announcement that Jonas had been lost in the river. He would immediately begin the Ceremony of Loss.\r\n\u201CJonas, Jonas,\u201D they would say loudly, as they had once said the name of Caleb. The Giver would lead the chant. Together they would let Jonas\u2019s presence in their lives fade away as they said his name in unison more slowly, softer and softer, until he was disappearing from them, until he was no more than an occasional murmur and then, by the end of the long day, gone forever, not to be mentioned again.\r\nTheir attention would turn to the overwhelming task of bearing the memories themselves. The Giver would help them.\r\n\u201CYes, I understand that they\u2019ll need you,\u201D Jonas had said at the end of the lengthy discussion and planning. \u201CBut I\u2019ll need you, too. Please come with me.\u201D He knew the answer even as he made the final plea.\r\n\u201CMy work will be finished,\u201D The Giver had replied gently, \u201Cwhen I have helped the community to change and become whole.\r\n\u201CI\u2019m grateful to you, Jonas, because without you I would never have figured out a way to bring about the change. But your role now is to escape. And my role is to stay.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut don\u2019t you\r\nwantto be with me, Giver?\u201D Jonas asked sadly.\r\nThe Giver hugged him. \u201CI love you, Jonas,\u201D he said. \u201CBut I have another place to go. When my work here is finished, I want to be with my daughter.\u201D\r\nJonas had been staring glumly at the floor. Now he looked up, startled. \u201CI didn\u2019t know you had a daughter, Giver! You told me that you\u2019d had a spouse. But I never knew about your daughter.\u201D\r\nThe Giver smiled, and nodded. For the first time in their long months together, Jonas saw him look truly happy.\r\n\u201CHer name was Rosemary,\u201D The Giver said.",

All of it\u2014all the things they had thought through so meticulously\u2014fell apart.\r\nThat night, Jonas was forced to flee. He left the dwelling shortly after the sky became dark and the community still. It was terribly dangerous because some of the work crews were still about, but he moved stealthily and silently, staying in the shadows, making his way past the darkened dwellings and the empty Central Plaza, toward the river. Beyond the Plaza he could see the House of the Old, with the Annex behind it, outlined against the night sky. But he could not stop there. There was no time. Every minute counted now, and every minute must take him farther from the community.\r\nNow he was on the bridge, hunched over on the bicycle, pedaling steadily. He could see the dark, churning water far below.\r\nHe felt, surprisingly, no fear, nor any regret at leaving the community behind. But he felt a very deep sadness that he had left his closest friend behind. He knew that in the danger of his escape he must be absolutely silent; but with his heart and mind, he called back and hoped that with his capacity for hearing-beyond, The Giver would know that Jonas had said goodbye.\r\nIt had happened at the evening meal. The family unit was eating together as always: Lily chattering away, Mother and Father making their customary comments (and lies, Jonas knew) about the day. Nearby, Gabriel played happily on the floor, babbling his baby talk, looking with glee now and then toward Jonas, obviously delighted to have him back after the unexpected night away from the dwelling.\r\nFather glanced down toward the toddler. \u201CEnjoy it, little guy,\u201D he said. \u201CThis is your last night as visitor.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat do you mean?\u201D Jonas asked him.\r\nFather sighed with disappointment. \u201CWell, you know he wasn\u2019t here when you got home this morning because we had him stay overnight at the Nurturing Center. It seemed like a good opportunity, with you gone, to give it a try. He\u2019d been sleeping so soundly.\u201D\r\n\u201CDidn\u2019t it go well?\u201D Mother asked sympathetically.\r\nFather gave a rueful laugh. \u201CThat\u2019s an understatement. It was a disaster. He cried all night, apparently. The night crew couldn\u2019t handle it. They were\r\nreallyfrazzled by the time I got to work.\u201D\r\n\u201CGabe, you naughty thing,\u201D Lily said, with a scolding little cluck toward the grinning toddler on the floor.\r\n\u201CSo,\u201D Father went on, \u201Cwe obviously had to make the decision. Even\r\nIvoted for Gabriel\u2019s release when we had the meeting this afternoon.\u201D\r\nJonas put down his fork and stared at his father. \u201CRelease?\u201D he asked.\r\nFather nodded. \u201CWe certainly gave it our best try, didn\u2019t we?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes, we did,\u201D Mother agreed emphatically.\r\nLily nodded in agreement, too.\r\nJonas worked at keeping his voice absolutely calm. \u201CWhen?\u201D he asked. \u201CWhen will he be released?\u201D\r\n\u201CFirst thing tomorrow morning. We have to start our preparations for the Naming Ceremony, so we thought we\u2019d get this taken care of right away.\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s bye-bye to you, Gabe, in the morning,\u201D Father had said, in his sweet, sing-song voice.\r\nJonas reached the opposite side of the river, stopped briefly, and looked back. The community where his entire life had been lived lay behind him now, sleeping. At dawn, the orderly, disciplined life he had always known would continue again, without him. The life where nothing was ever unexpected. Or inconvenient. Or unusual. The life without color, pain, or past.\r\nHe pushed firmly again at the pedal with his foot and continued riding along the road. It was not safe to spend time looking back. He thought of the rules he had broken so far: enough that if he were caught, now, he would be condemned.\r\nFirst, he had left the dwelling at night. A major transgression.\r\nSecond, he had robbed the community of food: a very serious crime, even though what he had taken was leftovers, set out on the dwelling doorsteps for collection.\r\nThird, he had stolen his father\u2019s bicycle. He had hesitated for a moment, standing beside the bikeport in the darkness, not wanting anything of his father\u2019s and uncertain, as well, whether he could comfortably ride the larger bike when he was so accustomed to his own.\r\nBut it was necessary because it had the child seat attached to the back.\r\nAnd he had taken Gabriel, too.\r\nHe could feel the little head nudge his back, bouncing gently against him as he rode. Gabriel was sleeping soundly, strapped into the seat. Before he had left the dwelling, he had laid his hands firmly on Gabe\u2019s back and transmitted to him the most soothing memory he could: a slow-swinging hammock under palm trees on an island someplace, at evening, with a rhythmic sound of languid water lapping hypnotically against a beach nearby. As the memory seeped from him into the newchild, he could feel Gabe\u2019s sleep ease and deepen. There had been no stir at all when Jonas lifted him from the crib and placed him gently into the molded seat.\r\nHe knew that he had the remaining hours of night before they would be aware of his escape. So he rode hard, steadily, willing himself not to tire as the minutes and miles passed. There had been no time to receive the memories he and The Giver had counted on, of strength and courage. So he relied on what he had, and hoped it would be enough.\r\nHe circled the outlying communities, their dwellings dark. Gradually the distances between communities widened, with longer stretches of empty road. His legs ached at first; then, as time passed, they became numb.\r\nAt dawn Gabriel began to stir. They were in an isolated place; fields on either side of the road were dotted with thickets of trees here and there. He saw a stream, and made his way to it across a rutted, bumpy meadow; Gabriel, wide awake now, giggled as the bicycle jolted him up and down.\r\nJonas unstrapped Gabe, lifted him from the bike, and watched him investigate the grass and twigs with delight. Carefully he hid the bicycle in thick bushes.\r\n\u201CMorning meal, Gabe!\u201D He unwrapped some of the food and fed them both. Then he filled the cup he had brought with water from the stream and held it for Gabriel to drink. He drank thirstily himself, and sat by the stream, watching the newchild play.\r\nHe was exhausted. He knew he must sleep, resting his own muscles and preparing himself for more hours on the bicycle. It would not be safe to travel in daylight.\r\nThey would be looking for him soon.\r\nHe found a place deeply hidden in the trees, took the newchild there, and lay down, holding Gabriel in his arms. Gabe struggled cheerfully as if it were a wrestling game, the kind they had played back in the dwelling, with tickles and laughter.\r\n\u201CSorry, Gabe,\u201D Jonas told him. \u201CI know it\u2019s morning, and I know you just woke up. But we have to sleep now.\u201D\r\nHe cuddled the small body close to him, and rubbed the little back. He murmured to Gabriel soothingly. Then he pressed his hands firmly and transmitted a memory of deep, contented exhaustion. Gabriel\u2019s head nodded, after a moment, and fell against Jonas\u2019s chest.\r\nTogether the fugitives slept through the first dangerous day.\r\nThe most terrifying thing was the planes. By now, days had passed; Jonas no longer knew how many. The journey had become automatic: the sleep by days, hidden in underbrush and trees; the finding of water; the careful division of scraps of food, augmented by what he could find in the fields. And the endless, endless miles on the bicycle by night.\r\nHis leg muscles were taut now. They ached when he settled himself to sleep. But they were stronger, and he stopped now less often to rest. Sometimes he paused and lifted Gabriel down for a brief bit of exercise, running down the road or through a field together in the dark. But always, when he returned, strapped the uncomplaining toddler into the seat again, and remounted, his legs were ready.\r\nSo he had enough strength of his own, and had not needed what The Giver might have provided, had there been time.\r\nBut when the planes came, he wished that he could have received the courage.\r\nHe knew they were search planes. They flew so low that they woke him with the noise of their engines, and sometimes, looking out and up fearfully from the hiding places, he could almost see the faces of the searchers.\r\nHe knew that they could not see color, and that their flesh, as well as Gabriel\u2019s light golden curls, would be no more than smears of gray against the colorless foliage. But he remembered from his science and technology studies at school that the search planes used heat-seeking devices which could identify body warmth and would hone in on two humans huddled in shrubbery.\r\nSo always, when he heard the aircraft sound, he reached to Gabriel and transmitted memories of snow, keeping some for himself. Together they became cold; and when the planes were gone, they would shiver, holding each other, until sleep came again.\r\nSometimes, urging the memories into Gabriel, Jonas felt that they were more shallow, a little weaker than they had been. It was what he had hoped, and what he and The Giver had planned: that as he moved away from the community, he would shed the memories and leave them behind for the people. But now, when he needed them, when the planes came, he tried hard to cling to what he still had, of cold, and to use it for their survival.\r\nUsually the aircraft came by day, when they were hiding. But he was alert at night, too, on the road, always listening intently for the sound of the engines. Even Gabriel listened, and would call out, \u201CPlane! Plane!\u201D sometimes before Jonas had heard the terrifying noise. When the aircraft searchers came, as they did occasionally, during the night as they rode, Jonas sped to the nearest tree or bush, dropped to the ground, and made himself and Gabriel cold. But it was sometimes a frighteningly close call.\r\nAs he pedaled through the nights, through isolated landscape now, with the communities far behind and no sign of human habitation around him or ahead, he was constantly vigilant, looking for the next nearest hiding place should the sound of engines come.\r\nBut the frequency of the planes diminished. They came less often, and flew, when they did come, less slowly, as if the search had become haphazard and no longer hopeful. Finally there was an entire day and night when they did not come at all.",

      "Contents": "Unknown\r\nTwenty-two\r\nN\r\nOW THE LANDSCAPEwas changing. It was a subtle change, hard to identify at first. The road was narrower, and bumpy, apparently no longer tended by road crews. It was harder, suddenly, to balance on the bike, as the front wheel wobbled over stones and ruts.\r\nOne night Jonas fell, when the bike jolted to a sudden stop against a rock. He grabbed instinctively for Gabriel; and the newchild, strapped tightly in his seat, was uninjured, only frightened when the bike fell to its side. But Jonas\u2019s ankle was twisted, and his knees were scraped and raw, blood seeping through his torn trousers. Painfully he righted himself and the bike, and reassured Gabe.\r\nTentatively he began to ride in daylight. He had forgotten the fear of the searchers, who seemed to have diminished into the past. But now there were new fears; the unfamiliar landscape held hidden, unknown perils.\r\nTrees became more numerous, and the forests beside the road were dark and thick with mystery. They saw streams more frequently now and stopped often to drink. Jonas carefully washed his injured knees, wincing as he rubbed at the raw flesh. The constant ache of his swollen ankle was eased when he soaked it occasionally in the cold water that rushed through roadside gullies.\r\nHe was newly aware that Gabriel\u2019s safety depended entirely upon his own continued strength.\r\nThey saw their first waterfall, and for the first time wildlife.\r\n\u201CPlane! Plane!\u201D Gabriel called, and Jonas turned swiftly into the trees, though he had not seen planes in days, and he did not hear an aircraft engine now. When he stopped the bicycle in the shrubbery and turned to grab Gabe, he saw the small chubby arm pointing toward the sky.\r\nTerrified, he looked up, but it was not a plane at all. Though he had never seen one before, he identified it from his fading memories, for The Giver had given them to him often. It was a bird.\r\nSoon there were many birds along the way, soaring overhead, calling. They saw deer; and once, beside the road, looking at them curious and unafraid, a small reddish-brown creature with a thick tail, whose name Jonas did not know. He slowed the bike and they stared at one another until the creature turned away and disappeared into the woods.\r\nAll of it was new to him. After a life of Sameness and predictability, he was awed by the surprises that lay beyond each curve of the road. He slowed the bike again and again to look with wonder at wildflowers, to enjoy the throaty warble of a new bird nearby, or merely to watch the way wind shifted the leaves in the trees. During his twelve years in the community, he had never felt such simple moments of exquisite happiness.\r\nBut there were desperate fears building in him now as well. The most relentless of his new fears was that they would starve. Now that they had left the cultivated fields behind them, it was almost impossible to find food. They finished the meager store of potatoes and carrots they had saved from the last agricultural area, and now they were always hungry.\r\nJonas knelt by a stream and tried without success to catch a fish with his hands. Frustrated, he threw rocks into the water, knowing even as he did so that it was useless. Finally, in desperation, he fashioned a makeshift net, looping the strands of Gabriel\u2019s blanket around a curved stick.\r\nAfter countless tries, the net yielded two flopping silvery fish. Methodically Jonas hacked them to pieces with a sharp rock and fed the raw shreds to himself and to Gabriel. They ate some berries, and tried without success to catch a bird.\r\nAt night, while Gabriel slept beside him, Jonas lay awake, tortured by hunger, and remembered his life in the community where meals were delivered to each dwelling every day.\r\nHe tried to use the flagging power of his memory to recreate meals, and managed brief, tantalizing fragments: banquets with huge roasted meats; birthday parties with thick-frosted cakes; and lush fruits picked and eaten, sun-warmed and dripping, from trees.\r\nBut when the memory glimpses subsided, he was left with the gnawing, painful emptiness. Jonas remembered, suddenly and grimly, the time in his childhood when he had been chastised for misusing a word. The word had been \u201Cstarving.\u201D You have never been starving, he had been told. You will never be starving.\r\nNow he was. If he had stayed in the community, he would not be. It was as simple as that. Once he had yearned for choice. Then, when he had had a choice, he had made the wrong one: the choice to leave. And now he was starving.\r\nBut if he had stayed .\u00A0.\u00A0.\r\nHis thoughts continued. If he had stayed, he would have starved in other ways. He would have lived a life hungry for feelings, for color, for love.\r\nAnd Gabriel? For Gabriel there would have been no life at all. So there had not really been a choice.\r\nIt became a struggle to ride the bicycle as Jonas weakened from lack of food, and realized at the same time that he was encountering something he had for a long time yearned to see: hills. His sprained ankle throbbed as he forced the pedal downward in an effort that was almost beyond him.\r\nAnd the weather was changing. It rained for two days. Jonas had never seen rain, though he had experienced it often in the memories. He had liked those rains, enjoyed the new feeling of it, but this was different. He and Gabriel became cold and wet, and it was hard to get dry, even when sunshine occasionally followed.\r\nGabriel had not cried during the long frightening journey. Now he did. He cried because he was hungry and cold and terribly weak. Jonas cried, too, for the same reasons, and another reason as well. He wept because he was afraid now that he could not save Gabriel. He no longer cared about himself.",

      "Contents": "Unknown\r\nTwenty-three\r\nJ\r\nONAS FELT MOREand more certain that the destination lay ahead of him, very near now in the night that was approaching. None of his senses confirmed it. He saw nothing ahead except the endless ribbon of road unfolding in twisting narrow curves. He heard no sound ahead.\r\nYet he felt it: felt that Elsewhere was not far away. But he had little hope left that he would be able to reach it. His hope diminished further when the sharp, cold air began to blur and thicken with swirling white.\r\nGabriel, wrapped in his inadequate blanket, was hunched, shivering, and silent in his little seat. Jonas stopped the bike wearily, lifted the child down, and realized with heartbreak how cold and weak Gabe had become.\r\nStanding in the freezing mound that was thickening around his numb feet, Jonas opened his own tunic, held Gabriel to his bare chest, and tied the torn and dirty blanket around them both. Gabriel moved feebly against him and whimpered briefly into the silence that surrounded them.\r\nDimly, from a nearly forgotten perception as blurred as the substance itself, Jonas recalled what the whiteness was.\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s called snow, Gabe,\u201D Jonas whispered. \u201C\r\nSnowflakes. They fall down from the sky, and they\u2019re very beautiful.\u201D\r\nThere was no response from the child who had once been so curious and alert. Jonas looked down through the dusk at the little head against his chest. Gabriel\u2019s curly hair was matted and filthy, and there were tearstains outlined in dirt on his pale cheeks. His eyes were closed. As Jonas watched, a snowflake drifted down and was caught briefly for a moment\u2019s sparkle in the tiny fluttering eyelashes.\r\nWearily he remounted the bicycle. A steep hill loomed ahead. In the best of conditions, the hill would have been a difficult, demanding ride. But now the rapidly deepening snow obscured the narrow road and made the ride impossible. His front wheel moved forward imperceptibly as he pushed on the pedals with his numb, exhausted legs. But the bicycle stopped. It would not move.\r\nHe got off and let it drop sideways into the snow. For a moment he thought how easy it would be to drop beside it himself, to let himself and Gabriel slide into the softness of snow, the darkness of night, the warm comfort of sleep.\r\nBut he had come this far. He must try to go on.\r\nThe memories had fallen behind him now, escaping from his protection to return to the people of his community. Were there any left at all? Could he hold onto a last bit of warmth? Did he still have the strength to Give? Could Gabriel still Receive?\r\nHe pressed his hands into Gabriel\u2019s back and tried to remember sunshine. For a moment it seemed that nothing came to him, that his power was completely gone. Then it flickered suddenly, and he felt tiny tongues of heat begin to creep across and into his frozen feet and legs. He felt his face begin to glow and the tense, cold skin of his arms and hands relax. For a fleeting second he felt that he wanted to keep it for himself, to let himself bathe in sunlight, unburdened by anything or anyone else.\r\nBut the moment passed and was followed by an urge, a need, a passionate yearning to share the warmth with the one person left for him to love. Aching from the effort, he forced the memory of warmth into the thin, shivering body in his arms.\r\nGabriel stirred. For a moment they both were bathed in warmth and renewed strength as they stood hugging each other in the blinding snow.\r\nJonas began to walk up the hill.\r\nThe memory was agonizingly brief. He had trudged no more than a few yards through the night when it was gone and they were cold again.\r\nBut his mind was alert now. Warming himself ever so briefly had shaken away the lethargy and resignation and restored his will to survive. He began to walk faster on feet that he could no longer feel. But the hill was treacherously steep; he was impeded by the snow and his own lack of strength. He didn\u2019t make it very far before he stumbled and fell forward.\r\nOn his knees, unable to rise, Jonas tried a second time. His consciousness grasped at a wisp of another warm memory, and tried desperately to hold it there, to enlarge it, and pass it into Gabriel. His spirits and strength lifted with the momentary warmth and he stood. Again, Gabriel stirred against him as he began to climb.\r\nBut the memory faded, leaving him colder than before.\r\nIf only he had had time to receive more warmth from The Giver before he escaped! Maybe there would be more left for him now. But there was no purpose in if-onlys. His entire concentration now had to be on moving his feet, warming Gabriel and himself, and going forward.\r\nHe climbed, stopped, and warmed them both briefly again, with a tiny scrap of memory that seemed certainly to be all he had left.\r\nThe top of the hill seemed so far away, and he did not know what lay beyond. But there was nothing left to do but continue. He trudged upward.\r\nAs he approached the summit of the hill at last, something began to happen. He was not warmer; if anything, he felt more numb and more cold. He was not less exhausted; on the contrary, his steps were leaden, and he could barely move his freezing, tired legs.\r\nBut he began, suddenly, to feel happy. He began to recall happy times. He remembered his parents and his sister. He remembered his friends, Asher and Fiona. He remembered The Giver.\r\nMemories of joy flooded through him suddenly.\r\nHe reached the place where the hill crested and he could feel the ground under his snow-covered feet become level. It would not be uphill anymore.\r\n\u201CWe\u2019re almost there, Gabriel,\u201D he whispered, feeling quite certain without knowing why. \u201CI remember this place, Gabe.\u201D And it was true. But it was not a grasping of a thin and burdensome recollection; this was different. This was something that he could keep. It was a memory of his own.\r\nHe hugged Gabriel and rubbed him briskly, warming him, to keep him alive. The wind was bitterly cold. The snow swirled, blurring his vision. But somewhere ahead, through the blinding storm, he knew there was warmth and light.\r\nUsing his final strength, and a special knowledge that was deep inside him, Jonas found the sled that was waiting for them at the top of the hill. Numbly his hands fumbled for the rope.\r\nHe settled himself on the sled and hugged Gabe close. The hill was steep but the snow was powdery and soft, and he knew that this time there would be no ice, no fall, no pain. Inside his freezing body, his heart surged with hope.\r\nThey started down.\r\nJonas felt himself losing consciousness and with his whole being willed himself to stay upright atop the sled, clutching Gabriel, keeping him safe. The runners sliced through the snow and the wind whipped at his face as they sped in a straight line through an incision that seemed to lead to the final destination, the place that he had always felt was waiting, the Elsewhere that held their future and their past.\r\nHe forced his eyes open as they went downward, downward, sliding, and all at once he could see lights, and he recognized them now. He knew they were shining through the windows of rooms, that they were the red, blue, and yellow lights that twinkled from trees in places where families created and kept memories, where they celebrated love.\r\nDownward, downward, faster and faster. Suddenly he was aware with certainty and joy that below, ahead, they were waiting for him; and that they were waiting, too, for the baby. For the first time, he heard something that he knew to be music. He heard people singing.\r\nBehind him, across vast distances of space and time, from the place he had left, he thought he heard music too. But perhaps it was only an echo.",
