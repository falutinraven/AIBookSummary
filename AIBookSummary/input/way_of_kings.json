      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\nPRELUDE TOTHE STORMLIGHT ARCHIVE\r\nKalak rounded a rocky stone ridge and stumbled to a stop before the body of a dying thunderclast. The enormous stone beast lay on its side, riblike protrusions from its chest broken and cracked. The monstrosity was vaguely skeletal in shape, with unnaturally long limbs that sprouted from granite shoulders. The eyes were deep red spots on the arrowhead face, as if created by a fire burning deep within the stone. They faded.\r\nEven after all these centuries, seeing a thunderclast up close made Kalak shiver. The beast\u2019s hand was as long as a man was tall. He\u2019d been killed by hands like those before, and it hadn\u2019t been pleasant.\r\nOf course, dying rarely was.\r\nHe rounded the creature, picking his way more carefully across the battlefield. The plain was a place of misshapen rock and stone, natural pillars rising around him, bodies littering the ground. Few plants lived here.\r\nThe stone ridges and mounds bore numerous scars. Some were shattered, blasted-out sections where Surgebinders had fought. Less frequently, he passed cracked, oddly shaped hollows where thunderclasts had ripped themselves free of the stone to join the fray.\r\nMany of the bodies around him were human; many were not. Blood mixed. Red. Orange. Violet. Though none of the bodies around him stirred, an indistinct haze of sounds hung in the air. Moans of pain, cries of grief. They did not seem like the sounds of victory. Smoke curled from the occasional patches of growth or heaps of burning corpses. Even some sections of rock smoldered. The Dustbringers had done their work well.\r\nBut I survived,Kalak thought, hand to breast as he hastened to the meeting place.\r\nI actually survived this time.\r\nThat was dangerous. When he died, he was sent back, no choice. When he survived the Desolation, he was supposed to go back as well. Back to that place that he dreaded. Back to that place of pain and fire. What if he just decided\u2026not to go?\r\nPerilous thoughts, perhaps traitorous thoughts. He hastened on his way.\r\nThe place of meeting was in the shadow of a large rock formation, a spire rising into the sky. As always, the ten of them had decided upon it before the battle. The survivors would make their way here. Oddly, only one of the others was waiting for him. Jezrien. Had the other eight all died? It was possible. The battle had been so furious this time, one of the worst. The enemy was growing increasingly tenacious.\r\nBut no. Kalak frowned as he stepped up to the base of the spire. Seven magnificent swords stood proudly here, driven point-first into the stone ground. Each was a masterly work of art, flowing in design, inscribed with glyphs and patterns. He recognized each one. If their masters had died, the Blades would have vanished.\r\nThese Blades were weapons of power beyond even Shardblades. These were unique. Precious. Jezrien stood outside the ring of swords, looking eastward.\r\n\u201CJezrien?\u201D\r\nThe figure in white and blue glanced toward him. Even after all these centuries, Jezrien looked young, like a man barely into his thirtieth year. His short black beard was neatly trimmed, though his once-fine clothing was scorched and stained with blood. He folded his arms behind his back as he turned to Kalak.\r\n\u201CWhat is this, Jezrien?\u201D Kalak asked. \u201CWhere are the others?\u201D\r\n\u201CDeparted.\u201D Jezrien\u2019s voice was calm, deep, regal. Though he hadn\u2019t worn a crown in centuries, his royal manner lingered. He always seemed to know what to do. \u201CYou might call it a miracle. Only one of us died this time.\u201D\r\n\u201CTalenel,\u201D Kalak said. His was the only Blade unaccounted for.\r\n\u201CYes. He died holding that passage by the northern waterway.\u201D\r\nKalak nodded. Taln had a tendency to choose seemingly hopeless fights and win them. He also had a tendency to die in the process. He would be back now, in the place where they went between Desolations. The place of nightmares.\r\nKalak found himself shaking. When had he become so weak? \u201CJezrien, I can\u2019t return this time.\u201D Kalak whispered the words, stepping up and gripping the other man\u2019s arm. \u201CI\r\ncan\u2019t.\u201D\r\nKalak felt something within him break at the admission. How long had it been? Centuries, perhaps millennia, of torture. It was so hard to keep track. Those fires, those hooks, digging into his flesh anew each day. Searing the skin off his arm, then burning the fat, then driving to the bone. He could smell it. Almighty, he could\r\nsmellit!\r\n\u201CLeave your sword,\u201D Jezrien said.\r\n\u201CWhat?\u201D\r\nJezrien nodded to the ring of weapons. \u201CI was chosen to wait for you. We weren\u2019t certain if you had survived. A\u2026a decision has been made. It is time for the Oathpact to end.\u201D\r\nKalak felt a sharp stab of horror. \u201CWhat will that do?\u201D\r\n\u201CIshar believes that so long as there is one of us still bound to the Oathpact, it may be enough. There is a chance we might end the cycle of Desolations.\u201D\r\nKalak looked into the immortal king\u2019s eyes. Black smoke rose from a small patch to their left. Groans of the dying haunted them from behind. There, in Jezrien\u2019s eyes, Kalak saw anguish and grief. Perhaps even cowardice. This was a man hanging from a cliff by a thread.\r\nAlmighty above,Kalak thought.\r\nYou\u2019re broken too, aren\u2019t you?They all were.\r\nKalak turned and walked to the side, where a low ridge overlooked part of the battlefield.\r\nThere were so many corpses, and among them walked the living. Men in primitive wraps, carrying spears topped by bronze heads. Juxtaposed between them were others in gleaming plate armor. One group walked past, four men in their ragged tanned skins or shoddy leather joining a powerful figure in beautiful silver plate, amazingly intricate. Such a contrast.\r\nJezrien stepped up beside him.\r\n\u201CThey see us as divinities,\u201D Kalak whispered. \u201CThey rely upon us, Jezrien. We\u2019re all that they have.\u201D\r\n\u201CThey have the Radiants. That will be enough.\u201D\r\nKalak shook his head. \u201CHe will not remain bound by this. The enemy. He will find a way around it. You know he will.\u201D\r\n\u201CPerhaps.\u201D The king of Heralds offered no further explanation.\r\n\u201CAnd Taln?\u201D Kalak asked.\r\nThe flesh burning. The fires. The pain over and over and over\u2026\r\n\u201CBetter that one man should suffer than ten,\u201D Jezrien whispered. He seemed so cold. Like a shadow caused by heat and light falling on someone honorable and true, casting this black imitation behind.\r\nJezrien walked back to the ring of swords. His own Blade formed in his hands, appearing from mist, wet with condensation. \u201CIt has been decided, Kalak. We will go our ways, and we will not seek out one another. Our Blades must be left. The Oathpact ends now.\u201D He lifted his sword and rammed it into the stone with the other seven.\r\nJezrien hesitated, looking at the sword, then bowed his head and turned away. As if ashamed. \u201CWe chose this burden willingly. Well, we can choose to drop it if we wish.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat do we tell the people, Jezrien?\u201D Kalak asked. \u201CWhat will they say of this day?\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s simple,\u201D Jezrien said, walking away. \u201CWe tell them that they finally won. It\u2019s an easy enough lie. Who knows? Maybe it will turn out to be true.\u201D\r\nKalak watched Jezrien depart across the burned landscape. Finally, he summoned his own Blade and slammed it into the stone beside the other eight. He turned and walked in the direction opposite from Jezrien.\r\nAnd yet, he could not help glancing back at the ring of swords and the single open spot. The place where the tenth sword should have gone.\r\nThe one of them who was lost. The one they had abandoned.\r\nForgive us,Kalak thought, then left."

      "ChapterName": "Prologue: To Kill",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\n\u201CThe love of men is a frigid thing, a mountain stream only three steps from the ice. We are his. Oh Stormfather\u2026we are his. It is but a thousand days, and the Everstorm comes.\u201D\r\n\u2014Collected on the first day of the week Palah of the month Shash of the year 1171, thirty-one seconds before death. Subject was a darkeyed pregnant woman of middle years. The child did not survive.\r\nSzeth-son-son-Vallano, Truthless of Shinovar, wore white on the day he was to kill a king. The white clothing was a Parshendi tradition, foreign to him. But he did as his masters required and did not ask for an explanation.\r\nHe sat in a large stone room, baked by enormous firepits that cast a garish light upon the revelers, causing beads of sweat to form on their skin as they danced, and drank, and yelled, and sang, and clapped. Some fell to the ground red-faced, the revelry too much for them, their stomachs proving to be inferior wineskins. They looked as if they were dead, at least until their friends carried them out of the feast hall to waiting beds.\r\nSzeth did not sway to the drums, drink the sapphire wine, or stand to dance. He sat on a bench at the back, a still servant in white robes. Few at the treaty-signing celebration noticed him. He was just a servant, and Shin were easy to ignore. Most out here in the East thought Szeth\u2019s kind were docile and harmless. They were generally right.\r\nThe drummers began a new rhythm. The beats shook Szeth like a quartet of thumping hearts, pumping waves of invisible blood through the room. Szeth\u2019s masters\u2014who were dismissed as savages by those in more civilized kingdoms\u2014sat at their own tables. They were men with skin of black marbled with red. Parshendi, they were named\u2014cousins to the more docile servant peoples known as parshmen in most of the world. An oddity. They did not call themselves Parshendi; this was the Alethi name for them. It meant, roughly, \u201Cparshmen who can think.\u201D Neither side seemed to see that as an insult.\r\nThe Parshendi had brought the musicians. At first, the Alethi lighteyes had been hesitant. To them, drums were base instruments of the common, darkeyed people. But wine was the great assassin of both tradition and propriety, and now the Alethi elite danced with abandon.\r\nSzeth stood and began to pick his way through the room. The revelry had lasted long; even the king had retired hours ago. But many still celebrated. As he walked, Szeth was forced to step around Dalinar Kholin\u2014the king\u2019s own brother\u2014who slumped drunken at a small table. The aging but powerfully built man kept waving away those who tried to encourage him to bed. Where was Jasnah, the king\u2019s daughter? Elhokar, the king\u2019s son and heir, sat at the high table, ruling the feast in his father\u2019s absence. He was in conversation with two men, a dark-skinned Azish man who had an odd patch of pale skin on his cheek and a thinner, Alethi-looking man who kept glancing over his shoulder.\r\nThe heir\u2019s feasting companions were unimportant. Szeth stayed far from the heir, skirting the sides of the room, passing the drummers. Musicspren zipped through the air around them, the tiny spirits taking the form of spinning translucent ribbons. As Szeth passed the drummers, they noted him. They would withdraw soon, along with all of the other Parshendi.\r\nThey did not seem offended. They did not seem angry. And yet they were going to break their treaty of only a few hours. It made no sense. But Szeth did not ask questions.\r\nAt the edge of the room, he passed rows of unwavering azure lights that bulged out where wall met floor. They held sapphires infused with Stormlight. Profane. How could the men of these lands use something so sacred for mere illumination? Worse, the Alethi scholars were said to be close to creating new Shardblades. Szeth hoped that was just wishful boasting. For if it\r\ndidhappen, the world would be changed. Likely in a way that ended with people in all countries\u2014from distant Thaylenah to towering Jah Keved\u2014speaking Alethi to their children.\r\nThey were a grand people, these Alethi. Even drunk, there was a natural nobility to them. Tall and well made, the men dressed in dark silk coats that buttoned down the sides of the chest and were elaborately embroidered in silver or gold. Each one looked a general on the field.\r\nThe women were even more splendid. They wore grand silk dresses, tightly fitted, the bright colors a contrast to the dark tones favored by the men. The left sleeve of each dress was longer than the right one, covering the hand. Alethi had an odd sense of propriety.\r\nTheir pure black hair was pinned up atop their heads, either in intricate weavings of braids or in loose piles. It was often woven with gold ribbons or ornaments, along with gems that glowed with Stormlight. Beautiful. Profane, but beautiful.\r\nSzeth left the feasting chamber behind. Just outside, he passed the doorway into the Beggars\u2019 Feast. It was an Alethi tradition, a room where some of the poorest men and women in the city were given a feast complementing that of the king and his guests. A man with a long grey and black beard slumped in the doorway, smiling foolishly\u2014though whether from wine or a weak mind, Szeth could not tell.\r\n\u201CHave you seen me?\u201D the man asked with slurred speech. He laughed, then began to speak in gibberish, reaching for a wineskin. So it was drink after all. Szeth brushed by, continuing past a line of statues depicting the Ten Heralds from ancient Vorin theology. Jezerezeh, Ishi, Kelek, Talenelat. He counted off each one, and realized there were only nine here. One was conspicuously missing. Why had Shalash\u2019s statue been removed? King Gavilar was said to be very devout in his Vorin worship. Too devout, by some people\u2019s standards.\r\nThe hallway here curved to the right, running around the perimeter of the domed palace. They were on the king\u2019s floor, two levels up, surrounded by rock walls, ceiling, and floor. That was profane. Stone was not to be trod upon. But what was he to do? He was Truthless. He did as his masters demanded.\r\nToday, that included wearing white. Loose white trousers tied at the waist with a rope, and over them a filmy shirt with long sleeves, open at the front. White clothing for a killer was a tradition among the Parshendi. Although Szeth had not asked, his masters had explained why.\r\nWhite to be bold. White to not blend into the night. White to give warning.\r\nFor if you were going to assassinate a man, he was entitled to see you coming.\r\nSzeth turned right, taking the hallway directly toward the king\u2019s chambers. Torches burned on the walls, their light unsatisfying to him, a meal of thin broth after a long fast. Tiny flamespren danced around them, like insects made solely of congealed light. The torches were useless to him. He reached for his pouch and the spheres it contained, but then hesitated when he saw more of the blue lights ahead: a pair of Stormlight lamps hanging on the wall, brilliant sapphires glowing at their hearts. Szeth walked up to one of these, holding out his hand to cup it around the glass-shrouded gemstone.\r\n\u201CYou there!\u201D a voice called in Alethi. There were two guards at the intersection. Double guard, for there were savages abroad in Kholinar this night. True, those savages were supposed to be allies now. But alliances could be shallow things indeed.\r\nThis one wouldn\u2019t last the hour.\r\nSzeth looked as the two guards approached. They carried spears; they weren\u2019t lighteyes, and were therefore forbidden the sword. Their painted red breastplates were ornate, however, as were their helms. They might be darkeyed, but they were high-ranking citizens with honored positions in the royal guard.\r\nStopping a few feet away, the guard at the front gestured with his spear. \u201CGo on, now. This is no place for you.\u201D He had tan Alethi skin and a thin mustache that ran all the way around his mouth, becoming a beard at the bottom.\r\nSzeth didn\u2019t move.\r\n\u201CWell?\u201D the guard said. \u201CWhat are you waiting for?\u201D\r\nSzeth breathed in deeply, drawing forth the Stormlight. It streamed into him, siphoned from the twin sapphire lamps on the walls, sucked in as if by his deep inhalation. The Stormlight raged inside of him, and the hallway suddenly grew darker, falling into shade like a hilltop cut off from the sun by a transient cloud.\r\nSzeth could feel the Light\u2019s warmth, its fury, like a tempest that had been injected directly into his veins. The power of it was invigorating but dangerous. It pushed him to act. To move. To strike.\r\nHolding his breath, he clung to the Stormlight. He could still feel it leaking out. Stormlight could be held for only a short time, a few minutes at most. It leaked away, the human body too porous a container. He had heard that the Voidbringers could hold it in perfectly. But, then, did they even exist? His punishment declared that they didn\u2019t. His honor demanded that they did.\r\nAfire with holy energy, Szeth turned to the guards. They could see that he was leaking Stormlight, wisps of it curling from his skin like luminescent smoke. The lead guard squinted, frowning. Szeth was sure the man had never seen anything like it before. As far as he knew, Szeth had killed every stonewalker who had ever seen what he could do.\r\n\u201CWhat\u2026what are you?\u201D The guard\u2019s voice had lost its certainty. \u201CSpirit or man?\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat am I?\u201D Szeth whispered, a bit of Light leaking from his lips as he looked past the man down the long hallway. \u201CI\u2019m\u2026sorry.\u201D\r\nSzeth blinked, Lashing himself to that distant point down the hallway. Stormlight raged from him in a flash, chilling his skin, and the ground immediately stopped pulling him downward. Instead, he was pulled toward that distant point\u2014it was as if, to him, that direction had suddenly become\r\ndown.\r\nThis was a Basic Lashing, first of his three kinds of Lashings. It gave him the ability to manipulate whatever force, spren, or god it was that held men to the ground. With this Lashing, he could bind people or objects to different surfaces or in different directions.\r\nFrom Szeth\u2019s perspective, the hallway was now a deep shaft down which he was falling, and the two guards stood on one of the sides. They were shocked when Szeth\u2019s feet hit them, one for each face, throwing them over. Szeth shifted his view and Lashed himself to the floor. Light leaked from him. The floor of the hallway again became\r\ndown, and he landed between the two guards, clothes crackling and dropping flakes of frost. He rose, beginning the process of summoning his Shardblade.\r\nOne of the guards fumbled for his spear. Szeth reached down, touching the soldier\u2019s shoulder while looking up. He focused on a point above him while willing the Light out of his body and into the guard, Lashing the poor man to the ceiling.\r\nThe guard yelped in shock as\r\nupbecame\r\ndownfor him. Light trailing from his form, he crashed into the ceiling and dropped his spear. It was not Lashed directly, and clattered back down to the floor near Szeth.\r\nTo kill. It was the greatest of sins. And yet here Szeth stood, Truthless, profanely walking on stones used for building. And it would not end. As Truthless, there was only one life he was forbidden to take.\r\nAnd that was his own.\r\nAt the tenth beat of his heart, his Shardblade dropped into his waiting hand. It formed as if condensing from mist, water beading along the metal length. His Shardblade was long and thin, edged on both sides, smaller than most others. Szeth swept it out, carving a line in the stone floor and passing through the second guard\u2019s neck.\r\nAs always, the Shardblade killed oddly; though it cut easily through stone, steel, or anything inanimate, the metal fuzzed when it touched living skin. It traveled through the guard\u2019s neck without leaving a mark, but once it did, the man\u2019s eyes smoked and burned. They blackened, shriveling up in his head, and he slumped forward, dead. A Shardblade did not cut living flesh; it severed the soul itself.\r\nAbove, the first guard gasped. He\u2019d managed to get to his feet, even though they were planted on the ceiling of the hallway. \u201CShardbearer!\u201D he shouted. \u201CA Shardbearer assaults the king\u2019s hall! To arms!\u201D\r\nFinally,Szeth thought. Szeth\u2019s use of Stormlight was unfamiliar to the guards, but they knew a Shardblade when they saw one.\r\nSzeth bent down and picked up the spear that had fallen from above. As he did so, he released the breath he\u2019d been holding since drawing in the Stormlight. It sustained him while he held it, but those two lanterns hadn\u2019t contained much of it, so he would need to breathe again soon. The Light began to leak away more quickly, now that he wasn\u2019t holding his breath.\r\nSzeth set the spear\u2019s butt against the stone floor, then looked upward. The guard above stopped shouting, eyes opening wide as the tails of his shirt began to slip downward, the earth below reasserting its dominance. The Light steaming off his body dwindled.\r\nHe looked down at Szeth. Down at the spear tip pointing directly at his heart. Violet fearspren crawled out of the stone ceiling around him.\r\nThe Light ran out. The guard fell.\r\nHe screamed as he hit, the spear impaling him through the chest. Szeth let the spear fall away, carried to the ground with a muffled thump by the body twitching on its end. Shardblade in hand, he turned down a side corridor, following the map he\u2019d memorized. He ducked around a corner and flattened himself against the wall just as a troop of guards reached the dead men. The newcomers began shouting immediately, continuing the alarm.\r\nHis instructions were clear. Kill the king, but be seen doing it. Let the Alethi know he was coming and what he was doing. Why? Why did the Parshendi agree to this treaty, only to send an assassin the very night of its signing?\r\nMore gemstones glowed on the walls of the hallway here. King Gavilar liked lavish display, and he couldn\u2019t know that he was leaving sources of power for Szeth to use in his Lashings. The things Szeth did hadn\u2019t been seen for millennia. Histories from those times were all but nonexistent, and the legends were horribly inaccurate.\r\nSzeth peeked back out into the corridor. One of the guards at the intersection saw him, pointing and yelling. Szeth made sure they got a good look, then ducked away. He took a deep breath as he ran, drawing in Stormlight from the lanterns. His body came alive with it, and his speed increased, his muscles bursting with energy. Light became a storm inside of him; his blood thundered in his ears. It was terrible and wonderful at the same time.\r\nTwo corridors down, one to the side. He threw open the door of a storage room, then hesitated a moment\u2014just long enough for a guard to round the corner and see him\u2014before dashing into the room. Preparing for a Full Lashing, he raised his arm and commanded the Stormlight to pool there, causing the skin to burst alight with radiance. Then he flung his hand out toward the doorframe, spraying white luminescence across it like paint. He slammed the door just as the guards arrived.\r\nThe Stormlight held the door in the frame with the strength of a hundred arms. A Full Lashing bound objects together, holding them fast until the Stormlight ran out. It took longer to create\u2014and drained Stormlight far more quickly\u2014than a Basic Lashing. The door handle shook, and then the wood began to crack as the guards threw their weight against it, one man calling for an axe.\r\nSzeth crossed the room in rapid strides, weaving around the shrouded furniture that had been stored here. It was of red cloth and deep expensive woods. He reached the far wall and\u2014preparing himself for yet another blasphemy\u2014he raised his Shardblade and slashed horizontally through the dark grey stone. The rock sliced easily; a Shardblade could cut any inanimate object. Two vertical slashes followed, then one across the bottom, cutting a large square block. He pressed his hand against it, willing Stormlight into the stone.\r\nBehind him the room\u2019s door began to crack. He looked over his shoulder and focused on the shaking door, Lashing the block in that direction. Frost crystallized on his clothing\u2014Lashing something so large required a great deal of Stormlight. The tempest within him stilled, like a storm reduced to a drizzle.\r\nHe stepped aside. The large stone block shuddered, sliding into the room. Normally, moving the block would have been impossible. Its own weight would have held it against the stones below. Yet now, that same weight pulled it free; for the block, the direction of the room\u2019s door was\r\ndown.With a deep grinding sound, the block slid free of the wall and tumbled through the air, smashing furniture.\r\nThe soldiers finally broke through the door, staggering into the room just as the enormous block crashed into them.\r\nSzeth turned his back on the terrible sound of the screams, the splintering of wood, the breaking of bones. He ducked and stepped through his new hole, entering the hallway outside.\r\nHe walked slowly, drawing Stormlight from the lamps he passed, siphoning it to him and stoking anew the tempest within. As the lamps dimmed, the corridor darkened. A thick wooden door stood at the end, and as he approached, small fearspren\u2014shaped like globs of purple goo\u2014began to wriggle from the masonry, pointing toward the doorway. They were drawn by the terror being felt on the other side.\r\nSzeth pushed the door open, entering the last corridor leading to the king\u2019s chambers. Tall, red ceramic vases lined the pathway, and they were interspersed with nervous soldiers. They flanked a long, narrow rug. It was red, like a river of blood.\r\nThe spearmen in front didn\u2019t wait for him to get close. They broke into a trot, lifting their short throwing spears. Szeth slammed his hand to the side, pushing Stormlight into the doorframe, using the third and final type of Lashing, a Reverse Lashing. This one worked differently from the other two. It did not make the doorframe emit Stormlight; indeed, it seemed to pull nearby light\r\nintoit, giving it a strange penumbra.\r\nThe spearmen threw, and Szeth stood still, hand on the doorframe. A Reverse Lashing required his constant touch, but took comparatively little Stormlight. During one, anything that approached him\u2014particularly lighter objects\u2014was instead pulled toward the Lashing itself.\r\nThe spears veered in the air, splitting around him and slamming into the wooden frame. As he felt them hit, Szeth leaped into the air and Lashed himself to the right wall, his feet hitting the stone with a slap.\r\nHe immediately reoriented his perspective. To his eyes, he wasn\u2019t standing on the wall, the soldiers were, the blood-red carpet streaming between them like a long tapestry. Szeth bolted down the hallway, striking with his Shardblade, shearing through the necks of two men who had thrown spears at him. Their eyes burned, and they collapsed.\r\nThe other guards in the hallway began to panic. Some tried to attack him, others yelled for more help, still others cringed away from him. The attackers had trouble\u2014they were disoriented by the oddity of striking at someone who hung on the wall. Szeth cut down a few, then flipped into the air, tucking into a roll, and Lashed himself back to the floor.\r\nHe hit the ground in the midst of the soldiers. Completely surrounded, but holding a Shardblade.\r\nAccording to legend, the Shardblades were first carried by the Knights Radiant uncounted ages ago. Gifts of their god, granted to allow them to fight horrors of rock and flame, dozens of feet tall, foes whose eyes burned with hatred. The Voidbringers. When your foe had skin as hard as stone itself, steel was useless. Something supernal was required.\r\nSzeth rose from his crouch, loose white clothes rippling, jaw clenched against his sins. He struck out, his weapon flashing with reflected torchlight. Elegant, wide swings. Three of them, one after another. He could neither close his ears to the screams that followed nor avoid seeing the men fall. They dropped round him like toys knocked over by a child\u2019s careless kick. If the Blade touched a man\u2019s spine, he died, eyes burning. If it cut through the core of a limb, it killed that limb. One soldier stumbled away from Szeth, arm flopping uselessly on his shoulder. He would never be able to feel it or use it again.\r\nSzeth lowered his Shardblade, standing among the cinder-eyed corpses. Here, in Alethkar, men often spoke of the legends\u2014of mankind\u2019s hard-won victory over the Voidbringers. But when weapons created to fight nightmares were turned against common soldiers, the lives of men became cheap things indeed.\r\nSzeth turned and continued on his way, slippered feet falling on the soft red rug. The Shardblade, as always, glistened silver and clean. When one killed with a Blade, there was no blood. That seemed like a sign. The Shardblade was just a tool; it could not be blamed for the murders.\r\nThe door at the end of the hallway burst open. Szeth froze as a small group of soldiers rushed out, ushering a man in regal robes, his head ducked as if to avoid arrows. The soldiers wore deep blue, the color of the King\u2019s Guard, and the corpses didn\u2019t make them stop and gawk. They were prepared for what a Shardbearer could do. They opened a side door and shoved their ward through, several leveling spears at Szeth as they backed out.\r\nAnother figure stepped from the king\u2019s quarters; he wore glistening blue armor made of smoothly interlocking plates. Unlike common plate armor, however, this armor had no leather or mail visible at the joints\u2014just smaller plates, fitting together with intricate precision. The armor was beautiful, the blue inlaid with golden bands around the edges of each piece of plate, the helm ornamented with three waves of small, hornlike wings.\r\nShardplate, the customary complement to a Shardblade. The newcomer carried a sword as well, an enormous Shardblade six feet long with a design along the blade like burning flames, a weapon of silvery metal that gleamed and almost seemed to glow. A weapon designed to slay dark gods, a larger counterpart to the one Szeth carried.\r\nSzeth hesitated. He didn\u2019t recognize the armor; he had not been warned that he would be set at this task, and hadn\u2019t been given proper time to memorize the various suits of Plate or Blades owned by the Alethi. But a Shardbearer would have to be dealt with before he chased the king; he could not leave such a foe behind.\r\nBesides, perhaps a Shardbearer could defeat him, kill him and end his miserable life. His Lashings wouldn\u2019t work directly on someone in Shardplate, and the armor would enhance the man, strengthen him. Szeth\u2019s honor would not allow him to betray his mission or seek death. But if that death occurred, he\r\nwouldwelcome it.\r\nThe Shardbearer struck, and Szeth Lashed himself to the side of the hallway, leaping with a twist and landing on the wall. He danced backward, Blade held at the ready. The Shardbearer fell into an aggressive posture, using one of the swordplay stances favored here in the East. He moved far more nimbly than one would expect for a man in such bulky armor. Shardplate was special, as ancient and magical as the Blades it complemented.\r\nThe Shardbearer struck. Szeth skipped to the side and Lashed himself to the ceiling as the Shardbearer\u2019s Blade sliced into the wall. Feeling a thrill at the contest, Szeth dashed forward and attacked downward with an overhand blow, trying to hit the Shardbearer\u2019s helm. The man ducked, going down on one knee, letting Szeth\u2019s Blade cleave empty air.\r\nSzeth leaped backward as the Shardbearer swung upward with his Blade, slicing into the ceiling. Szeth didn\u2019t own a set of Plate himself, and didn\u2019t care to. His Lashings interfered with the gemstones that powered Shardplate, and he had to choose one or the other.\r\nAs the Shardbearer turned, Szeth sprinted forward across the ceiling. As expected, the Shardbearer swung again, and Szeth leaped to the side, rolling. He came up from his roll and flipped, Lashing himself to the floor again. He spun to land on the ground behind the Shardbearer. He slammed his Blade into his opponent\u2019s open back.\r\nUnfortunately, there was one major advantage Plate offered: It could block a Shardblade. Szeth\u2019s weapon hit solidly, causing a web of glowing lines to spread out across the back of the armor, and Stormlight began to leak free from them. Shardplate didn\u2019t dent or bend like common metal. Szeth would have to hit the Shardbearer in the same location at least once more to break through.\r\nSzeth danced out of range as the Shardbearer swung in anger, trying to cut at Szeth\u2019s knees. The tempest within Szeth gave him many advantages\u2014including the ability to quickly recover from small wounds. But it would not restore limbs killed by a Shardblade.\r\nHe rounded the Shardbearer, then picked a moment and dashed forward. The Shardbearer swung again, but Szeth briefly Lashed himself to the ceiling for lift. He shot into the air, cresting over the swing, then immediately Lashed himself back to the floor. He struck as he landed, but the Shardbearer recovered quickly and executed a perfect follow-through stroke, coming within a finger of hitting Szeth.\r\nThe man was dangerously skilled with that Blade. Many Shardbearers depended too much on the power of their weapon and armor. This man was different.\r\nSzeth jumped to the wall and struck at the Shardbearer with quick, terse attacks, like a snapping eel. The Shardbearer fended him off with wide, sweeping counters. His Blade\u2019s length kept Szeth at bay.\r\nThis is taking too long!Szeth thought. If the king slipped away into hiding, Szeth would fail in his mission no matter how many people he killed. He ducked in for another strike, but the Shardbearer forced him back. Each second this fight lasted was another for the king\u2019s escape.\r\nIt was time to be reckless. Szeth launched into the air, Lashing himself to the other end of the hallway and falling feet-first toward his adversary. The Shardbearer didn\u2019t hesitate to swing, but Szeth Lashed himself down at an angle, dropping immediately. The Shardblade swished through the air above him.\r\nHe landed in a crouch, using his momentum to throw himself forward, and swung at the Shardbearer\u2019s side, where the Plate had cracked. He hit with a powerful blow. That piece of the Plate shattered, bits of molten metal streaking away. The Shardbearer grunted, dropping to one knee, raising a hand to his side. Szeth raised a foot to the man\u2019s side and shoved him backward with a Stormlight-enhanced kick.\r\nThe heavy Shardbearer crashed into the door of the king\u2019s quarters, smashing it and falling partway into the room beyond. Szeth left him, ducking instead through the doorway to the right, following the way the king had gone. The hallway here had the same red carpet, and Stormlight lamps on the walls gave Szeth a chance to recharge the tempest within.\r\nEnergy blazed within him again, and he sped up. If he could get far enough ahead, he could deal with the king, then turn back to fight off the Shardbearer. It wouldn\u2019t be easy. A Full Lashing on a doorway wouldn\u2019t stop a Shardbearer, and that Plate would let the man run supernaturally fast. Szeth glanced over his shoulder.\r\nThe Shardbearer wasn\u2019t following. The man sat up in his armor, looking dazed. Szeth could just barely see him, sitting in the doorway, surrounded by broken bits of wood. Perhaps Szeth had wounded him more than he\u2019d thought.\r\nOr maybe\u2026\r\nSzeth froze. He thought of the ducked head of the man who\u2019d been rushed out, face obscured. The Shardbearer\r\nstillwasn\u2019t following. He was so skilled. It was said that few men could rival Gavilar Kholin\u2019s swordsmanship. Could it be?\r\nSzeth turned and dashed back, trusting his instincts. As soon as the Shardbearer saw him, he climbed to his feet with alacrity. Szeth ran faster. What was the safest place for your king? In the hands of some guards, fleeing? Or protected in a suit of Shardplate, left behind, dismissed as a bodyguard?\r\nClever,Szeth thought as the formerly sluggish Shardbearer fell into another battle stance. Szeth attacked with renewed vigor, swinging his Blade in a flurry of strikes. The Shardbearer\u2014the king\u2014aggressively struck out with broad, sweeping blows. Szeth pulled away from one of these, feeling the wind of the weapon passing just inches before him. He timed his next move, then dashed forward, ducking underneath the king\u2019s follow-through.\r\nThe king, expecting another strike at his side, twisted with his arm held protectively to block the hole in his Plate. That gave Szeth the room to run past him and into the king\u2019s chambers.\r\nThe king spun around to follow, but Szeth ran through the lavishly furnished chamber, flinging out his hand, touching pieces of furniture he passed. He infused them with Stormlight, Lashing them to a point behind the king. The furniture tumbled as if the room had been turned on its side, couches, chairs, and tables dropping toward the surprised king. Gavilar made the mistake of chopping at them with his Shardblade. The weapon easily sheared through a large couch, but the pieces still crashed into him, making him stumble. A footstool hit him next, throwing him to the ground.\r\nGavilar rolled out of the way of the furniture and charged forward, Plate leaking streams of Light from the cracked sections. Szeth gathered himself, then leaped into the air, Lashing himself backward and to the right as the king arrived. He zipped out of the way of the king\u2019s blow, then Lashed himself forward with two Basic Lashings in a row. Stormlight flashed out of him, clothing freezing, as he was pulled toward the king at twice the speed of a normal fall.\r\nThe king\u2019s posture indicated surprise as Szeth lurched in midair, then spun toward him, swinging. He slammed his Blade into the king\u2019s helm, then immediately Lashed himself to the ceiling and fell upward, slamming into the stone roof above. He\u2019d Lashed himself in too many directions too quickly, and his body had lost track, making it difficult to land gracefully. He stumbled back to his feet.\r\nBelow, the king stepped back, trying to get into position to swing up at Szeth. The man\u2019s helm was cracked, leaking Stormlight, and he stood protectively, defending the side with the broken plate. The king used a one-handed swing, reaching for the ceiling. Szeth immediately Lashed himself downward, judging that the king\u2019s attack would leave him unable to get his sword back in time.\r\nSzeth underestimated his opponent. The king stepped into Szeth\u2019s attack, trusting his helm to absorb the blow. Just as Szeth hit the helm a second time\u2014shattering it\u2014Gavilar punched with his off hand, slamming his gauntleted fist into Szeth\u2019s face.\r\nBlinding light flashed in Szeth\u2019s eyes, a counterpoint to the sudden agony that crashed across his face. Everything blurred, his vision fading.\r\nPain. So much\r\npain!\r\nHe screamed, Stormlight leaving him in a rush, and he slammed back into something hard. The balcony doors. More pain broke out across his shoulders, as if someone had stabbed him with a hundred daggers, and he hit the ground and rolled to a stop, muscles trembling. The blow would have killed an ordinary man.\r\nNo time for pain. No time for pain. No time for pain!\r\nHe blinked, shaking his head, the world blurry and dark. Was he blind? No. It was dark outside. He was on the wooden balcony; the force of the blow had thrown him through the doors. Something was thumping. Heavy footfalls. The Shardbearer!\r\nSzeth stumbled to his feet, vision swimming. Blood streamed from the side of his face, and Stormlight rose from his skin, blinding his left eye. The Light. It would heal him, if it could. His jaw felt unhinged. Broken? He\u2019d dropped his Shardblade.\r\nA lumbering shadow moved in front of him; the Shardbearer\u2019s armor had leaked enough Stormlight that the king was having trouble walking. But he was coming.\r\nSzeth screamed, kneeling, infusing Stormlight into the wooden balcony, Lashing it downward. The air frosted around him. The tempest roared, traveling down his arms into the wood. He Lashed it downward, then did it again. He Lashed a fourth time as Gavilar stepped onto the balcony. It lurched under the extra weight. The wood cracked, straining.\r\nThe Shardbearer hesitated.\r\nSzeth Lashed the balcony downward a fifth time. The balcony supports shattered and the entire structure broke free from the building. Szeth screamed through a broken jaw and used his final bit of Stormlight to Lash himself to the side of the building. He fell to the side, passing the shocked Shardbearer, then hit the wall and rolled.\r\nThe balcony dropped away, the king looking up with shock as he lost his footing. The fall was brief. In the moonlight, Szeth watched solemnly\u2014vision still fuzzy, blinded in one eye\u2014as the structure crashed to the stone ground below. The wall of the palace trembled, and the crash of broken wood echoed from the nearby buildings.\r\nStill standing on the side of the wall, Szeth groaned, climbing to his feet. He felt weak; he\u2019d used up his Stormlight too quickly, straining his body. He stumbled down the side of the building, approaching the wreckage, barely able to remain standing.\r\nThe king was still moving. Shardplate would protect a man from such a fall, but a large length of bloodied wood stuck up through Gavilar\u2019s side, piercing him where Szeth had broken the Plate earlier. Szeth knelt down, inspecting the man\u2019s pain-wracked face. Strong features, square chin, black beard flecked with white, striking pale green eyes. Gavilar Kholin.\r\n\u201CI\u2026expected you\u2026to come,\u201D the king said between gasps.\r\nSzeth reached underneath the front of the man\u2019s breastplate, tapping the straps there. They unfastened, and he pulled the front of the breastplate free, exposing the gemstones on its interior. Two had been cracked and burned out. Three still glowed. Numb, Szeth breathed in sharply, absorbing the Light.\r\nThe storm began to rage again. More Light rose from the side of his face, repairing his damaged skin and bones. The pain was still great; Stormlight healing was far from instantaneous. It would be hours before he recovered.\r\nThe king coughed. \u201CYou can tell\u2026Thaidakar\u2026that he\u2019s too late\u2026.\u201D\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know who that is,\u201D Szeth said, standing, his words slurring from his broken jaw. He held his hand to the side, resummoning his Shardblade.\r\nThe king frowned. \u201CThen who\u2026? Restares? Sadeas? I never thought\u2026\u201D\r\n\u201CMy masters are the Parshendi,\u201D Szeth said. Ten heartbeats passed, and his Blade dropped into his hand, wet with condensation.\r\n\u201CThe Parshendi? That makes no sense.\u201D Gavilar coughed, hand quivering, reaching toward his chest and fumbling at a pocket. He pulled out a small crystalline sphere tied to a chain. \u201CYou must take this. They must not get it.\u201D He seemed dazed. \u201CTell\u2026tell my brother\u2026he must find the most important words a man can say\u2026.\u201D\r\nGavilar fell still.\r\nSzeth hesitated, then knelt down and took the sphere. It was odd, unlike any he\u2019d seen before. Though it was completely dark, it seemed to glow somehow. With a light that was black.\r\nThe Parshendi?Gavilar had said.\r\nThat makes no sense.\r\n\u201CNothing makes sense anymore,\u201D Szeth whispered, tucking the strange sphere away. \u201CIt\u2019s all unraveling. I am sorry, King of the Alethi. I doubt that you care. Not anymore, at least.\u201D He stood up. \u201CAt least you won\u2019t have to watch the world ending with the rest of us.\u201D\r\nBeside the king\u2019s body, his Shardblade materialized from mist, clattering to the stones now that its master was dead. It was worth a fortune; kingdoms had fallen as men vied to possess a single Shardblade.\r\nShouts of alarm came from inside the palace. Szeth needed to go. But\u2026\r\nTell my brother\u2026\r\nTo Szeth\u2019s people, a dying request was sacred. He took the king\u2019s hand, dipping it in the man\u2019s own blood, then used it to scrawl on the wood,\r\nBrother. You must find the most important words a man can say.\r\nWith that, Szeth escaped into the night. He left the king\u2019s Shardblade; he had no use for it. The Blade Szeth already carried was curse enough."

      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\n\u201CYou\u2019ve killed me. Bastards, you\u2019ve killed me! While the sun is still hot, I die!\u201D\r\n\u2014Collected on the fifth day of the week Chach of the month Betab of the year 1171, ten seconds before death. Subject was a darkeyed soldier thirty-one years of age. Sample is considered questionable.\r\nFIVE YEARS LATER\r\n\u201CI\u2019m going to die, aren\u2019t I?\u201D Cenn asked.\r\nThe weathered veteran beside Cenn turned and inspected him. The veteran wore a full beard, cut short. At the sides, the black hairs were starting to give way to grey.\r\nI\u2019m going to die,Cenn thought, clutching his spear\u2014the shaft slick with sweat.\r\nI\u2019m going to die. Oh, Stormfather. I\u2019m going to die\u2026.\r\n\u201CHow old are you, son?\u201D the veteran asked. Cenn didn\u2019t remember the man\u2019s name. It was hard to recall anything while watching that other army form lines across the rocky battlefield. That lining up seemed so civil. Neat, organized. Shortspears in the front ranks, longspears and javelins next, archers at the sides. The darkeyed spearmen wore equipment like Cenn\u2019s: leather jerkin and knee-length skirt with a simple steel cap and a matching breastplate.\r\nMany of the lighteyes had full suits of armor. They sat astride horses, their honor guards clustering around them with breastplates that gleamed burgundy and deep forest green. Were there Shardbearers among them? Brightlord Amaram wasn\u2019t a Shardbearer. Were any of his men? What if Cenn had to fight one? Ordinary men didn\u2019t kill Shardbearers. It had happened so infrequently that each occurrence was now legendary.\r\nIt\u2019s really happening,he thought with mounting terror. This wasn\u2019t a drill in the camp. This wasn\u2019t training out in the fields, swinging sticks. This was\r\nreal. Facing that fact\u2014his heart pounding like a frightened animal in his chest, his legs unsteady\u2014Cenn suddenly realized that he was a coward. He shouldn\u2019t have left the herds! He should never have\u2014\r\n\u201CSon?\u201D the veteran said, voice firm. \u201CHow old are you?\u201D\r\n\u201CFifteen, sir.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd what\u2019s your name?\u201D\r\n\u201CCenn, sir.\u201D\r\nThe mountainous, bearded man nodded. \u201CI\u2019m Dallet.\u201D\r\n\u201CDallet,\u201D Cenn repeated, still staring out at the other army. There were so many of them! Thousands. \u201CI\u2019m going to die, aren\u2019t I?\u201D\r\n\u201C\r\nNo.\u201D Dallet had a gruff voice, but somehow that was comforting. \u201CYou\u2019re going to be just fine. Keep your head on straight. Stay with the squad.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut I\u2019ve barely had three months\u2019 training!\u201D He swore he could hear faint clangs from the enemy\u2019s armor or shields. \u201CI can barely hold this spear! Stormfather, I\u2019m\r\ndead. I can\u2019t\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CSon,\u201D Dallet interrupted, soft but firm. He raised a hand and placed it on Cenn\u2019s shoulder. The rim of Dallet\u2019s large round shield reflected the light from where it hung on his back. \u201CYou are\r\ngoingto be\r\nfine.\u201D\r\n\u201CHow can you know?\u201D It came out as a plea.\r\n\u201CBecause, lad. You\u2019re in Kaladin Stormblessed\u2019s squad.\u201D The other soldiers nearby nodded in agreement.\r\nBehind them, waves and waves of soldiers were lining up\u2014thousands of them. Cenn was right at the front, with Kaladin\u2019s squad of about thirty other men. Why had Cenn been moved to a new squad at the last moment? It had something to do with camp politics.\r\nWhy was this squad at the very front, where casualties were bound to be the greatest? Small fearspren\u2014like globs of purplish goo\u2014began to climb up out of the ground and gather around his feet. In a moment of sheer panic, he nearly dropped his spear and scrambled away. Dallet\u2019s hand tightened on his shoulder. Looking up into Dallet\u2019s confident black eyes, Cenn hesitated.\r\n\u201CDid you piss before we formed ranks?\u201D Dallet asked.\r\n\u201CI didn\u2019t have time to\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CGo now.\u201D\r\n\u201C\r\nHere?\u201D\r\n\u201CIf you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll end up with it running down your leg in battle, distracting you, maybe killing you. Do it.\u201D\r\nEmbarrassed, Cenn handed Dallet his spear and relieved himself onto the stones. When he finished, he shot glances at those next to him. None of Kaladin\u2019s soldiers smirked. They stood steady, spears to their sides, shields on their backs.\r\nThe enemy army was almost finished. The field between the two forces was bare, flat slickrock, remarkably even and smooth, broken only by occasional rockbuds. It would have made a good pasture. The warm wind blew in Cenn\u2019s face, thick with the watery scents of last night\u2019s highstorm.\r\n\u201CDallet!\u201D a voice said.\r\nA man walked up through the ranks, carrying a shortspear that had two leather knife sheaths strapped to the haft. The newcomer was a young man\u2014perhaps four years older than Cenn\u2019s fifteen\u2014but he was taller by several fingers than even Dallet. He wore the common leathers of a spearman, but under them was a pair of dark trousers. That wasn\u2019t supposed to be allowed.\r\nHis black Alethi hair was shoulder-length and wavy, his eyes a dark brown. He also had knots of white cord on the shoulders of his jerkin, marking him as a squadleader.\r\nThe thirty men around Cenn snapped to attention, raising their spears in salute.\r\nThis is Kaladin Stormblessed?Cenn thought incredulously.\r\nThis youth?\r\n\u201CDallet, we\u2019re soon going to have a new recruit,\u201D Kaladin said. He had a strong voice. \u201CI need you to\u2026\u201D He trailed off as he noticed Cenn.\r\n\u201CHe found his way here just a few minutes ago, sir,\u201D Dallet said with a smile. \u201CI\u2019ve been gettin\u2019 him ready.\u201D\r\n\u201CWell done,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CI paid good money to get that boy away from Gare. That man\u2019s so incompetent he might as well be fighting for the other side.\u201D\r\nWhat?Cenn thought.\r\nWhy would anyonepay\r\nto get me?\r\n\u201CWhat do you think about the field?\u201D Kaladin asked. Several of the other spearmen nearby raised hands to shade from the sun, scanning the rocks.\r\n\u201CThat dip next to the two boulders on the far right?\u201D Dallet asked.\r\nKaladin shook his head. \u201CFooting\u2019s too rough.\u201D\r\n\u201CAye. Perhaps it is. What about the short hill over there? Far enough to avoid the first fall, close enough to not get too far ahead.\u201D\r\nKaladin nodded, though Cenn couldn\u2019t see what they were looking at. \u201CLooks good.\u201D\r\n\u201CThe rest of you louts hear that?\u201D Dallet shouted.\r\nThe men raised their spears high.\r\n\u201CKeep an eye on the new boy, Dallet,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CHe won\u2019t know the signs.\u201D\r\n\u201COf course,\u201D Dallet said, smiling. Smiling! How could the man smile? The enemy army was blowing horns. Did that mean they were ready? Even though Cenn had just relieved himself, he felt a trickle of urine run down his leg.\r\n\u201CStay firm,\u201D Kaladin said, then trotted down the front line to talk to the next squadleader over. Behind Cenn and the others, the dozens of ranks were still growing. The archers on the sides prepared to fire.\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t worry, son,\u201D Dallet said. \u201CWe\u2019ll be fine. Squadleader Kaladin is lucky.\u201D\r\nThe soldier on the other side of Cenn nodded. He was a lanky, red-haired Veden, with darker tan skin than the Alethi. Why was he fighting in an Alethi army? \u201CThat\u2019s right. Kaladin, he\u2019s stormblessed, right sure he is. We only lost\u2026what, one man last battle?\u201D\r\n\u201CBut someone\r\ndiddie,\u201D Cenn said.\r\nDallet shrugged. \u201CPeople always die. Our squad loses the fewest. You\u2019ll see.\u201D\r\nKaladin finished conferring with the other squadleader, then jogged back to his team. Though he carried a shortspear\u2014meant to be wielded one-handed with a shield in the other hand\u2014his was a hand longer than those held by the other men.\r\n\u201CAt the ready, men!\u201D Dallet called. Unlike the other squadleaders, Kaladin didn\u2019t fall into rank, but stood out in front of his squad.\r\nThe men around Cenn shuffled, excited. The sounds were repeated through the vast army, the stillness giving way before eagerness. Hundreds of feet shuffling, shields slapping, clasps clanking. Kaladin remained motionless, staring down the other army. \u201CSteady, men,\u201D he said without turning.\r\nBehind, a lighteyed officer passed on horseback. \u201CBe ready to fight! I want their blood, men. Fight and kill!\u201D\r\n\u201CSteady,\u201D Kaladin said again, after the man passed.\r\n\u201CBe ready to run,\u201D Dallet said to Cenn.\r\n\u201CRun? But we\u2019ve been trained to march in formation! To stay in our line!\u201D\r\n\u201CSure,\u201D Dallet said. \u201CBut most of the men don\u2019t have much more training than you. Those who can fight well end up getting sent to the Shattered Plains to battle the Parshendi. Kaladin\u2019s trying to get us into shape to go there, to fight for the king.\u201D Dallet nodded down the line. \u201CMost of these here will break and charge; the lighteyes aren\u2019t good enough commanders to keep them in formation. So stay with us and run.\u201D\r\n\u201CShould I have my shield out?\u201D Around Kaladin\u2019s team, the other ranks were unhooking their shields. But Kaladin\u2019s squad left their shields on their backs.\r\nBefore Dallet could answer, a horn blew from behind.\r\n\u201CGo!\u201D Dallet said.\r\nCenn didn\u2019t have much choice. The entire army started moving in a clamor of marching boots. As Dallet had predicted, the steady march didn\u2019t last long. Some men began yelling, the roar taken up by others. Lighteyes called for them to go, run, fight. The line disintegrated.\r\nAs soon as that happened, Kaladin\u2019s squad broke into a dash, running out into the front at full speed. Cenn scrambled to keep up, panicked and terrified. The ground wasn\u2019t as smooth as it had seemed, and he nearly tripped on a hidden rockbud, vines withdrawn into its shell.\r\nHe righted himself and kept going, holding his spear in one hand, his shield clapping against his back. The distant army was in motion as well, their soldiers charging down the field. There was no semblance of a battle formation or a careful line. This wasn\u2019t anything like the training had claimed it would be.\r\nCenn didn\u2019t even know who the enemy was. A landlord was encroaching on Brightlord Amaram\u2019s territory\u2014the land owned, ultimately, by Highprince Sadeas. It was a border skirmish, and Cenn thought it was with another Alethi princedom. Why were they fighting each other? Perhaps the king would have put a stop to it, but he was on the Shattered Plains, seeking vengeance for the murder of King Gavilar five years before.\r\nThe enemy had a lot of archers. Cenn\u2019s panic climbed to a peak as the first wave of arrows flew into the air. He stumbled again, itching to take out his shield. But Dallet grabbed his arm and yanked him forward.\r\nHundreds of arrows split the sky, dimming the sun. They arced and fell, dropping like skyeels upon their prey. Amaram\u2019s soldiers raised shields. But not Kaladin\u2019s squad. No shields for them.\r\nCenn screamed.\r\nAnd the arrows slammed into the middle ranks of Amaram\u2019s army, behind him. Cenn glanced over his shoulder, still running. The arrows fell\r\nbehindhim. Soldiers screamed, arrows broke against shields; only a few straggling arrows landed anywhere near the front ranks.\r\n\u201CWhy?\u201D he yelled at Dallet. \u201CHow did you know?\u201D\r\n\u201CThey want the arrows to hit where the men are most crowded,\u201D the large man replied. \u201CWhere they\u2019ll have the greatest chance of finding a body.\u201D\r\nSeveral other groups in the van left their shields lowered, but most ran awkwardly with their shields angled up to the sky, worried about arrows that wouldn\u2019t hit them. That slowed them, and they risked getting trampled by the men behind who\r\nweregetting hit. Cenn itched to raise his shield anyway; it felt so wrong to run without it.\r\nThe second volley hit, and men screamed in pain. Kaladin\u2019s squad barreled toward the enemy soldiers, some of whom were dying to arrows from Amaram\u2019s archers. Cenn could hear the enemy soldiers bellowing war cries, could make out individual faces. Suddenly, Kaladin\u2019s squad pulled to a halt, forming a tight group. They\u2019d reached the small incline that Kaladin and Dallet had chosen earlier.\r\nDallet grabbed Cenn and shoved him to the very center of the formation. Kaladin\u2019s men lowered spears, pulling out shields as the enemy bore down on them. The charging foe used no careful formation; they didn\u2019t keep the ranks of longspears in back and shortspears in front. They all just ran forward, yelling in a frenzy.\r\nCenn scrambled to get his shield unlatched from his back. Clashing spears rang in the air as squads engaged one another. A group of enemy spearmen rushed up to Kaladin\u2019s squad, perhaps coveting the higher ground. The three dozen attackers had some cohesion, though they weren\u2019t in as tight a formation as Kaladin\u2019s squad was.\r\nThe enemy seemed determined to make up for it in passion; they bellowed and screamed in fury, rushing Kaladin\u2019s line. Kaladin\u2019s team held rank, defending Cenn as if he were some lighteyes and they were his honor guard. The two forces met with a crash of metal on wood, shields slamming together. Cenn cringed back.\r\nIt was over in a few eyeblinks. The enemy squad pulled back, leaving two dead on the stone. Kaladin\u2019s team hadn\u2019t lost anyone. They held their bristling V formation, though one man stepped back and pulled out a bandage to wrap a thigh wound. The rest of the men closed in to fill the spot. The wounded man was hulking and thick-armed; he cursed, but the wound didn\u2019t look bad. He was on his feet in a moment, but didn\u2019t return to the place where he\u2019d been. Instead, he moved down to one end of the V formation, a more protected spot.\r\nThe battlefield was chaos. The two armies mingled indistinguishably; sounds of clanging, crunching, and screaming churned in the air. Many of\u00A0the squads broke apart, members rushing from one encounter to another. They moved like hunters, groups of three or four seeking lone individuals, then brutally falling on them.\r\nKaladin\u2019s team held its ground, engaging only enemy squads that got too close. Was this what a battle really was? Cenn\u2019s practice had trained him for long ranks of men, shoulder to shoulder. Not this frenzied intermixing, this brutal pandemonium. Why didn\u2019t more hold formation?\r\nThe real soldiers are all gone,Cenn thought.\r\nOff fighting in a real battle at the Shattered Plains. No wonder Kaladin wants to get his squad there.\r\nSpears flashed on all sides; it was difficult to tell friend from foe, despite the emblems on breastplates and colored paint on shields. The battlefield broke down into hundreds of small groups, like a thousand different wars happening at the same time.\r\nAfter the first few exchanges, Dallet took Cenn by the shoulder and placed him in the rank at the very bottom of the V pattern. Cenn, however, was worthless. When Kaladin\u2019s team engaged enemy squads, all of his training fled him. It took everything he had to just remain there, holding his spear outward and trying to look threatening.\r\nFor the better part of an hour, Kaladin\u2019s squad held their small hill, working as a team, shoulder to shoulder. Kaladin often left his position at the front, rushing this way and that, banging his spear on his shield in a strange rhythm.\r\nThose are signals,Cenn realized as Kaladin\u2019s squad moved from the V shape into a ring. With the screams of the dying and the thousands of men calling to others, it was nearly impossible to hear a single person\u2019s voice. But the sharp clang of the spear against the metal plate on Kaladin\u2019s shield was clear. Each time they changed formations, Dallet grabbed Cenn by the shoulder and steered him.\r\nKaladin\u2019s team didn\u2019t chase down stragglers. They remained on the defensive. And, while several of the men in Kaladin\u2019s team took wounds, none of them fell. Their squad was too intimidating for the smaller groups, and\u00A0larger enemy units retreated after a few exchanges, seeking easier foes.\r\nEventually something changed. Kaladin turned, watching the tides of the battle with discerning brown eyes. He raised his spear and smacked his shield in a quick rhythm he hadn\u2019t used before. Dallet grabbed Cenn by the arm and pulled him away from the small hill. Why abandon it now?\r\nJust then, the larger body of Amaram\u2019s force broke, the men scattering. Cenn hadn\u2019t realized how poorly the battle in this quarter had been going for his side. As Kaladin\u2019s team retreated, they passed many wounded and dying, and Cenn grew nauseated. Soldiers were sliced open, their insides spilling out.\r\nHe didn\u2019t have time for horror; the retreat quickly turned into a rout. Dallet cursed, and Kaladin beat his shield again. The squad changed direction, heading eastward. There, Cenn saw, a larger group of Amaram\u2019s soldiers was holding.\r\nBut the enemy had seen the ranks break, and that made them bold. They rushed forward in clusters, like wild axehounds hunting stray hogs. Before Kaladin\u2019s team was halfway across the field of dead and dying, a large group of enemy soldiers intercepted them. Kaladin reluctantly banged his shield; his squad slowed.\r\nCenn felt his heart begin to thump faster and faster. Nearby, a squad of Amaram\u2019s soldiers was consumed; men stumbled and fell, screaming, trying to get away. The enemies used their spears like skewers, killing men on the ground like cremlings.\r\nKaladin\u2019s men met the enemy in a crash of spears and shields. Bodies shoved on all sides, and Cenn was spun about. In the jumble of friend and foe, dying and killing, Cenn grew overwhelmed. So many men running in so many directions!\r\nHe panicked, scrambling for safety. A group of soldiers nearby wore Alethi uniforms. Kaladin\u2019s squad. Cenn ran for them, but when some turned toward him, Cenn was terrified to realize he didn\u2019t recognize them. This\r\nwasn\u2019tKaladin\u2019s squad, but a small group of unfamiliar soldiers holding an uneven, broken line. Wounded and terrified, they scattered as soon as an enemy squad got close.\r\nCenn froze, holding his spear in a sweaty hand. The enemy soldiers charged right for him. His instincts urged him to flee, yet he had seen so many men picked off one at a time. He had to stand! He had to face them! He couldn\u2019t run, he couldn\u2019t\u2014\r\nHe yelled, stabbing his spear at the lead soldier. The man casually knocked the weapon aside with his shield, then drove his shortspear into Cenn\u2019s thigh. The pain was hot, so hot that the blood squirting out on his leg felt cold by comparison. Cenn gasped.\r\nThe soldier yanked the weapon free. Cenn stumbled backward, dropping his spear and shield. He fell to rocky ground, splashing in someone else\u2019s blood. His foe raised a spear high, a looming silhouette against the stark blue sky, ready to ram it into Cenn\u2019s heart.\r\nAnd then\r\nhewas there.\r\nSquadleader. Stormblessed. Kaladin\u2019s spear came as if out of nowhere, narrowly deflecting the blow that was to have killed Cenn. Kaladin set himself in front of Cenn, alone, facing down six spearmen. He didn\u2019t flinch. He\r\ncharged.\r\nIt happened so quickly. Kaladin swept the feet from beneath the man who had stabbed Cenn. Even as that man fell, Kaladin reached up and flipped a knife from one of the sheaths tied about his spear. His hand snapped, knife flashing and hitting the thigh of a second foe. That man fell to one knee, screaming.\r\nA third man froze, looking at his fallen allies. Kaladin shoved past a wounded enemy and slammed his spear into the gut of the third man. A fourth man fell with a knife to the eye. When had Kaladin grabbed that knife? He spun between the last two, his spear a blur, wielding it like a quarterstaff. For a moment, Cenn thought he could see something surrounding the squadleader. A warping of the air, like the wind itself become visible.\r\nI\u2019ve lost a lot of blood. It\u2019s flowing out so quickly\u2026.\r\nKaladin spun, knocking aside attacks, and the last two spearmen fell with gurgles that Cenn thought sounded surprised. Foes all down, Kaladin turned and knelt beside Cenn. The squadleader set aside his spear and whipped a white strip of cloth from his pocket, then efficiently wrapped it tight around Cenn\u2019s leg. Kaladin worked with the ease of one who had bound wounds dozens of times before.\r\n\u201CKaladin, sir!\u201D Cenn said, pointing at one of the soldiers Kaladin had wounded. The enemy man held his leg as he stumbled to his feet. In a second, however, mountainous Dallet was there, shoving the foe with his shield. Dallet didn\u2019t kill the wounded man, but let him stumble away, unarmed.\r\nThe rest of the squad arrived and formed a ring around Kaladin, Dallet, and Cenn. Kaladin stood up, raising his spear to his shoulder; Dallet handed him back his knives, retrieved from the fallen foes.\r\n\u201CHad me worried there, sir,\u201D Dallet said. \u201CRunning off like that.\u201D\r\n\u201CI knew you\u2019d follow,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CRaise the red banner. Cyn, Korater, you\u2019re going back with the boy. Dallet, hold here. Amaram\u2019s line is bulging in this direction. We should be safe soon.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd you, sir?\u201D Dallet asked.\r\nKaladin looked across the field. A pocket had opened in the enemy forces, and a man rode there on a white horse, swinging about him with a wicked mace. He wore full plate armor, polished and gleaming silver.\r\n\u201CA Shardbearer,\u201D Cenn said.\r\nDallet snorted. \u201CNo, thank the Stormfather. Just a lighteyed officer. Shardbearers are far too valuable to waste on a minor border dispute.\u201D\r\nKaladin watched the lighteyes with a seething hatred. It was the same hatred Cenn\u2019s father had shown when he\u2019d spoken of chull rustlers, or the hatred Cenn\u2019s mother would display when someone mentioned Kusiri, who had run off with the cobbler\u2019s son.\r\n\u201CSir?\u201D Dallet said hesitantly.\r\n\u201CSubsquads Two and Three, pincer pattern,\u201D Kaladin said, his voice hard. \u201CWe\u2019re taking a brightlord off his throne.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou sure that\u2019s wise, sir? We\u2019ve got wounded.\u201D\r\nKaladin turned toward Dallet. \u201CThat\u2019s one of Hallaw\u2019s officers. He might be the one.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou don\u2019t know that, sir.\u201D\r\n\u201CRegardless, he\u2019s a battalionlord. If we kill an officer that high, we\u2019re all but guaranteed to be in the next group sent to the Shattered Plains. We\u2019re taking him.\u201D His eyes grew distant. \u201CImagine it, Dallet. Real soldiers. A warcamp with discipline and lighteyes with integrity. A place where our fighting will\r\nmeansomething.\u201D\r\nDallet sighed, but nodded. Kaladin waved to a group of his soldiers; then they raced across the field. A smaller group of soldiers, including Dallet, waited behind with the wounded. One of those\u2014a thin man with black Alethi hair speckled with a handful of blond hairs, marking some foreign blood\u2014pulled a long red ribbon from his pocket and attached it to his spear. He held the spear aloft, letting the ribbon flap in the wind.\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s a call for runners to carry our wounded off the field,\u201D Dallet said to Cenn. \u201CWe\u2019ll have you out of here soon. You were brave, standing against those six.\u201D\r\n\u201CFleeing seemed stupid,\u201D Cenn said, trying to take his mind off his throbbing leg. \u201CWith so many wounded on the field, how can we think that the runners\u2019ll come for us?\u201D\r\n\u201CSquadleader Kaladin bribes them,\u201D Dallet said. \u201CThey usually only carry off lighteyes, but there are more runners than there are wounded lighteyes. The squadleader puts most of his pay into the bribes.\u201D\r\n\u201CThis squad\r\nisdifferent,\u201D Cenn said, feeling light-headed.\r\n\u201CTold you.\u201D\r\n\u201CNot because of luck. Because of training.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s part of it. Part of it is because we know if we get hurt, Kaladin will get us off the battlefield.\u201D He paused, looking over his shoulder. As Kaladin had predicted, Amaram\u2019s line was surging back, recovering.\r\nThe mounted enemy lighteyes from before was energetically laying about with his mace. A group of his honor guard moved to one side, engaging Kaladin\u2019s subsquads. The lighteyes turned his horse. He wore an open-fronted helm that had sloping sides and a large set of plumes on the top. Cenn couldn\u2019t make out his eye color, but he knew it would be blue or green, maybe yellow or light grey. He was a brightlord, chosen at birth by the Heralds, marked for rule.\r\nHe impassively regarded those who fought nearby. Then one of Kaladin\u2019s knives took him in the right eye.\r\nThe brightlord screamed, falling back off the saddle as Kaladin somehow slipped through the lines and leaped upon him, spear raised.\r\n\u201CAye, it\u2019s part training,\u201D Dallet said, shaking his head. \u201CBut it\u2019s mostly him. He fights like a storm, that one, and thinks twice as fast as other men. The way he moves sometimes\u2026\u201D\r\n\u201CHe bound my leg,\u201D Cenn said, realizing he was beginning to speak nonsense due to the blood loss. Why point out the bound leg? It was a simple thing.\r\nDallet just nodded. \u201CHe knows a lot about wounds. He can read glyphs too. He\u2019s a strange man, for a lowly darkeyed spearman, our squadleader is.\u201D He turned to Cenn. \u201CBut you should save your strength, son. The squadleader won\u2019t be pleased if we lose you, not after what he paid to get you.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhy?\u201D Cenn asked. The battlefield was growing quieter, as if many of the dying men had already yelled themselves hoarse. Almost everyone around them was an ally, but Dallet still watched to make sure no enemy soldiers tried to strike at Kaladin\u2019s wounded.\r\n\u201CWhy, Dallet?\u201D Cenn repeated, feeling urgent. \u201CWhy bring me into his squad? Why\r\nme?\u201D\r\nDallet shook his head. \u201CIt\u2019s just how he is. Hates the thought of young kids like you, barely trained, going to battle. Every now and again, he grabs one and brings him into his squad. A good half dozen of our men were once like you.\u201D Dallet\u2019s eyes got a far-off look. \u201CI think you all remind him of someone.\u201D\r\nCenn glanced at his leg. Painspren\u2014like small orange hands with overly long fingers\u2014were crawling around him, reacting to his agony. They began turning away, scurrying in other directions, seeking other wounded. His pain was fading, his leg\u2014his whole body\u2014feeling numb.\r\nHe leaned back, staring up at the sky. He could hear faint thunder. That was odd. The sky was cloudless.\r\nDallet cursed.\r\nCenn turned, shocked out of his stupor. Galloping directly toward them was a massive black horse bearing a rider in gleaming armor that seemed to radiate light. That armor was seamless\u2014no chain underneath, just smaller plates, incredibly intricate. The figure wore an unornamented full helm, and the plate was gilded. He carried a massive sword in one hand, fully as long as a man was tall. It wasn\u2019t a simple, straight sword\u2014it was curved, and the side that wasn\u2019t sharp was ridged, like flowing waves. Etchings covered its length.\r\nIt was beautiful. Like a work of art. Cenn had never seen a Shardbearer, but he knew immediately what this was. How could he ever have mistaken a simple armored lighteyes for one of\r\nthesemajestic creatures?\r\nHadn\u2019t Dallet claimed there would be no Shardbearers on this battlefield? Dallet scrambled to his feet, calling for the subsquad to form up. Cenn just sat where he was. He couldn\u2019t have stood, not with that leg wound.\r\nHe felt so light-headed. How much blood had he lost? He could barely think.\r\nEither way, he couldn\u2019t fight. You didn\u2019t fight something like this. Sun gleamed against that plate armor. And that gorgeous, intricate, sinuous sword. It was like\u2026like the Almighty himself had taken form to walk the battlefield.\r\nAnd why would you want to fight the Almighty?\r\nCenn closed his eyes."

      "ChapterName": "2: HONOR IS DEAD",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\n\u201CTen orders. We were loved, once. Why have you forsaken us, Almighty! Shard of my soul, where have you gone?\u201D\r\n\u2014Collected on the second day of Kakash, year 1171, five seconds before death. Subject was a lighteyed woman in her third decade.\r\nEIGHT MONTHS LATER\r\nKaladin\u2019s stomach growled as he reached through the bars and accepted the bowl of slop. He pulled the small bowl\u2014more a cup\u2014between the bars, sniffed it, then grimaced as the caged wagon began to roll again. The sludgy grey slop was made from overcooked tallew grain, and this batch was flecked with crusted bits of yesterday\u2019s meal.\r\nRevolting though it was, it was all he would get. He began to eat, legs hanging out between the bars, watching the scenery pass. The other slaves in his cage clutched their bowls protectively, afraid that someone might steal from them. One of them tried to steal Kaladin\u2019s food on the first day. He\u2019d nearly broken the man\u2019s arm. Now everyone left him alone.\r\nSuited him just fine.\r\nHe ate with his fingers, careless of the dirt. He\u2019d stopped noticing dirt months ago. He hated that he felt some of that same paranoia that the others showed. How could he not, after eight months of beatings, deprivation, and brutality?\r\nHe fought down the paranoia. He\r\nwouldn\u2019tbecome like them. Even if he\u2019d given up everything else\u2014even if all had been taken from him, even if there was no longer hope of escape. This one thing he would retain. He was a slave. But he didn\u2019t need to think like one.\r\nHe finished the slop quickly. Nearby, one of the other slaves began to cough weakly. There were ten slaves in the wagon, all men, scraggly-bearded and dirty. It was one of three wagons in their caravan through the Unclaimed Hills.\r\nThe sun blazed reddish white on the horizon, like the hottest part of a smith\u2019s fire. It lit the framing clouds with a spray of color, paint thrown carelessly on a canvas. Covered in tall, monotonously green grass, the hills seemed endless. On a nearby mound, a small figure flitted around the plants, dancing like a fluttering insect. The figure was amorphous, vaguely translucent. Windspren were devious spirits who had a penchant for staying where they weren\u2019t wanted. He\u2019d hoped that this one had gotten bored and left, but as Kaladin tried to toss his wooden bowl aside, he found that it stuck to his fingers.\r\nThe windspren laughed, zipping by, nothing more than a ribbon of light without form. He cursed, tugging on the bowl. Windspren often played pranks like that. He pried at the bowl, and it eventually came free. Grumbling, he tossed it to one of the other slaves. The man quickly began to lick at the remnants of the slop.\r\n\u201CHey,\u201D a voice whispered.\r\nKaladin looked to the side. A slave with dark skin and matted hair was crawling up to him, timid, as if expecting Kaladin to be angry. \u201CYou\u2019re not like the others.\u201D The slave\u2019s black eyes glanced upward, toward Kaladin\u2019s forehead, which bore three brands. The first two made a glyphpair, given to him eight months ago, on his last day in Amaram\u2019s army. The third was fresh, given to him by his most recent master.\r\nShash, the last glyph read. Dangerous.\r\nThe slave had his hand hidden behind his rags. A knife? No, that was ridiculous. None of these slaves could have hidden a weapon; the leaves hidden in Kaladin\u2019s belt were as close as one could get. But old instincts could not be banished easily, so Kaladin watched that hand.\r\n\u201CI heard the guards talking,\u201D the slave continued, shuffling a little closer. He had a twitch that made him blink too frequently. \u201CYou\u2019ve tried to escape before, they said. You\r\nhaveescaped before.\u201D\r\nKaladin made no reply.\r\n\u201CLook,\u201D the slave said, moving his hand out from behind his rags and revealing his bowl of slop. It was half full. \u201CTake me with you next time,\u201D he whispered. \u201CI\u2019ll give you this. Half my food from now until we get away. Please.\u201D As he spoke, he attracted a few hungerspren. They looked like brown flies that flitted around the man\u2019s head, almost too small to see.\r\nKaladin turned away, looking out at the endless hills and their shifting, moving grasses. He rested one arm across the bars and placed his head against it, legs still hanging out.\r\n\u201CWell?\u201D the slave asked.\r\n\u201CYou\u2019re an idiot. If you gave me half your food, you\u2019d be too weak to escape if I\r\nwereto flee. Which I won\u2019t. It doesn\u2019t work.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CTen times,\u201D Kaladin whispered. \u201CTen escape attempts in eight months, fleeing from five different masters. And how many of them worked?\u201D\r\n\u201CWell\u2026I mean\u2026you\u2019re still here\u2026.\u201D\r\nEight months. Eight months as a slave, eight months of slop and beatings. It might as well have been an eternity. He barely remembered the army anymore. \u201CYou can\u2019t hide as a slave,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CNot with that brand on your forehead. Oh, I got away a few times. But they always found me. And then back I went.\u201D\r\nOnce, men had called him lucky. Stormblessed. Those had been lies\u2014if anything, Kaladin had\r\nbadluck. Soldiers were a superstitious sort, and though he\u2019d initially resisted that way of thinking, it was growing harder and harder. Every person he had ever tried to protect had ended up dead. Time and time again. And now, here he was, in an even worse situation than where he\u2019d begun. It was better not to resist. This was his lot, and he was resigned to it.\r\nThere was a certain power in that, a freedom. The freedom of not having to care.\r\nThe slave eventually realized Kaladin wasn\u2019t going to say anything further, and so he retreated, eating his slop. The wagons continued to roll, fields of green extending in all directions. The area around the rattling wagons was bare, however. When they approached, the grass pulled away, each individual stalk withdrawing into a pinprick hole in the stone. After the wagons moved on, the grass timidly poked back out and stretched its blades toward the air. And so, the cages moved along what appeared to be an open rock highway, cleared just for them.\r\nThis far into the Unclaimed Hills, the highstorms were incredibly powerful. The plants had learned to survive. That\u2019s what you had to do, learn to survive. Brace yourself, weather the storm.\r\nKaladin caught a whiff of another sweaty, unwashed body and heard the sound of shuffling feet. He looked suspiciously to the side, expecting that same slave to be back.\r\nIt was a different man this time, though. He had a long black beard stuck with bits of food and snarled with dirt. Kaladin kept his own beard shorter, allowing Tvlakv\u2019s mercenaries to hack it down periodically. Like Kaladin, the slave wore the remains of a brown sack tied with a rag, and he was darkeyed, of course\u2014perhaps a deep dark green, though with darkeyes it was hard to tell. They all looked brown or black unless you caught them in the right light.\r\nThe newcomer cringed away, raising his hands. He had a rash on one hand, the skin just faintly discolored. He\u2019d likely approached because he\u2019d seen Kaladin respond to that other man. The slaves had been frightened of him since the first day, but they were also obviously curious.\r\nKaladin sighed and turned away. The slave hesitantly sat down. \u201CMind if I ask how you became a slave, friend? Can\u2019t help wondering. We\u2019re all wondering.\u201D\r\nJudging by the accent and the dark hair, the man was Alethi, like Kaladin. Most of the slaves were. Kaladin didn\u2019t reply to the question.\r\n\u201CMe, I stole a herd of chull,\u201D the man said. He had a raspy voice, like sheets of paper rubbing together. \u201CIf I\u2019d taken one chull, they might have just beaten me. But a whole herd. Seventeen head\u2026\u201D He chuckled to himself, admiring his own audacity.\r\nIn the far corner of the wagon, someone coughed again. They were a sorry lot, even for slaves. Weak, sickly, underfed. Some, like Kaladin, were repeat runaways\u2014though Kaladin was the only one with a\r\nshashbrand. They were the most worthless of a worthless caste, purchased at a steep discount. They were probably being taken for resale in a remote place where men were desperate for labor. There were plenty of small, independent cities along the coast of the Unclaimed Hills, places where Vorin rules governing the use of slaves were just a distant rumor.\r\nComing this way was dangerous. These lands were ruled by nobody, and by cutting across open land and staying away from established trade routes, Tvlakv could easily run afoul of unemployed mercenaries. Men who had no honor and no fear of slaughtering a slavemaster and his slaves in order to steal a few chulls and wagons.\r\nMen who had no honor. Were there men who\r\nhadhonor?\r\nNo,Kaladin thought.\r\nHonor died eight months ago.\r\n\u201CSo?\u201D asked the scraggly-bearded man. \u201CWhat did you do to get made a slave?\u201D\r\nKaladin raised his arm against the bars again. \u201CHow did you get caught?\u201D\r\n\u201COdd thing, that,\u201D the man said. Kaladin hadn\u2019t answered his question, but he\r\nhadreplied. That seemed enough. \u201CIt was a woman, of course. Should have known she\u2019d sell me.\u201D\r\n\u201CShouldn\u2019t have stolen chulls. Too slow. Horses would have been better.\u201D\r\nThe man laughed riotously. \u201CHorses? What do you think me, a madman? If I\u2019d been caught stealing\r\nthose,I\u2019d have been hanged. Chulls, at least, only earned me a slave\u2019s brand.\u201D\r\nKaladin glanced to the side. This man\u2019s forehead brand was older than Kaladin\u2019s, the skin around the scar faded to white. What was that glyphpair? \u201C\r\nSas morom,\u201D Kaladin said. It was the highlord\u2019s district where the man had originally been branded.\r\nThe man looked up with shock. \u201CHey! You know glyphs?\u201D Several of the slaves nearby stirred at this oddity. \u201CYou must have an even better story than I thought, friend.\u201D\r\nKaladin stared out over those grasses blowing in the mild breeze. Whenever the wind picked up, the more sensitive of the grass stalks shrank down into their burrows, leaving the landscape patchy, like the coat of a sickly horse. That windspren was still there, moving between patches of grass. How long had it been following him? At least a couple of months now. That was downright odd. Maybe it wasn\u2019t the same one. They were impossible to tell apart.\r\n\u201CWell?\u201D the man prodded. \u201CWhy are you here?\u201D\r\n\u201CThere are many reasons why I\u2019m here,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CFailures. Crimes. Betrayals. Probably the same for most every one of us.\u201D\r\nAround him, several of the men grunted in agreement; one of those grunts then degenerated into a hacking cough.\r\nPersistent coughing,a part of\u00A0Kaladin\u2019s mind thought,\r\naccompanied by an excess of phlegm and fevered mumbling at night. Sounds like the grindings.\r\n\u201CWell,\u201D the talkative man said, \u201Cperhaps I should ask a different question. Be more specific, that\u2019s what my mother always said. Say what you mean and ask for what you want. What\u2019s the story of you getting that first brand of yours?\u201D\r\nKaladin sat, feeling the wagon thump and roll beneath him. \u201CI killed a lighteyes.\u201D\r\nHis unnamed companion whistled again, this time even more appreciative than before. \u201CI\u2019m surprised they let you live.\u201D\r\n\u201CKilling the lighteyes isn\u2019t why I was made a slave,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CIt\u2019s the one I\r\ndidn\u2019tkill that\u2019s the problem.\u201D\r\n\u201CHow\u2019s that?\u201D\r\nKaladin shook his head, then stopped answering the talkative man\u2019s questions. The man eventually wandered to the front of the wagon\u2019s cage and sat down, staring at his bare feet.\r\nHours later, Kaladin still sat in his place, idly fingering the glyphs on his forehead. This was his life, day in and day out, riding in these cursed wagons.\r\nHis first brands had healed long ago, but the skin around the\r\nshashbrand was red, irritated, and crusted with scabs. It throbbed, almost like a second heart. It hurt even worse than the burn had when he grabbed the heated handle of a cooking pot as a child.\r\nLessons drilled into Kaladin by his father whispered in the back of his brain, giving the proper way to care for a burn. Apply a salve to prevent infection, wash once daily. Those memories weren\u2019t a comfort; they were an annoyance. He didn\u2019t\r\nhavefourleaf sap or lister\u2019s oil; he didn\u2019t even have water for the washing.\r\nThe parts of the wound that had scabbed over pulled at his skin, making his forehead feel tight. He could barely pass a few minutes without scrunching up his brow and irritating the wound. He\u2019d grown accustomed to reaching up and wiping away the streaks of blood that trickled from the cracks; his right forearm was smeared with it. If he\u2019d had a mirror, he could probably have spotted tiny red rotspren gathering around the wound.\r\nThe sun set in the west, but the wagons kept rolling. Violet Salas peeked over the horizon to the east, seeming hesitant at first, as if making sure the sun had vanished. It was a clear night, and the stars shivered high above. Taln\u2019s Scar\u2014a swath of deep red stars that stood out vibrantly from the twinkling white ones\u2014was high in the sky this season.\r\nThat slave who\u2019d been coughing earlier was at it again. A ragged, wet cough. Once, Kaladin would have been quick to go help, but something within him had changed. So many people he\u2019d tried to help were now dead. It seemed to him\u2014irrationally\u2014that the man would be better off without his interference. After failing Tien, then Dallet and his team, then ten successive groups of slaves, it was hard to find the will to try again.\r\nTwo hours past First Moon, Tvlakv finally called a halt. His two brutish mercenaries climbed from their places atop their wagons, then moved to build a small fire. Lanky Taran\u2014the serving boy\u2014tended the chulls. The large crustaceans were nearly as big as wagons themselves. They settled down, pulling into their shells for the night with clawfuls of grain. Soon they were nothing more than three lumps in the darkness, barely distinguishable from boulders. Finally, Tvlakv began checking on the slaves one at a time, giving each a ladle of water, making certain his investments were healthy. Or, at least, as healthy as could be expected for this poor lot.\r\nTvlakv started with the first wagon, and Kaladin\u2014still sitting\u2014pushed his fingers into his makeshift belt, checking on the leaves he\u2019d hidden there. They crackled satisfactorily, the stiff, dried husks rough against his skin. He still wasn\u2019t certain what he was going to do with them. He\u2019d grabbed them on a whim during one of the sessions when he\u2019d been allowed out of the wagon to stretch his legs. He doubted anyone else in the caravan knew how to recognize blackbane\u2014narrow leaves on a trefoil prong\u2014so it hadn\u2019t been too much of a risk.\r\nAbsently, he took the leaves out and rubbed them between forefinger and palm. They had to dry before reaching their potency. Why did he carry them? Did he mean to give them to Tvlakv and get revenge? Or were they a contingency, to be retained in case things got too bad, too unbearable?\r\nSurely I haven\u2019t fallen that far,he thought. It was just more likely his instinct of securing a weapon when he saw one, no matter how unusual. The landscape was dark. Salas was the smallest and dimmest of the moons, and while her violet coloring had inspired countless poets, she didn\u2019t do much to help you see your hand in front of your face.\r\n\u201COh!\u201D a soft, feminine voice said. \u201CWhat\u2019s that?\u201D\r\nA translucent figure\u2014just a handspan tall\u2014peeked up from over the edge of the floor near Kaladin. She climbed up and into the wagon, as if scaling some high plateau. The windspren had taken the shape of a young woman\u2014larger spren could change shapes and sizes\u2014with an angular face and long, flowing hair that faded into mist behind her head. She\u2014Kaladin couldn\u2019t help but think of the windspren as a she\u2014was formed of pale blues and whites and wore a simple, flowing white dress of a girlish cut that came down to midcalf. Like the hair, it faded to mist at the very bottom. Her feet, hands, and face were crisply distinct, and she had the hips and bust of a slender woman.\r\nKaladin frowned at the spirit. Spren were all around; you just ignored them most of the time. But this one was an oddity. The windspren walked upward, as if climbing an invisible staircase. She reached a height where she could stare at Kaladin\u2019s hand, so he closed his fingers around the black leaves. She walked around his fist in a circle. Although she glowed like an afterimage from looking at the sun, her form provided no real illumination.\r\nShe bent down, looking at his hand from different angles, like a child expecting to find a hidden piece of candy. \u201CWhat is it?\u201D Her voice was like a whisper. \u201CYou can show me. I won\u2019t tell anyone. Is it a treasure? Have you cut off a piece of the night\u2019s cloak and tucked it away? Is it the heart of a beetle, so tiny yet powerful?\u201D\r\nHe said nothing, causing the spren to pout. She floated up, hovering though she had no wings, and looked him in the eyes. \u201CKaladin, why must you ignore me?\u201D\r\nKaladin started. \u201CWhat did you say?\u201D\r\nShe smiled mischievously, then sprang away, her figure blurring into a long white ribbon of blue-white light. She shot between the bars\u2014twisting and warping in the air, like a strip of cloth caught in the wind\u2014and darted beneath the wagon.\r\n\u201CStorm you!\u201D Kaladin said, leaping to his feet. \u201CSpirit! What did you say? Repeat that!\u201D Spren didn\u2019t use people\u2019s names. Spren weren\u2019t intelligent. The larger ones\u2014like windspren or riverspren\u2014could mimic voices and expressions, but they didn\u2019t actually think. They didn\u2019t\u2026\r\n\u201CDid any of you hear that?\u201D Kaladin asked, turning to the cage\u2019s other occupants. The roof was just high enough to let Kaladin stand. The others were lying back, waiting to get their ladle of water. He got no response beyond a few mutters to be quiet and some coughs from the sick man in the corner. Even Kaladin\u2019s \u201Cfriend\u201D from earlier ignored him. The man had fallen into a stupor, staring at his feet, wiggling his toes periodically.\r\nMaybe they hadn\u2019t seen the spren. Many of the larger ones were invisible except to the person they were tormenting. Kaladin sat back down to floor of the wagon, hanging his legs outside. The windspren\r\nhadsaid his name, but undoubtedly she\u2019d just repeated what she\u2019d heard before. But\u2026none of the men in the cage knew his name.\r\nMaybe I\u2019m going mad,Kaladin thought.\r\nSeeing things that aren\u2019t there. Hearing voices.\r\nHe took a deep breath, then opened his hand. His grip had cracked and broken the leaves. He\u2019d need to tuck them away to prevent further\u2014\r\n\u201CThose leaves look interesting,\u201D said that same feminine voice. \u201CYou like them a lot, don\u2019t you?\u201D\r\nKaladin jumped, twisting to the side. The windspren stood in the air just beside his head, white dress rippling in a wind Kaladin couldn\u2019t feel.\r\n\u201CHow do you know my name?\u201D he demanded.\r\nThe windspren didn\u2019t answer. She walked on air over to the bars, then poked her head out, watching Tvlakv the slaver administer drinks to the last few slaves in the first wagon. She looked back at Kaladin. \u201CWhy don\u2019t you fight? You did before. Now you\u2019ve stopped.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhy do you care, spirit?\u201D\r\nShe cocked her head. \u201CI don\u2019t know,\u201D she said, as if surprised at herself. \u201CBut I do. Isn\u2019t that odd?\u201D\r\nIt was more than odd. What did he make of a spren that not only used his name, but seemed to\r\nrememberthings he had done weeks ago?\r\n\u201CPeople don\u2019t eat leaves, you know, Kaladin,\u201D she said, folding translucent arms. Then she cocked her head. \u201COr do you? I can\u2019t remember. You\u2019re so strange, stuffing some things into your mouths, leaking out other things when you don\u2019t think anyone is looking.\u201D\r\n\u201CHow do you know my name?\u201D he whispered.\r\n\u201CHow do\r\nyouknow it?\u201D\r\n\u201CI know it because\u2026because it\u2019s mine. My parents told it to me. I don\u2019t know.\u201D\r\n\u201CWell I don\u2019t either,\u201D she said, nodding as if she\u2019d just won some grand argument.\r\n\u201CFine,\u201D he said. \u201CBut why are you\r\nusingmy name?\u201D\r\n\u201CBecause it\u2019s polite. And you are\r\nimpolite.\u201D\r\n\u201CSpren don\u2019t know what that means!\u201D\r\n\u201CSee, there,\u201D she said, pointing at him. \u201CImpolite.\u201D\r\nKaladin blinked. Well, he was far from where he\u2019d grown up, walking foreign stone and eating foreign food. Perhaps the spren who lived here were different from those back home.\r\n\u201CSo why don\u2019t you fight?\u201D she asked, flitting down to rest on his legs, looking up at his face. She had no weight that he could feel.\r\n\u201CI can\u2019t fight,\u201D he said softly.\r\n\u201CYou did before.\u201D\r\nHe closed his eyes and rested his head forward against the bars. \u201CI\u2019m so tired.\u201D He didn\u2019t mean the physical fatigue, though eight months eating leftovers had stolen much of the lean strength he\u2019d cultivated while at war. He\r\nfelttired. Even when he got enough sleep. Even on those rare days when he wasn\u2019t hungry, cold, or stiff from a beating. So tired\u2026\r\n\u201CYou have been tired before.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve failed, spirit,\u201D he replied, squeezing his eyes shut. \u201CMust you torment me so?\u201D\r\nThey were all dead. Cenn and Dallet, and before that Tukks and the Takers. Before that, Tien. Before that, blood on his hands and the corpse of a young girl with pale skin.\r\nSome of the slaves nearby muttered, likely thinking he was mad. Anyone could end up drawing a spren, but you learned early that talking to one was pointless.\r\nWashe mad? Perhaps he should wish for that\u2014madness was an escape from the pain. Instead, it terrified him.\r\nHe opened his eyes. Tvlakv was finally waddling up to Kaladin\u2019s wagon with his bucket of water. The portly, brown-eyed man walked with a very faint limp; the result of a broken leg, perhaps. He was Thaylen, and all Thaylen men had the same stark white beards\u2014regardless of their age or the color of the hair on their heads\u2014and white eyebrows. Those eyebrows grew very long, and the Thaylen wore them pushed back over the ears. That made him appear to have two white streaks in his otherwise black hair.\r\nHis clothing\u2014striped trousers of black and red with a dark blue sweater that matched the color of his knit cap\u2014had once been fine, but it was now growing ragged. Had he once been something other than a slaver? This life\u2014the casual buying and selling of human flesh\u2014seemed to have an effect on men. It wearied the soul, even if it did fill one\u2019s money pouch.\r\nTvlakv kept his distance from Kaladin, carrying his oil lantern over to inspect the coughing slave at the front of the cage. Tvlakv called to his mercenaries. Bluth\u2014Kaladin didn\u2019t know why he\u2019d bothered to learn their names\u2014wandered over. Tvlakv spoke quietly, pointing at the slave. Bluth nodded, slablike face shadowed in the lanternlight, and pulled the cudgel free from his belt.\r\nThe windspren took the form of a white ribbon, then zipped over toward the sick man. She spun and twisted a few times before landing on the floor, becoming a girl again. She leaned in to inspect the man. Like a curious child.\r\nKaladin turned away and closed his eyes, but he could still hear the coughing. Inside his mind, his father\u2019s voice responded.\r\nTo cure the grinding coughs,said the careful, precise tone,\r\nadminister two handfuls of bloodivy, crushed to a powder, each day. If you don\u2019t have that, be certain to give the patient plenty of liquids, preferably with sugar stirred in. As long as the patient stays hydrated, he will most likely survive. The disease sounds far worse than it is.\r\nMost likely survive\u2026\r\nThose coughs continued. Someone unlatched the cage door. Would they know how to help the man? Such an easy solution. Give him water, and he would live.\r\nIt didn\u2019t matter. Best not to get involved.\r\nMen dying on the battlefield. A youthful face, so familiar and dear, looking to Kaladin for salvation. A sword wound slicing open the side of a neck. A Shardbearer charging through Amaram\u2019s ranks.\r\nBlood. Death. Failure. Pain.\r\nAnd his father\u2019s voice.\r\nCan you really leave him, son? Let him die when you could have helped?\r\nStorm it!\r\n\u201CStop!\u201D Kaladin yelled, standing.\r\nThe other slaves scrambled back. Bluth jumped up, slamming the cage door closed and holding up his cudgel. Tvlakv shied behind the mercenary, using him as cover.\r\nKaladin took a deep breath, closing his hand around the leaves and then raising the other to his head, wiping away a smear of blood. He crossed the small cage, bare feet thumping on the wood. Bluth glared as Kaladin knelt beside the sick man. The flickering light illuminated a long, drawn face and nearly bloodless lips. The man had coughed up phlegm; it was greenish and solid. Kaladin felt the man\u2019s neck for swelling, then checked his dark brown eyes.\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s called the grinding coughs,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CHe will live, if you give him an extra ladle of water every two hours for five days or so. You\u2019ll have to force it down his throat. Mix in sugar, if you have any.\u201D\r\nBluth scratched at his ample chin, then glanced at the shorter slaver.\r\n\u201CPull him out,\u201D Tvlakv said.\r\nThe wounded slave awoke as Bluth unlocked the cage. The mercenary waved Kaladin back with his cudgel, and Kaladin reluctantly withdrew. After putting away his cudgel, Bluth grabbed the slave under the arms and dragged him out, all the while trying to keep a nervous eye on Kaladin. Kaladin\u2019s last failed escape attempt had involved twenty armed slaves. His master should have executed him for that, but he had claimed Kaladin was \u201Cintriguing\u201D and branded him with\r\nshash, then sold him for a pittance.\r\nThere always seemed to be a reason Kaladin survived when those he\u2019d tried to help died. Some men might have seen that as a blessing, but he saw it as an ironic kind of torment. He\u2019d spent some time under his previous master speaking with a slave from the West, a Selay man who had spoken of the Old Magic from their legends and its ability to curse people. Could that be what was happening to Kaladin?\r\nDon\u2019t be foolish,he told himself.\r\nThe cage door snapped back in place, locking. The cages were necessary\u2014Tvlakv had to protect his fragile investment from the highstorms. The cages had wooden sides that could be pulled up and locked into place during the furious gales.\r\nBluth dragged the slave over to the fire, beside the unpacked water barrel. Kaladin felt himself relax.\r\nThere,he told himself.\r\nPerhaps you can still help. Perhaps there\u2019s a reason to care.\r\nKaladin opened his hand and looked down at the crumbled black leaves in his palm. He didn\u2019t need these. Sneaking them into Tvlakv\u2019s drink would not only be difficult, but pointless. Did he really want the slaver dead? What would that accomplish?\r\nA low crack rang in the air, followed by a second one, duller, like someone dropping a bag of grain. Kaladin snapped his head up, looking to where Bluth had deposited the sick slave. The mercenary raised his cudgel one more time, then snapped it down, the weapon making a cracking sound as it hit the slave\u2019s skull.\r\nThe slave hadn\u2019t uttered a cry of pain or protest. His corpse slumped over in the darkness; Bluth casually picked it up and slung it over his shoulder.\r\n\u201CNo!\u201D Kaladin yelled, leaping across the cage and slamming his hands against the bars.\r\nTvlakv stood warming himself by the fire.\r\n\u201CStorm you!\u201D Kaladin screamed. \u201CHe could have lived, you bastard!\u201D\r\nTvlakv glanced at him. Then, leisurely, the slaver walked over, straightening his deep blue knit cap. \u201CHe would have gotten you all sick, you see.\u201D His voice was lightly accented, smashing words together, not giving the proper syllables emphasis. Thaylens always sounded to Kaladin like they were mumbling. \u201CI would not lose an entire wagon for one man.\u201D\r\n\u201CHe\u2019s past the spreading stage!\u201D Kaladin said, slamming his hands against the bars again. \u201CIf any of us were going to catch it, we\u2019d have done so by now.\u201D\r\n\u201CHope that you don\u2019t. I think he was past saving.\u201D\r\n\u201CI told you otherwise!\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd I should believe you, deserter?\u201D Tvlakv said, amused. \u201CA man with eyes that smolder and hate? You would kill me.\u201D He shrugged. \u201CI care not. So long as you are strong when it is time for sales. You should bless me for saving you from that man\u2019s sickness.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll bless your cairn when I pile it up myself,\u201D Kaladin replied.\r\nTvlakv smiled, walking back toward the fire. \u201CKeep that fury, deserter, and that strength. It will pay me well on our arrival.\u201D\r\nNot if you don\u2019t live that long,Kaladin thought. Tvlakv always warmed the last of the water from the bucket he used for the slaves. He\u2019d make himself tea from it, hanging it over the fire. If Kaladin made sure he was watered last, then powdered the leaves and dropped them into the\u2014\r\nKaladin froze, then looked down at his hands. In his haste, he\u2019d forgotten that he\u2019d been holding the blackbane. He\u2019d dropped the flakes as he slammed his hands against the bars. Only a few bits stuck to his palms, not enough to be potent.\r\nHe spun to look backward; the floor of the cage was dirty and covered with grime. If the flakes had fallen there, there was no way to collect them. The wind gathered suddenly, blowing dust, crumbs, and dirt out of the wagon and into the night.\r\nEven in this, Kaladin failed.\r\nHe sank down, his back to the bars, and bowed his head. Defeated. That cursed windspren kept darting around him, looking confused."

      "ChapterName": "3: CITY OF BELLS",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\n\u201CA man stood on a cliffside and watched his homeland fall into dust. The waters surged beneath, so far beneath. And he heard a child crying. They were his own tears.\u201D\r\n\u2014Collected on the 4th of Tanates, year 1171, thirty seconds before death. Subject was a cobbler of some renown.\r\nKharbranth, City of Bells, was not a place that Shallan had ever imagined she would visit. Though she\u2019d often dreamed of traveling, she\u2019d expected to spend her early life sequestered in her family\u2019s manor, only escaping through the books of her father\u2019s library. She\u2019d expected to marry one of her father\u2019s allies, then spend the rest of her life sequestered in\r\nhismanor.\r\nBut expectations were like fine pottery. The harder you held them, the more likely they were to crack.\r\nShe found herself breathless, clutching her leather-bound drawing pad to her chest as longshoremen pulled the ship into the dock. Kharbranth was enormous. Built up the side of a steep incline, the city was wedge-shaped, as if it were built into a wide crack, with the open side toward the ocean. The buildings were blocky, with square windows, and appeared to have been constructed of some kind of mud or daub. Crem, perhaps? They were painted bright colors, reds and oranges most often, but occasional blues and yellows too.\r\nShe could hear the bells already, tinkling in the wind, ringing with pure voices. She had to strain her neck to look up toward the city\u2019s loftiest rim; Kharbranth was like a mountain towering over her. How many people lived in a place like this? Thousands? Tens of thousands? She shivered again\u2014daunted yet excited\u2014then blinked pointedly, fixing the image of the city in her memory.\r\nSailors rushed about. The\r\nWind\u2019s Pleasurewas a narrow, single-masted vessel, barely large enough for her, the captain, his wife, and the half-dozen crew. It had seemed so small at first, but Captain Tozbek was a calm and cautious man, an excellent sailor, even if he was a pagan. He\u2019d guided the ship with care along the coast, always finding a sheltered cove to ride out highstorms.\r\nThe captain oversaw the work as the men secured the mooring. Tozbek was a short man, even-shouldered with Shallan, and he wore his long white Thaylen eyebrows up in a curious spiked pattern. It was like he had two waving fans above his eyes, a foot long each. He wore a simple knit cap and a silver-buttoned black coat. She\u2019d imagined him getting that scar on his jaw in a furious sea battle with pirates. The day before, she\u2019d been disappointed to hear it had been caused by loose tackle during rough weather.\r\nHis wife, Ashlv, was already walking down the gangplank to register their vessel. The captain saw Shallan inspecting him, and so walked over. He was a business connection of her family\u2019s, long trusted by her father. That was good, since the plan she and her brothers had concocted had contained no place for her bringing along a lady-in-waiting or nurse.\r\nThat plan made Shallan nervous. Very,\r\nverynervous. She hated being duplicitous. But the financial state of her house\u2026They either needed a spectacular infusion of wealth or some other edge in local Veden house politics. Otherwise, they wouldn\u2019t last the year.\r\nFirst things first,Shallan thought, forcing herself to be calm.\r\nFind Jasnah Kholin. Assuming she hasn\u2019t moved off without you again.\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve sent a lad on your behalf, Brightness,\u201D Tozbek said. \u201CIf the princess is still here, we shall soon know.\u201D\r\nShallan nodded gratefully, still clutching her drawing pad. Out in the city, there were people\r\neverywhere. Some wore familiar clothing\u2014trousers and shirts that laced up the front for the men, skirts and colorful blouses for the women. Those could have been from her homeland, Jah Keved. But Kharbranth was a free city. A small, politically fragile city-state, it held little territory but had docks open to all ships that passed, and it asked no questions about nationality or status. People flowed to it.\r\nThat meant many of the people she saw were exotic. Those single-sheet wraps would mark a man or woman from Tashikk, far to the west. The long coats, enveloping down to the ankles, but open in the front like cloaks\u2026where were those from? She\u2019d rarely seen so many parshmen as she noted working the docks, carrying cargo on their backs. Like the parshmen her father had owned, these were stout and thick of limb, with their odd marbled skin\u2014some parts pale or black, others a deep crimson. The mottled pattern was unique to each individual.\r\nAfter chasing Jasnah Kholin from town to town for the better part of six months, Shallan was beginning to think she\u2019d never catch the woman. Was the princess avoiding her? No, that didn\u2019t seem likely\u2014Shallan just wasn\u2019t important enough to wait for. Brightness Jasnah Kholin was one of the most powerful women in the world. And one of the most infamous. She was the only member of a faithful royal house who was a professed heretic.\r\nShallan tried not to grow anxious. Most likely, they\u2019d discover that Jasnah had moved on again. The\r\nWind\u2019s Pleasurewould dock for the night, and Shallan would negotiate a price with the captain\u2014steeply discounted, because of her family\u2019s investments in Tozbek\u2019s shipping business\u2014to take her to the next port.\r\nAlready, they were months past the time when Tozbek had expected to be rid of her. She\u2019d never sensed resentment from him; his honor and loyalty kept him agreeing to her requests. However, his patience wouldn\u2019t last forever, and neither would her money. She\u2019d already used over half the spheres she\u2019d brought with her. He wouldn\u2019t abandon her in an unfamiliar city, of course, but he might regretfully insist on taking her back to Vedenar.\r\n\u201CCaptain!\u201D a sailor said, rushing up the gangplank. He wore only a vest and loose, baggy trousers, and had the darkly tanned skin of one who worked in the sun. \u201CNo message, sir. Dock registrar says that Jasnah hasn\u2019t left yet.\u201D\r\n\u201CHa!\u201D the captain said, turning to Shallan. \u201CThe hunt is over!\u201D\r\n\u201CBless the Heralds,\u201D Shallan said softly.\r\nThe captain smiled, flamboyant eyebrows looking like streaks of light coming from his eyes. \u201CIt must be your beautiful face that brought us this favorable wind! The windspren themselves were entranced by you, Brightness Shallan, and led us here!\u201D\r\nShallan blushed, considering a response that wasn\u2019t particularly proper.\r\n\u201CAh!\u201D the captain said, pointing at her. \u201CI can see you have a reply\u2014I see it in your eyes, young miss! Spit it out. Words aren\u2019t meant to be kept inside, you see. They are free creatures, and if locked away will unsettle the stomach.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s not polite,\u201D Shallan protested.\r\nTozbek bellowed a laugh. \u201CMonths of travel, and still you claim that! I keep telling you that we\u2019re sailors! We forgot how to be polite the moment we set first foot on a ship; we\u2019re far beyond redemption now.\u201D\r\nShe smiled. She\u2019d been trained by stern nurses and tutors to hold her tongue\u2014unfortunately, her brothers had been even more determined in encouraging her to do the opposite. She\u2019d made a habit of entertaining them with witty comments when nobody else was near. She thought fondly of hours spent by the crackling greatroom hearth, the younger three of her four brothers huddled around her, listening as she made sport of their father\u2019s newest sycophant or a traveling ardent. She\u2019d often fabricated silly versions of conversations to fill the mouths of people they could see, but not hear.\r\nThat had established in her what her nurses had referred to as an \u201Cinsolent streak.\u201D And the sailors were even more appreciative of a witty comment than her brothers had been.\r\n\u201CWell,\u201D Shallan said to the captain, blushing but still eager to speak, \u201CI was just thinking this: You say that my beauty coaxed the winds to deliver us to Kharbranth with haste. But wouldn\u2019t that imply that on other trips, my lack of beauty was to blame for us arriving late?\u201D\r\n\u201CWell\u2026er\u2026\u201D\r\n\u201CSo in reality,\u201D Shallan said, \u201Cyou\u2019re telling me I\u2019m beautiful precisely one-sixth of the time.\u201D\r\n\u201CNonsense! Young miss, you\u2019re like a morning sunrise, you are!\u201D\r\n\u201CLike a sunrise? By that you mean entirely too crimson\u201D\u2014she pulled at her long red hair\u2014\u201Cand prone to making men grouchy when they see me?\u201D\r\nHe laughed, and several of the sailors nearby joined in. \u201CAll right then,\u201D Captain Tozbek said, \u201Cyou\u2019re like a flower.\u201D\r\nShe grimaced. \u201CI\u2019m allergic to flowers.\u201D\r\nHe raised an eyebrow.\r\n\u201CNo, really,\u201D she admitted. \u201CI think they\u2019re quite captivating. But if you were to give me a bouquet, you\u2019d soon find me in a fit so energetic that it would have you searching the walls for stray freckles I might have blown free with the force of my sneezes.\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, be that true, I still say you\u2019re as\r\nprettyas a flower.\u201D\r\n\u201CIf I am, then young men my age must be afflicted with the same allergy\u2014for they keep their distance from me noticeably.\u201D She winced. \u201CNow, see, I told you this wasn\u2019t polite. Young women should not act in such an irritable way.\u201D\r\n\u201CAh, young miss,\u201D the captain said, tipping his knit cap toward her. \u201CThe lads and I will miss your clever tongue. I\u2019m not sure what we\u2019ll do without you.\u201D\r\n\u201CSail, likely,\u201D she said. \u201CAnd eat, and sing, and watch the waves. All the things you do now, only you shall have rather\r\nmoretime to accomplish all of it, as you won\u2019t be stumbling across a youthful girl as she sits on your deck sketching and mumbling to herself. But you have my thanks, Captain, for a trip that was wonderful\u2014if somewhat exaggerated in length.\u201D\r\nHe tipped his cap to her in acknowledgment.\r\nShallan grinned\u2014she hadn\u2019t expected being out on her own to be so liberating. Her brothers had worried that she\u2019d be frightened. They saw her as timid because she didn\u2019t like to argue and remained quiet when large groups were talking. And perhaps she\r\nwastimid\u2014being away from Jah Keved was daunting. But it was also wonderful. She\u2019d filled three sketchbooks with pictures of the creatures and people she\u2019d seen, and while her worry over her house\u2019s finances was a perpetual cloud, it was balanced by the sheer delight of experience.\r\nTozbek began making dock arrangements for his ship. He was a good man. As for his praise of her supposed beauty, she took that for what it was. A kind, if overstated, mark of affection. She was pale-skinned in an era when Alethi tan was seen as the mark of true beauty, and though she had light blue eyes, her impure family line was manifest in her auburn-red hair. Not a single lock of proper black. Her freckles had faded as she reached young womanhood\u2014Heralds be blessed\u2014but there were still some visible, dusting her cheeks and nose.\r\n\u201CYoung miss,\u201D the captain said to her after conferring with his men, \u201CYour Brightness Jasnah, she\u2019ll undoubtedly be at the Conclave, you see.\u201D\r\n\u201COh, where the Palanaeum is?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes, yes. And the king lives there too. It\u2019s the center of the city, so to speak. Except it\u2019s on the top.\u201D He scratched his chin. \u201CWell, anyway, Brightness Jasnah Kholin is sister to a king; she will stay nowhere else, not in Kharbranth. Yalb here will show you the way. We can deliver your trunk later.\u201D\r\n\u201CMany thanks, Captain,\u201D she said. \u201C\r\nShaylor mkabat nour.\u201D\r\nThe winds have brought us safely.A phrase of thanks in the Thaylen language.\r\nThe captain smiled broadly. \u201C\r\nMkai bade fortenthis!\u201D\r\nShe had no idea what that meant. Her Thaylen was quite good when she was reading, but hearing it spoken was something else entirely. She smiled at him, which seemed the proper response, for he laughed, gesturing to one of his sailors.\r\n\u201CWe\u2019ll wait here in this dock for two days,\u201D he told her. \u201CThere is a highstorm coming tomorrow, you see, so we cannot leave. If the situation with the Brightness Jasnah does not proceed as hoped, we\u2019ll take you back to Jah Keved.\u201D\r\n\u201CThank you again.\u201D\r\n\u201C\u2019Tis nothing, young miss,\u201D he said. \u201CNothing but what we\u2019d be doing anyway. We can take on goods here and all. Besides, that\u2019s a right nice likeness of my wife you gave me for my cabin. Right nice.\u201D\r\nHe strode over to Yalb, giving him instructions. Shallan waited, putting her drawing pad back into her leather portfolio. Yalb. The name was difficult for her Veden tongue to pronounce. Why were the Thaylens so fond of mashing letters together, without proper vowels?\r\nYalb waved for her. She moved to follow.\r\n\u201CBe careful with yourself, lass,\u201D the captain warned as she passed. \u201CEven a safe city like Kharbranth hides dangers. Keep your wits about you.\u201D\r\n\u201CI should think I\u2019d prefer my wits inside my skull, Captain,\u201D she replied, carefully stepping onto the gangplank. \u201CIf I keep them \u2018about me\u2019 instead, then someone has gotten entirely too close to my head with a cudgel.\u201D\r\nThe captain laughed, waving her farewell as she made her way down the gangplank, holding the railing with her freehand. Like all Vorin women, she kept her left hand\u2014her safehand\u2014covered, exposing only her freehand. Common darkeyed women would wear a glove, but a woman of her rank was expected to show more modesty than that. In her case, she kept her safehand covered by the oversized cuff of her left sleeve, which was buttoned closed.\r\nThe dress was of a traditional Vorin cut, formfitting through the bust, shoulders, and waist, with a flowing skirt below. It was blue silk with chull-shell buttons up the sides, and she carried her satchel by pressing it to her chest with her safehand while holding the railing with her freehand.\r\nShe stepped off the gangplank into the furious activity of the docks, messengers running this way and that, women in red coats tracking cargos on ledgers. Kharbranth was a Vorin kingdom, like Alethkar and like Shallan\u2019s own Jah Keved. They weren\u2019t pagans here, and writing was a feminine art; men learned only glyphs, leaving letters and reading to their wives and sisters.\r\nShe hadn\u2019t asked, but she was certain Captain Tozbek could read. She\u2019d seen him holding books; it had made her uncomfortable. Reading was an unseemly trait in a man. At least, men who weren\u2019t ardents.\r\n\u201CYou wanna ride?\u201D Yalb asked her, his rural Thaylen dialect so thick she could barely make out the words.\r\n\u201CYes, please.\u201D\r\nHe nodded and rushed off, leaving her on the docks, surrounded by a group of parshmen who were laboriously moving wooden crates from one pier to another. Parshmen were thick-witted, but they made excellent workers. Never complaining, always doing as they were told. Her father had preferred them to regular slaves.\r\nWere the Alethi really fighting\r\nparshmenout on the Shattered Plains? That seemed so odd to Shallan. Parshmen didn\u2019t fight. They were docile and practically mute. Of course, from what she\u2019d heard, the ones out on the Shattered Plains\u2014the Parshendi, they were called\u2014were physically different from regular parshmen. Stronger, taller, keener of mind. Perhaps they weren\u2019t really parshmen at all, but distant relatives of some kind.\r\nTo her surprise, she could see signs of animal life all around the docks. A few skyeels undulated through the air, searching for rats or fish. Tiny crabs hid between cracks in the dock\u2019s boards, and a cluster of haspers clung to the dock\u2019s thick logs. In a street inland of the docks, a prowling mink skulked in the shadows, watching for morsels that might be dropped.\r\nShe couldn\u2019t resist pulling open her portfolio and beginning a sketch of a pouncing skyeel. Wasn\u2019t it afraid of all the people? She held her sketchpad with her safehand, hidden fingers wrapping around the top as she used a charcoal pencil to draw. Before she was finished, her guide returned with a man pulling a curious contraption with two large wheels and a canopy-covered seat. She hesitantly lowered her sketchpad. She\u2019d expected a palanquin.\r\nThe man pulling the machine was short and dark-skinned, with a wide smile and full lips. He gestured for Shallan to sit, and she did so with the modest grace her nurses had drilled into her. The driver asked her a question in a clipped, terse-sounding language she didn\u2019t recognize.\r\n\u201CWhat was that?\u201D she asked Yalb.\r\n\u201CHe wants to know if you\u2019d like to be pulled the long way or the short way.\u201D Yalb scratched his head. \u201CI\u2019m not right sure what the difference is.\u201D\r\n\u201CI suspect one takes longer,\u201D Shallan said.\r\n\u201COh, you\r\narea clever one.\u201D Yalb said something to the porter in that same clipped language, and the man responded.\r\n\u201CThe long way gives a good view of the city,\u201D Yalb said. \u201CThe short way goes straight up to the Conclave. Not many good views, he says. I guess he noticed you were new to the city.\u201D\r\n\u201CDo I stand out that much?\u201D Shallan asked, flushing.\r\n\u201CEh, no, of course not, Brightness.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd by that you mean that I\u2019m as obvious as a wart on a queen\u2019s nose.\u201D\r\nYalb laughed. \u201CAfraid so. But you can\u2019t go someplace a second time until you been there a first time, I reckon. Everyone has to stand out sometime, so you might as well do it in a pretty way like yourself!\u201D\r\nShe\u2019d had to get used to gentle flirtation from the sailors. They were never too forward, and she suspected the captain\u2019s wife had spoken to them sternly when she\u2019d noticed how it made Shallan blush. Back at her father\u2019s manor, servants\u2014even those who had been full citizens\u2014had been afraid to step out of their places.\r\nThe porter was still waiting for an answer. \u201CThe short way, please,\u201D she told Yalb, though she longed to take the scenic path. She was finally in a\r\nrealcity and she took the direct route? But Brightness Jasnah had proven to be as elusive as a wild songling. Best to be quick.\r\nThe main roadway cut up the hillside in switchbacks, and so even the short way gave her time to see much of the city. It proved intoxicatingly rich with strange people, sights, and ringing bells. Shallan sat back and took it all in. Buildings were grouped by color, and that color seemed to indicate purpose. Shops selling the same items would be painted the same shades\u2014violet for clothing, green for foods. Homes had their own pattern, though Shallan couldn\u2019t interpret it. The colors were soft, with a washed-out, subdued tonality.\r\nYalb walked alongside her cart, and the porter began to talk back toward her. Yalb translated, hands in the pockets of his vest. \u201CHe says that the city is special because of the lait here.\u201D\r\nShallan nodded. Many cities were built in laits\u2014areas protected from the highstorms by nearby rock formations.\r\n\u201CKharbranth is one of the most sheltered major cities in the world,\u201D Yalb continued, translating, \u201Cand the bells are a symbol of that. It\u2019s said they were first erected to warn that a highstorm was blowing, since the winds were so soft that people didn\u2019t always notice.\u201D Yalb hesitated. \u201CHe\u2019s just saying things because he wants a big tip, Brightness. I\u2019ve heard that story, but I think it\u2019s blustering ridiculous. If the winds blew strong enough to move bells, then people\u2019d notice. Besides, people didn\u2019t notice it was\r\nrainingon their blustering heads?\u201D\r\nShallan smiled. \u201CIt\u2019s all right. He can continue.\u201D\r\nThe porter chatted on in his clipped voice\u2014what language\r\nwasthat, anyway? Shallan listened to Yalb\u2019s translation, drinking in the sights, sounds, and\u2014unfortunately\u2014scents. She\u2019d grown up accustomed to the crisp smell of freshly dusted furniture and flatbread baking in the kitchens. Her ocean journey had taught her new scents, of brine and clean sea air.\r\nThere was nothing clean in what she smelled here. Each passing alleyway had its own unique array of revolting stenches. These alternated with the spicy scents of street vendors and their foods, and the juxtaposition was even more nauseating. Fortunately, her porter moved into the central part of the roadway, and the stenches abated, though it did slow them as they had to contend with thicker traffic. She gawked at those they passed. Those men with gloved hands and faintly bluish skin were from Natanatan. But who were those tall, stately people dressed in robes of black? And the men with their beards bound in cords, making them rodlike?\r\nThe sounds put Shallan in mind of the competing choruses of wild songlings near her home, only multiplied in variety and volume. A hundred voices called to one another, mingling with doors slamming, wheels rolling on stone, occasional skyeels crying. The ever-present bells tinkled in the background, louder when the wind blew. They were displayed in the windows of shops, hung from rafters. Each lantern pole along the street had a bell hung under the lamp, and her cart had a small silvery one at the very tip of its canopy. When she was about halfway up the hillside, a rolling wave of loud clock bells rang the hour. The varied, unsynchronized chimes made a clangorous din.\r\nThe crowds thinned as they reached the upper quarter of the city, and eventually her porter pulled her to a massive building at the very apex of the city. Painted white, it was carved from the rock face itself, rather than built of bricks or clay. The pillars out front grew seamlessly from the stone, and the back side of the building melded smoothly into the cliff. The outcroppings of roof had squat domes atop them, and were painted in metallic colors. Lighteyed women passed in and out, carrying scribing utensils and wearing dresses like Shallan\u2019s, their left hands properly cuffed. The men entering or leaving the building wore military-style Vorin coats and stiff trousers, buttons up the sides and ending in a stiff collar that wrapped the entire neck. Many carried swords at their waists, the belts wrapping around the knee-length coats.\r\nThe porter stopped and made a comment to Yalb. The sailor began arguing with him, hands on hips. Shallan smiled at his stern expression, and she blinked pointedly, affixing the scene in her memory for later sketching.\r\n\u201CHe\u2019s offering to split the difference with me if I let him inflate the price of the trip,\u201D Yalb said, shaking his head and offering a hand to help Shallan from the cart. She stepped down, looking at the porter, who shrugged, smiling like a child who had been caught sneaking sweets.\r\nShe clutched her satchel with her cuffed arm, searching through it with her freehand for her money pouch. \u201CHow much should I actually give him?\u201D\r\n\u201CTwo clearchips should be more than enough. I\u2019d have offered one. The thief wanted to ask for\r\nfive.\u201D\r\nBefore this trip, she\u2019d never used money; she\u2019d just admired the spheres for their beauty. Each one was composed of a glass bead a little larger than a person\u2019s thumbnail with a much smaller gemstone set at the center. The gemstones could absorb Stormlight, and that made the spheres glow. When she opened the money pouch, shards of ruby, emerald, diamond, and sapphire shone out on her face. She fished out three diamond chips, the smallest denomination. Emeralds were the most valuable, for they could be used by Soulcasters to create food.\r\nThe glass part of most spheres was the same size; the size of the gemstone at the center determined the denomination. The three chips, for instance, each had only a tiny splinter of diamond inside. Even that was enough to glow with Stormlight, far fainter than a lamp, but still visible. A mark\u2014the medium denomination of sphere\u2014was a little less bright than a candle, and it took five chips to make a mark.\r\nShe\u2019d brought only infused spheres, as she\u2019d heard that dun ones were considered suspect, and sometimes a moneylender would have to be brought in to judge the authenticity of the gemstone. She kept the most valuable spheres she had in her safepouch, of course, which was buttoned to the inside of her left sleeve.\r\nShe handed the three chips to Yalb, who cocked his head. She nodded at the porter, blushing, realizing that she\u2019d reflexively used Yalb like a master-servant intermediary. Would he be offended?\r\nHe laughed and stood up stiffly, as if imitating a master-servant, paying the porter with a mock stern expression. The porter laughed, bowed to Shallan, then pulled his cart away.\r\n\u201CThis is for you,\u201D Shallan said, taking out a ruby mark and handing it to Yalb.\r\n\u201CBrightness, this is too much!\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s partially out of thanks,\u201D she said, \u201Cbut is also to pay you to stay here and wait for a few hours, in case I return.\u201D\r\n\u201CWait a few hours for a firemark? That\u2019s wages for a week\u2019s sailing!\u201D\r\n\u201CThen it should be enough to make certain you don\u2019t wander off.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll be right here!\u201D Yalb said, giving her an elaborate bow that was surprisingly well-executed.\r\nShallan took a deep breath and strode up the steps toward the Conclave\u2019s imposing entrance. The carved rock really was remarkable\u2014the artist in her wanted to linger and study it, but she didn\u2019t dare. Entering the large building was like being swallowed. The hallway inside was lined with Stormlight lamps that shone with white light. Diamond broams were probably set inside them; most buildings of fine construction used Stormlight to provide illumination. A broam\u2014the highest denomination of sphere\u2014glowed with about the same light as several candles.\r\nTheir light shone evenly and softly on the many attendants, scribes, and lighteyes moving through the hallway. The building appeared to be constructed as one broad, high, and long tunnel, burrowed into the rock. Grand chambers lined the sides, and subsidiary corridors branched off the central grand promenade. She felt far more comfortable than she had outdoors. This place\u2014with its bustling servants, its lesser brightlords and brightladies\u2014was familiar.\r\nShe raised her freehand in a sign of need, and sure enough, a master-servant in a crisp white shirt and black trousers hurried over to her. \u201CBrightness?\u201D he asked, speaking her native Veden, likely because of the color of her hair.\r\n\u201CI seek Jasnah Kholin,\u201D Shallan said. \u201CI have word that she is within these walls.\u201D\r\nThe master-servant bowed crisply. Most master-servants prided themselves on their refined service\u2014the very same air that Yalb had been mocking moments ago. \u201CI shall return, Brightness.\u201D He would be of the second nahn, a darkeyed citizen of very high rank. In Vorin belief, one\u2019s Calling\u2014the task to which one dedicated one\u2019s life\u2014was of vital importance. Choosing a good profession and working hard at it was the best way to ensure good placement in the afterlife. The specific devotary that one visited for worship often had to do with the nature of one\u2019s chosen Calling.\r\nShallan folded her arms, waiting. She had thought long about her own Calling. The obvious choice was her art, and she did so love sketching. But it was more than just the drawing that attracted her\u2014it was the\r\nstudy, the questions raised by observation. Why weren\u2019t the skyeels afraid of people? What did haspers feed on? Why did a rat population thrive in one area, but fail in another? So she\u2019d chosen natural history instead.\r\nShe longed to be a true scholar, to receive real instruction, to spend time on deep research and study. Was that part of why she\u2019d suggested this daring plan of seeking out Jasnah and becoming her ward? Perhaps. However, she needed to remain focused. Becoming Jasnah\u2019s ward\u2014and therefore student\u2014was only one step.\r\nShe considered this as she idly walked up to a pillar, using her freehand to feel the polished stone. Like much of Roshar\u2014save for certain coastal regions\u2014Kharbranth was built on raw, unbroken stone. The buildings outside had been set directly on the rock, and this one sliced into it. The pillar was granite, she guessed, though her geological knowledge was sketchy.\r\nThe floor was covered with long, burnt-orange rugs. The material was dense, designed to look rich but bear heavy traffic. The broad, rectangular hallway had an\r\noldfeel to it. One book she\u2019d read claimed that Kharbranth had been founded way back into the shadowdays, years before the Last Desolation. That would make it old indeed. Thousands of years old, created before the terrors of the Hierocracy, long before\u2014even\u2014the Recreance. Back when Voidbringers with bodies of stone were said to have stalked the land.\r\n\u201CBrightness?\u201D a voice asked.\r\nShallan turned to find that the servant had returned.\r\n\u201CThis way, Brightness.\u201D\r\nShe nodded to the servant, and he led her quickly down the busy hallway. She went over how to present herself to Jasnah. The woman was a legend. Even Shallan\u2014living in the remote estates of Jah Keved\u2014had heard of the Alethi king\u2019s brilliant, heretic sister. Jasnah was only thirty-four years old, yet many felt she would already have obtained the cap of a master scholar if it weren\u2019t for her vocal denunciations of religion. Most specifically, she denounced the devotaries, the various religious congregations that proper Vorin people joined.\r\nImproper quips would not serve Shallan well here. She would have to be proper. Wardship to a woman of great renown was the best way to be schooled in the feminine arts: music, painting, writing, logic, and science. It was much like how a young man would train in the honor guard of a brightlord he respected.\r\nShallan had originally written to Jasnah requesting a wardship in desperation; she hadn\u2019t actually expected the woman to reply in the affirmative. When she had\u2014via a letter commanding Shallan to attend her in Dumadari in two weeks\u2014Shallan had been shocked. She\u2019d been chasing the woman ever since.\r\nJasnah was a heretic. Would she demand that Shallan renounce her faith? She doubted she could do such a thing. Vorin teachings regarding one\u2019s Glory and Calling had been one of her few refuges during the difficult days, when her father had been at his worst.\r\nThey turned into a narrower hallway, entering corridors increasingly far from the main cavern. Finally, the master-servant stopped at a corner and gestured for Shallan to continue. There were voices coming from the corridor to the right.\r\nShallan hesitated. Sometimes, she wondered how it had come to this. She was the quiet one, the timid one, the youngest of five siblings and the only girl. Sheltered, protected all her life. And now the hopes of her entire house rested on her shoulders.\r\nTheir father was dead. And it was vital that remain a secret.\r\nShe didn\u2019t like to think of that day\u2014she all but blocked it from her mind, and trained herself to think of other things. But the effects of his loss could not be ignored. He had made many promises\u2014some business deals, some bribes, some of the latter disguised as the former. House Davar owed great amounts of money to a great number of people, and without her father to keep them all appeased, the creditors would soon begin making demands.\r\nThere was nobody to turn to. Her family, mostly because of her father, was loathed even by its allies. Highprince Valam\u2014the brightlord to whom her family gave fealty\u2014was ailing, and no longer offered them the protection he once had. When it became known that her father was dead and her family bankrupt, that would be the end of House Davar. They\u2019d be consumed and subjugated to another house.\r\nThey\u2019d be worked to the bone as punishment\u2014in fact, they might even face assassination by disgruntled creditors. Preventing that depended on Shallan, and the first step came with Jasnah Kholin.\r\nShallan took a deep breath, then strode around the corner."

      "ChapterName": "4: THE SHATTERED PLAINS",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\n\u201CI\u2019m dying, aren\u2019t I? Healer, why do you take my blood? Who is that beside you, with his head of lines? I can see a distant sun, dark and cold, shining in a black sky.\u201D\r\n\u2014Collected on the 3rd of Jesnan, 1172, 11 seconds pre-death. Subject was a Reshi chull trainer. Sample is of particular note.\r\n\u201CWhy don\u2019t you cry?\u201D the windspren asked.\r\nKaladin sat with his back to the corner of the cage, looking down. The floor planks in front of him were splintered, as if someone had dug at them with nothing but his fingernails. The splintered section was stained dark where the dry grey wood had soaked up blood. A futile, delusional attempt at escape.\r\nThe wagon continued to roll. The same routine each day. Wake up sore and aching from a fitful night spent without mattress or blanket. One wagon at a time, the slaves were let out and hobbled with leg irons and given time to shuffle around and relieve themselves. Then they were packed away and given morning slop, and the wagons rolled until afternoon slop. More rolling. Evening slop, then a ladle of water before sleep.\r\nKaladin\u2019s\r\nshashbrand was still cracked and bleeding. At least the cage\u2019s top gave shade from the sun.\r\nThe windspren shifted to mist, floating like a tiny cloud. She moved in close to Kaladin, the motion outlining her face at the front of the cloud, as if blowing back the fog and revealing something more substantial underneath. Vaporous, feminine, and angular. With such curious eyes. Like no other spren he\u2019d seen.\r\n\u201CThe others cry at night,\u201D she said. \u201CBut you don\u2019t.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhy cry?\u201D he said, leaning his head back against the bars. \u201CWhat would it change?\u201D\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know. Why\r\ndomen cry?\u201D\r\nHe smiled, closing his eyes. \u201CAsk the Almighty why men cry, little spren. Not me.\u201D His forehead dripped with sweat from the Eastern summer humidity, and it stung as it seeped into his wound. Hopefully, they\u2019d have some weeks of spring again soon. Weather and seasons were unpredictable. You never knew how long they would go on, though typically each would last a few weeks.\r\nThe wagon rolled on. After a time, he felt sunlight on his face. He opened his eyes. The sun shone in through the upper side of the cage. Two or three hours past noon, then. What of afternoon slop? Kaladin stood, pulling himself up with one hand on the steel bars. He couldn\u2019t make out Tvlakv driving the wagon up ahead, only flat-faced Bluth behind. The mercenary had on a dirty shirt that laced up the front and wore a wide-brimmed hat against the sun, his spear and cudgel riding on the wagon bench beside him. He didn\u2019t carry a sword\u2014not even Tvlakv did that, not near Alethi land.\r\nThe grass continued to part for the wagons, vanishing just in front, then creeping out after the wagons passed. The landscape here was dotted with strange shrubs that Kaladin didn\u2019t recognize. They had thick stalks and stems and spiny green needles. Whenever the wagons grew too close, the needles pulled into the stalks, leaving behind twisted, wormlike trunks with knotted branches. They dotted the hilly landscape, rising from the grass-covered rocks like diminutive sentries.\r\nThe wagons just kept on going, well past noon.\r\nWhy aren\u2019t we stopping for slop?\r\nThe lead wagon finally pulled to a stop. The other two lurched to a halt behind it, the red-carapaced chulls fidgeted, their antennae waving back and forth. The box-shaped animals had bulging, stony shells and thick, trunklike red legs. From what Kaladin had heard, their claws could snap a man\u2019s arm. But chulls were docile, particularly domesticated ones, and he\u2019d never known anyone in the army to get more than a halfhearted pinch from one.\r\nBluth and Tag climbed down from their wagons and walked up to meet Tvlakv. The slavemaster stood on his wagon\u2019s seat, shading his eyes against the white sunlight and holding a sheet of paper in his hand. An argument ensued. Tvlakv kept waving in the direction they had been going, then pointing at his sheet of paper.\r\n\u201CLost, Tvlakv?\u201D Kaladin called. \u201CPerhaps you should pray to the Almighty for guidance. I hear he has a fondness for slavers. Keeps a special room in Damnation just for you.\u201D\r\nTo Kaladin\u2019s left, one of the slaves\u2014the long-bearded man who had talked to him a few days back\u2014sidled away, not wanting to stand close to a person who was provoking the slaver.\r\nTvlakv hesitated, then waved curtly to his mercenaries, silencing them. The portly man hopped down from his wagon and walked over to Kaladin. \u201CYou,\u201D he said. \u201CDeserter. Alethi armies travel these lands for their war. Do you know anything of the area?\u201D\r\n\u201CLet me see the map,\u201D Kaladin said. Tvlakv hesitated, then held it up for Kaladin.\r\nKaladin reached through the bars and snatched the paper. Then, without reading it, Kaladin ripped it in two. In seconds he\u2019d shredded it into a hundred pieces in front of Tvlakv\u2019s horrified eyes.\r\nTvlakv called for the mercenaries, but by the time they arrived, Kaladin had a double handful of confetti to toss out at them. \u201CHappy Middlefest, you bastards,\u201D Kaladin said as the flakes of paper fluttered around them. He turned and walked to the other side of the cage and sat down, facing them.\r\nTvlakv stood, speechless. Then, red faced, he pointed at Kaladin and hissed something at the mercenaries. Bluth took a step toward the cage, but then thought better of it. He glanced at Tvlakv, then shrugged and walked away. Tvlakv turned to Tag, but the other mercenary just shook his head, saying something soft.\r\nAfter a few minutes of stewing at the cowardly mercenaries, Tvlakv rounded the cage and approached where Kaladin was sitting. Surprisingly, when he spoke, his voice was calm. \u201CI see you are clever, deserter. You have made yourself invaluable. My other slaves, they aren\u2019t from this area, and I have never come this way. You can bargain. What is it you wish in exchange for leading us? I can promise you an extra meal each day, should you please me.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou want me to lead the caravan?\u201D\r\n\u201CInstructions will be acceptable.\u201D\r\n\u201CAll right. First, find a cliff.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat, it will give you a vantage to see the area?\u201D\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CIt will give me something to throw you off of.\u201D\r\nTvlakv adjusted his cap in annoyance, brushing back one of his long white eyebrows. \u201CYou hate me. That is good. Hatred will keep you strong, make you sell for much. But you will not find vengeance on me unless I have a chance to take you to market. I will not let you escape. But perhaps someone else would. You want to be sold, you see?\u201D\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t want vengeance,\u201D Kaladin said. The windspren came back\u2014she\u2019d darted off for a time to inspect one of the strange shrubs. She landed in the air and began walking around Tvlakv\u2019s face, inspecting him. He didn\u2019t seem to be able to see her.\r\nTvlakv frowned. \u201CNo vengeance?\u201D\r\n\u201CIt doesn\u2019t work,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CI learned that lesson long ago.\u201D\r\n\u201CLong ago? You cannot be older than eighteen years, deserter.\u201D\r\nIt was a good guess. He was nineteen. Had it really only been four years since he\u2019d joined Amaram\u2019s army? Kaladin felt as if he\u2019d aged a dozen.\r\n\u201CYou are young,\u201D Tvlakv continued. \u201CYou could escape this fate of yours. Men have been known to live beyond the slave\u2019s brand\u2014you could pay off your slave price, you see? Or convince one of your masters to give you your freedom. You could become a free man again. It is not so unlikely.\u201D\r\nKaladin snorted. \u201CI\u2019ll never be free of these brands, Tvlakv. You must know that I\u2019ve tried\u2014and failed\u2014to escape ten times over. It\u2019s more than these glyphs on my head that makes your mercenaries wary.\u201D\r\n\u201CPast failure does not prove that there is not chance in the future, yes?\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m finished. I don\u2019t care.\u201D He eyed the slaver. \u201CBesides, you don\u2019t actually believe what you\u2019re saying. I doubt a man like you would be able to sleep at night if he thought the slaves he sold would be free to seek him out one day.\u201D\r\nTvlakv laughed. \u201CPerhaps, deserter. Perhaps you are right. Or perhaps I simply think that if you\r\nwereto get free, you would hunt down the first man who sold you to slavery, you see? Highlord Amaram, was it not? His death would give me warning so I can run.\u201D\r\nHow had he known? How had he heard about Amaram?\r\nI\u2019ll find him,Kaladin thought.\r\nI\u2019ll gut him with my own hands. I\u2019ll twist his head right off his neck, I\u2019ll\u2014\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D Tvlakv said, studying Kaladin\u2019s face, \u201Cso you were not so honest when you said you do not thirst for vengeance. I see.\u201D\r\n\u201CHow do you know about Amaram?\u201D Kaladin said, scowling. \u201CI\u2019ve changed hands a half-dozen times since then.\u201D\r\n\u201CMen talk. Slavers more than most. We must be friends with one another, you see, for nobody else will stomach us.\u201D\r\n\u201CThen you know that I didn\u2019t get this brand for deserting.\u201D\r\n\u201CAh, but it is what we must pretend, you see? Men guilty of high crimes, they do not sell so well. With that\r\nshashglyph on your head, it will be difficult enough to get a good price for you. If I cannot sell you, then you\u2026well, you will not wish for that status. So we will play a game together. I will say you are a deserter. And you will say nothing. It is an easy game, I think.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s illegal.\u201D\r\n\u201CWe are not in Alethkar,\u201D Tvlakv said, \u201Cso there is no law. Besides, desertion was the official reason for your sale. Claim otherwise, and you will gain nothing but a reputation for dishonesty.\u201D\r\n\u201CNothing besides a headache for you.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut you just said you have no desire for vengeance against me.\u201D\r\n\u201CI could learn.\u201D\r\nTvlakv laughed. \u201CAh, if you have not learned that already, then you probably never will! Besides, did you not threaten to throw me off a cliff? I think you have learned already. But now, we\r\nmustdiscuss how to proceed. My map has met with an untimely demise, you see.\u201D\r\nKaladin hesitated, then sighed. \u201CI don\u2019t know,\u201D he said honestly. \u201CI\u2019ve never been this way either.\u201D\r\nTvlakv frowned. He leaned closer to the cage, inspecting Kaladin, though he still kept his distance. After a moment, Tvlakv shook his head. \u201CI believe you, deserter. A pity. Well, I shall trust my memory. The map was poorly rendered anyway. I am almost glad you ripped it, for I was tempted to do the same myself. If I should happen across any portraits of my former wives, I shall see that they cross your path and take advantage of your unique talents.\u201D He strolled away.\r\nKaladin watched him go, then cursed to himself.\r\n\u201CWhat was that for?\u201D the windspren said, walking up to him, head cocked.\r\n\u201CI almost find myself liking him,\u201D Kaladin said, pounding his head back against the cage.\r\n\u201CBut\u2026after what he did\u2026\u201D\r\nKaladin shrugged. \u201CI didn\u2019t say Tvlakv isn\u2019t a bastard. He\u2019s just a likable bastard.\u201D He hesitated, then grimaced. \u201CThose are the worst kind. When you kill them, you end up feeling guilty for it.\u201D\r\nThe wagon leaked during highstorms. That wasn\u2019t surprising; Kaladin suspected that Tvlakv had been driven to slaving by ill fortune. He would rather be trading other goods, but something\u2014lack of funds, a need to leave his previous environs with haste\u2014had forced him to pick up this least reputable of careers.\r\nMen like him couldn\u2019t afford luxury, or even quality. They could barely stay ahead of their debts. In this case, that meant wagons which leaked. The boarded sides were strong enough to withstand highstorm winds, but they weren\u2019t comfortable.\r\nTvlakv had almost missed getting ready for this highstorm. Apparently, the map Kaladin had torn up had also included a list of highstorm dates purchased from a roving stormwarden. The storms could be predicted mathematically; Kaladin\u2019s father had made a hobby of it. He\u2019d been able to pick the right day eight times out of ten.\r\nThe boards rattled against the cage\u2019s bars as wind buffeted the vehicle, shaking it, making it lurch it like a clumsy giant\u2019s plaything. The wood groaned and spurts of icy rainwater sprayed through cracks. Flashes of lightning leaked through as well, accompanied by thunder. That was the only light they got.\r\nOccasionally, light would flash without the thunder. The slaves would groan in terror at this, thinking about the Stormfather, the shades of the Lost Radiants, or the Voidbringers\u2014all of which were said to haunt the most violent highstorms. They huddled together on the far side of the wagon, sharing warmth. Kaladin left them to it, sitting alone with his back to the bars.\r\nKaladin didn\u2019t fear stories of things that walked the storms. In the army, he\u2019d been forced to weather a highstorm or two beneath the lip of a protective stone overhang or other bit of impromptu shelter. Nobody liked to be out during a storm, but sometimes you couldn\u2019t avoid it. The things that walked the storms\u2014perhaps even the Stormfather himself\u2014weren\u2019t nearly so deadly as the rocks and branches cast up into the air. In fact, the storm\u2019s initial tempest of water and wind\u2014the stormwall\u2014was the most dangerous part. The longer one endured after that, the weaker the storm grew, until the trailing edge was nothing more than sprinkling rain.\r\nNo, he wasn\u2019t worried about Voidbringers looking for flesh to feast upon. He was worried that something would happen to Tvlakv. The slavemaster waited out the storm in a cramped wooden enclosure built into the bottom of his wagon. That was ostensibly the safest place in the caravan, but an unlucky twist of fate\u2014a tempest-thrown boulder, the collapse of the wagon\u2014could leave him dead. In that case, Kaladin could see Bluth and Tag running off, leaving everyone in their cages, wooden sides locked up. The slaves would die a slow death by starvation and dehydration, baking under the sun in these boxes.\r\nThe storm continued to blow, shaking the wagon. Those winds felt like live things at times. And who was to say they weren\u2019t? Were windspren attracted\r\ntogusts of wind, or\r\nwerethey the gusts of wind? The souls of the force that now wanted so badly to destroy Kaladin\u2019s wagon?\r\nThat force\u2014sentient or not\u2014failed. The wagons were chained to nearby boulders with their wheels locked. The blasts of wind grew more lethargic. Lightning stopped flashing, and the maddening drumming of rain became a quiet tapping instead. Only once during their journey had a wagon toppled during a highstorm. Both it and the slaves inside had survived with a few dents and bruises.\r\nThe wooden side to Kaladin\u2019s right shook suddenly, then fell open as Bluth undid its clasps. The mercenary wore his leather coat against the wet, streams of water falling from the brim of his hat as he exposed the bars\u2014and the occupants\u2014to the rain. It was cold, though not as piercingly so as during the height of the storm. It sprayed across Kaladin and the huddled slaves. Tvlakv always ordered the wagons uncovered before the rain stopped; he said it was the only way to wash away the slaves\u2019 stink.\r\nBluth slid the wooden side into place beneath the wagon, then opened the other two sides. Only the wall at the front of the wagon\u2014just behind the driver\u2019s seat\u2014couldn\u2019t be brought down.\r\n\u201CLittle early to be taking down the sides, Bluth,\u201D Kaladin said. It wasn\u2019t quite the riddens yet\u2014the period near the end of a highstorm when the rain sprinkled softly. This rain was still heavy, the wind still gusting on occasion.\r\n\u201CThe master wants you plenty clean today.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhy?\u201D Kaladin asked, rising, water streaming from his ragged brown clothing.\r\nBluth ignored him.\r\nPerhaps we\u2019re nearing our destination, Kaladin thought as he scanned the landscape.\r\nOver the last few days, the hills had given way to uneven rock formations\u2014places where weathering winds had left behind crumbling cliffs and jagged shapes. Grass grew up the rocky sides that saw the most sun, and other plants were plentiful in the shade. The time right after a highstorm was when the land was most alive. Rockbud polyps split and sent out their vines. Other kinds of vine crept from crevices, licking up water. Leaves unfolded from shrubs and trees. Cremlings of all kinds slithered through puddles, enjoying the banquet. Insects buzzed into the air; larger crustaceans\u2014crabs and leggers\u2014left their hiding places. The very rocks seemed to come to life.\r\nKaladin noted a half-dozen windspren flitting overhead, their translucent forms chasing after\u2014or perhaps cruising along with\u2014the highstorm\u2019s last gusts. Tiny lights rose around the plants. Lifespren. They looked like motes of glowing green dust or swarms of tiny translucent insects.\r\nA legger\u2014its hairlike spines lifted to the air to give warning of changes in the wind\u2014climbed along the side of the cart, its long body lined with dozens of pairs of legs. That was familiar enough, but he\u2019d never seen a legger with such a deep purple carapace. Where was Tvlakv taking the caravan? Those uncultivated hillsides were perfect for farming. You could spread stumpweight sap on them\u2014mixed with lavis seeds\u2014during seasons of weaker storms following the Weeping. In four months, you\u2019d have polyps larger than a man\u2019s head growing all along the hill, ready to break open for the grain inside.\r\nThe chulls lumbered about, feasting on rockbuds, slugs, and smaller crustaceans that had appeared after the storm. Tag and Bluth quietly hitched the beasts to their harnesses as a grumpy-looking Tvlakv crawled out of his waterproof refuge. The slavemaster pulled on a cap and deep black cloak against the rain. He rarely came out until the storm had passed completely; he was\r\nveryeager to get to their destination. Were they that close to the coast? That was one of the only places where they\u2019d find cities in the Unclaimed Hills.\r\nWithin minutes, the wagons were rolling again across the uneven ground. Kaladin settled back as the sky cleared, the highstorm a smudge of blackness on the western horizon. The sun brought welcome warmth, and the slaves basked in the light, streams of water dripping from their clothing and running out the back of the rocking wagon.\r\nPresently, a translucent ribbon of light zipped up to Kaladin. He was coming to take the windspren\u2019s presence for granted. She had gone out during the storm, but she\u2019d come back. As always.\r\n\u201CI saw others of your kind,\u201D Kaladin said idly.\r\n\u201COthers?\u201D she asked, taking the form of a young woman. She began to step around him in the air, spinning occasionally, dancing to some unheard beat.\r\n\u201CWindspren,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CChasing after the storm. Are you certain you don\u2019t want to go with them?\u201D\r\nShe glanced westward, longingly. \u201CNo,\u201D she finally said, continuing her dance. \u201CI like it here.\u201D\r\nKaladin shrugged. She\u2019d ceased playing as many pranks as she once had, and so he\u2019d stopped letting her presence annoy him.\r\n\u201CThere are others near,\u201D she said. \u201COthers like you.\u201D\r\n\u201CSlaves?\u201D\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know. People. Not the ones here. Other ones.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhere?\u201D\r\nShe turned a translucent white finger, pointing eastward. \u201CThere. Many of them. Lots and lots.\u201D\r\nKaladin stood up. He couldn\u2019t imagine that a spren had a good handle on how to measure distance and numbers.\r\nYes\u2026Kaladin squinted, studying the horizon.\r\nThat\u2019s smoke. From chimneys?He caught a gust of it on the wind; if not for the rain, he\u2019d probably have smelled it sooner.\r\nShould he care? It didn\u2019t matter where he was a slave; he\u2019d still be a slave. He\u2019d accepted this life. That was his way now. Don\u2019t care, don\u2019t bother.\r\nStill, he watched with curiosity as his wagon climbed the side of a hill and gave the slaves inside a good vantage of what was ahead. It wasn\u2019t a city. It was something grander, something larger. An enormous army encampment.\r\n\u201CGreat Father of Storms\u2026\u201D Kaladin whispered.\r\nTen masses of troops bivouacked in familiar Alethi patterns\u2014circular, by company rank, with camp followers on the outskirts, mercenaries in a ring just inside them, citizen soldiers near the middle, lighteyed officers at the very center. They were camped in a series of enormous craterlike rock formations, only the sides were more irregular, more jagged. Like broken eggshells.\r\nKaladin had left an army much like this eight months ago, though Amaram\u2019s force had been much smaller. This one covered miles of stone, stretching far both north and south. A thousand banners bearing a thousand different family glyphpairs flapped proudly in the air. There were some tents\u2014mainly on the outside of the armies\u2014but most of the troops were housed in large stone barracks. That meant Soulcasters.\r\nThat encampment directly ahead of them flew a banner Kaladin had seen in books. Deep blue with white glyphs\u2014\r\nkhokhand\r\nlinil, stylized and painted as a sword standing before a crown. House Kholin. The king\u2019s house.\r\nDaunted, Kaladin looked beyond the armies. The landscape to the east was as he\u2019d heard it described in a dozen different stories detailing the king\u2019s campaign against the Parshendi betrayers. It was an enormous riven plain of rock\u2014so wide he couldn\u2019t see the other side\u2014that was split and cut by sheer chasms, crevasses twenty or thirty feet wide. They were so deep that they disappeared into darkness and formed a jagged mosaic of uneven plateaus. Some large, others tiny. The expansive plain looked like a platter that had been broken, its pieces then reassembled with small gaps between the fragments.\r\n\u201CThe Shattered Plains,\u201D Kaladin whispered.\r\n\u201CWhat?\u201D the windspren asked. \u201CWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201D\r\nKaladin shook his head, bemused. \u201CI spent years trying to get to this place. It\u2019s what Tien wanted, in the end at least. To come here, fight in the king\u2019s army\u2026\u201D\r\nAnd now Kaladin was here. Finally.\r\nAccidentally.He felt like laughing at the absurdity.\r\nI should have realized,he thought.\r\nI should have known. We weren\u2019t ever heading toward the coast and its cities. We were heading here. To war.\r\nThis place would be subject to Alethi law and rules. He\u2019d expected that Tvlakv would want to avoid such things. But here, he\u2019d probably also find the best prices.\r\n\u201CThe Shattered Plains?\u201D one of the slaves said. \u201CReally?\u201D\r\nOthers crowded around, peering out. In their sudden excitement, they seemed to forget their fear of Kaladin.\r\n\u201CIt\r\nisthe Shattered Plains!\u201D another man said. \u201CThat\u2019s the king\u2019s army!\u201D\r\n\u201CPerhaps we\u2019ll find justice here,\u201D another said.\r\n\u201CI hear the king\u2019s house hold servants live as well as the finest merchants,\u201D said another. \u201CHis slaves have to be better off too. We\u2019ll be in Vorin lands; we\u2019ll even make wages!\u201D\r\nThat much was true. When worked, slaves had to be paid a small wage\u2014half what a nonslave would be paid, which was already often less than a full citizen would make for the same work. But it was something, and Alethi law required it. Only ardents\u2014who couldn\u2019t own anything anyway\u2014didn\u2019t have to be paid. Well, them and parshmen. But parshmen were more animal than anything else.\r\nA slave could apply his earnings to his slave debt and, after years of labor, earn his freedom. Theoretically. The others continued to chatter as the wagons rolled down the incline, but Kaladin withdrew to the back of the wagon. He suspected that the option to pay off a slave\u2019s price was a sham, intended to keep slaves docile. The debt was enormous, far more than a slave sold for, and virtually impossible to earn out.\r\nUnder previous masters, he\u2019d demanded his wages be given to him. They had always found ways to cheat him\u2014charging him for his housing, his food. That\u2019s how lighteyes were. Roshone, Amaram, Katarotam\u2026Each lighteyes Kaladin had known, whether as a slave or a free man, had shown himself to be corrupt to the core, for all his outward poise and beauty. They were like rotting corpses clothed in beautiful silk.\r\nThe other slaves kept talking about the king\u2019s army, and about justice.\r\nJustice?Kaladin thought, resting back against the bars.\r\nI\u2019m not convinced thereis\r\nsuch a thing as justice.Still, he found himself wondering. That was the king\u2019s army\u2014the armies of all ten highprinces\u2014come to fulfill the Vengeance Pact.\r\nIf there was one thing he still let himself long for, it was the chance to hold a spear. To fight again, to try and find his way back to the man he had been. A man who had cared.\r\nIf he would find that anywhere, he\u2019d find it here."

      "ChapterName": "5: HERETIC",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\n\u201CI have seen the end, and have heard it named. The Night of Sorrows, the True Desolation. The Everstorm.\u201D\r\n\u2014Collected on the 1st of Nanes, 1172, 15 seconds pre-death. Subject was a darkeyed youth of unknown origin.\r\nShallan had not expected Jasnah Kholin to be so beautiful.\r\nIt was a stately, mature beauty\u2014as one might find in the portrait of some historical scholar. Shallan realized that she\u2019d naively been expecting Jasnah to be an ugly spinster, like the stern matrons who had tutored her years ago. How else could one picture a heretic well into her mid-thirties and still unmarried?\r\nJasnah was nothing like that. She was tall and slender, with clear skin, narrow black eyebrows, and thick, deep onyx hair. She wore part of it up, wrapped around a small, scroll-shaped golden ornament with two long hairpins holding it in place. The rest tumbled down behind her neck in small, tight curls. Even twisted and curled as it was, it came down to Jasnah\u2019s shoulders\u2014if left unbound, it would be as long as Shallan\u2019s hair, reaching past the middle of her back.\r\nShe had a squarish face and discriminating pale violet eyes. She was listening to a man dressed in robes of burnt orange and white, the Kharbranthian royal colors. Brightness Kholin was several fingers taller than the man\u2014apparently, the Alethi reputation for height was no exaggeration. Jasnah glanced at Shallan, noting her, then returned to her conversation.\r\nStormfather! This woman\r\nwasthe sister of a king. Reserved, statuesque, dressed immaculately in blue and silver. Like Shallan\u2019s dress, Jasnah\u2019s buttoned up the sides and had a high collar, though Jasnah had a much fuller chest than Shallan. The skirts were loose below the waist, falling generously to the floor. Her sleeves were long and stately, and the left one was buttoned up to hide her safehand.\r\nOn her freehand was a distinctive piece of jewelry: two rings and a bracelet connected by several chains, holding a triangular group of gemstones across the back of the hand. A Soulcaster\u2014the word was used for both the people who performed the process and the fabrial that made it possible.\r\nShallan edged into the room, trying to get a better look at the large, glowing gemstones. Her heart began to beat a little faster. The Soulcaster looked identical to the one she and her brothers had found in the inside pocket of her father\u2019s coat.\r\nJasnah and the man in robes began walking in Shallan\u2019s direction, still talking. How would Jasnah react, now that her ward had finally caught up to her? Would she be angry because of Shallan\u2019s tardiness? Shallan couldn\u2019t be blamed for that, but people often expect irrational things from their inferiors.\r\nLike the grand cavern outside, this hallway was cut from the rock, but it was more richly furbished, with ornate hanging chandeliers made with Stormlit gemstones. Most were deep violet garnets, which were among the less valuable stones. Even so, the sheer number hanging there glistening with violet light would make the chandelier worth a small fortune. More than that, however, Shallan was impressed with the symmetry of the design and the beauty of the pattern of crystals hanging at the sides of the chandelier.\r\nAs Jasnah grew near, Shallan could hear some of what she was saying.\r\n\u201C\u2026realize that this action might prompt an unfavorable reaction from the devotaries?\u201D the woman said, speaking in Alethi. It was very near to Shallan\u2019s native Veden, and she\u2019d been taught to speak it well during her childhood.\r\n\u201CYes, Brightness,\u201D said the robed man. He was elderly, with a wispy white beard, and had pale grey eyes. His open, kindly face seemed very concerned, and he wore a squat, cylindrical hat that matched the orange and white of his robes. Rich robes. Was this some kind of royal steward, perhaps?\r\nNo. Those gemstones on his fingers, the way he carried himself, the way other lighteyed attendants deferred to him\u2026\r\nStormfather!Shallan thought.\r\nThis has to be the king himself!Not Jasnah\u2019s brother, Elhokar, but the king of Kharbranth. Taravangian.\r\nShallan hastily performed an appropriate curtsy, which Jasnah noted.\r\n\u201CThe ardents have much sway here, Your Majesty,\u201D Jasnah said with a smooth voice.\r\n\u201CAs do I,\u201D the king said. \u201CYou needn\u2019t worry about me.\u201D\r\n\u201CVery well,\u201D Jasnah said. \u201CYour terms are agreeable. Lead me to the location, and I shall see what can be done. If you will excuse me as we walk, however, I have someone to attend to.\u201D Jasnah made a curt motion toward Shallan, waving her to join them.\r\n\u201COf course, Brightness,\u201D the king said. He seemed to defer to Jasnah. Kharbranth was a very small kingdom\u2014just a single city\u2014while Alethkar was one of the world\u2019s most powerful. An Alethi princess might well outrank a Kharbranthian king in real terms, however protocol would have it.\r\nShallan hurried to catch up to Jasnah, who walked a little behind the king as he began to speak to his attendants. \u201CBrightness,\u201D Shallan said. \u201CI am Shallan Davar, whom you asked to meet you. I deeply regret not being able to get to you in Dumadari.\u201D\r\n\u201CThe fault was not yours,\u201D Jasnah said with a wave of the fingers. \u201CI didn\u2019t expect that you would make it in time. I wasn\u2019t certain where I would be going after Dumadari when I sent you that note, however.\u201D\r\nJasnah wasn\u2019t angry; that was a good sign. Shallan felt some of her anxiety recede.\r\n\u201CI am impressed by your tenacity, child,\u201D Jasnah continued. \u201CI honestly didn\u2019t expect you to follow me this far. After Kharbranth, I was going to forgo leaving you notes, as I\u2019d presumed that you\u2019d have given up. Most do so after the first few stops.\u201D\r\nMost? Then it was a\r\ntestof some sort? And Shallan had passed?\r\n\u201CYes indeed,\u201D Jasnah continued, voice musing. \u201CPerhaps I will actually allow you to petition me for a place as my ward.\u201D\r\nShallan almost stumbled in shock.\r\nPetitionher? Wasn\u2019t that what she\u2019d already done? \u201CBrightness,\u201D Shallan said, \u201CI thought that\u2026Well, your letter\u2026\u201D\r\nJasnah eyed her. \u201CI gave you leave to\r\nmeetme, Miss Davar. I did not promise to take you on. The training and care of a ward is a distraction for which I have little tolerance or time at the present. But you have traveled far. I will entertain your request, though understand that my requirements are strict.\u201D\r\nShallan covered a grimace.\r\n\u201CNo tantrum,\u201D Jasnah noted. \u201CThat is a good sign.\u201D\r\n\u201CTantrum, Brightness? From a lighteyed woman?\u201D\r\n\u201CYou\u2019d be surprised,\u201D Jasnah said dryly. \u201CBut attitude alone will not earn your place. Tell me, how extensive is your education?\u201D\r\n\u201CExtensive in some areas,\u201D Shallan said. Then she hesitantly added, \u201CExtensively lacking in others.\u201D\r\n\u201CVery well,\u201D Jasnah said. Ahead, the king seemed to be in a hurry, but he was old enough that even an urgent walk was still slow. \u201CThen we shall do an evaluation. Answer truthfully and do not exaggerate, as I will soon discover your lies. Feign no false modesty, either. I haven\u2019t the patience for a simperer.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes, Brightness.\u201D\r\n\u201CWe shall begin with music. How would you judge your skill?\u201D\r\n\u201CI have a good ear, Brightness,\u201D Shallan said honestly. \u201CI\u2019m best with voice, though I have been trained on the zither and the pipes. I would be far from the best you\u2019d heard, but I\u2019d also be far from the worst. I know most historical ballads by heart.\u201D\r\n\u201CGive me the refrain from \u2018Lilting Adrene.\u2019\u201D\r\n\u201CHere?\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m not fond of repeating myself, child.\u201D\r\nShallan blushed, but began to sing. It wasn\u2019t her finest performance, but her tone was pure and she didn\u2019t stumble over any of the words.\r\n\u201CGood,\u201D Jasnah said as Shallan paused for a breath. \u201CLanguages?\u201D\r\nShallan fumbled for a moment, bringing her attention away from frantically trying to remember the next verse. Languages? \u201CI can speak your native Alethi, obviously,\u201D Shallan said. \u201CI have a passable reading knowledge of Thaylen and good spoken Azish. I can make myself understood in Selay, but not read it.\u201D\r\nJasnah made no comment either way. Shallan began to grow nervous.\r\n\u201CWriting?\u201D Jasnah asked.\r\n\u201CI know all of the major, minor, and topical glyphs and can paint them calligraphically.\u201D\r\n\u201CSo can most children.\u201D\r\n\u201CThe glyphwards that I paint are regarded by those who know me as quite impressive.\u201D\r\n\u201CGlyphwards?\u201D Jasnah said. \u201CI had reason to believe you wanted to be a scholar, not a purveyor of superstitious nonsense.\u201D\r\n\u201CI have kept a journal since I was a child,\u201D Shallan continued, \u201Cin order to practice my writing skills.\u201D\r\n\u201CCongratulations,\u201D Jasnah said. \u201CShould I need someone to write a treatise on their stuffed pony or give an account of an interesting pebble they discovered, I shall send for you. Is there nothing you can offer that shows you have true skill?\u201D\r\nShallan blushed. \u201CWith all due respect, Brightness, you have a letter from me yourself, and it was persuasive enough to make you grant me this audience.\u201D\r\n\u201CA valid point,\u201D Jasnah said, nodding. \u201CIt took you long enough to make it. How is your training in logic and its related arts?\u201D\r\n\u201CI am accomplished in basic mathematics,\u201D Shallan said, still flustered, \u201Cand I often helped with minor accounts for my father. I have read through the complete works of Tormas, Nashan, Niali the Just, and\u2014of course\u2014Nohadon.\u201D\r\n\u201CPlacini?\u201D\r\nWho? \u201CNo.\u201D\r\n\u201CGabrathin, Yustara, Manaline, Syasikk, Shauka-daughter-Hasweth?\u201D\r\nShallan cringed and shook her head again. That last name was obviously Shin. Did the Shin people even\r\nhavelogicmasters? Did Jasnah really expect her wards to have studied such obscure texts?\r\n\u201CI see,\u201D Jasnah said. \u201CWell, what of history?\u201D\r\nHistory. Shallan shrank down even further. \u201CI\u2026This is one of the areas where I\u2019m obviously deficient, Brightness. My father was never able to find a suitable tutor for me. I read the history books he owned\u2026.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhich were?\u201D\r\n\u201CThe entire set of Barlesha Lhan\u2019s\r\nTopics, mostly.\u201D\r\nJasnah waved her freehand dismissively. \u201CBarely worth the time spent scribing them. A popular survey of historical events at best.\u201D\r\n\u201CI apologize, Brightness.\u201D\r\n\u201CThis is an embarrassing hole. History is\r\nthemost important of the literary subarts. One would think that your parents would have taken specific care in this area, if they\u2019d hoped to submit you to study under a historian like myself.\u201D\r\n\u201CMy circumstances are unusual, Brightness.\u201D\r\n\u201CIgnorance is hardly unusual, Miss Davar. The longer I live, the more I come to realize that it is the natural state of the human mind. There are many who will strive to defend its sanctity and then expect you to be impressed with their efforts.\u201D\r\nShallan blushed again. She\u2019d realized she had some deficiencies, but Jasnah had unreasonable expectations. She said nothing, continuing to walk beside the taller woman. How long was this hallway, anyway? She was so flustered she didn\u2019t even look at the paintings they passed. They turned a corner, walking deeper into the mountainside.\r\n\u201CWell, let us move on to science, then,\u201D Jasnah said, tone displeased. \u201CWhat can you say of yourself there?\u201D\r\n\u201CI have the reasonable foundation in the sciences you might expect of a young woman my age,\u201D Shallan said, more stiffly than she would have liked.\r\n\u201CWhich means?\u201D\r\n\u201CI can speak with skill about geography, geology, physics, and chemistry. I\u2019ve made particular study of biology and botany, as I was able to pursue them with a reasonable level of independence on my father\u2019s estates. But if you expect me to be able to solve Fabrisan\u2019s Conundrum with a wave of my hand, I suspect you shall be disappointed.\u201D\r\n\u201CHave I not a right to make reasonable demands of my potential students, Miss Davar?\u201D\r\n\u201CReasonable? Your demands are about as\r\nreasonableas the ones made of the Ten Heralds on Proving Day! With all due respect, Brightness, you seem to want potential wards to be master scholars already. I may be able to find a pair of eighty-year-old ardents in the city who\r\nmightfit your requirements. They could interview for the position, though they may have trouble hearing well enough to answer your questions.\u201D\r\n\u201CI see,\u201D Jasnah replied. \u201CAnd do you speak with such pique to your parents as well?\u201D\r\nShallan winced. Her time spent with the sailors had loosened her tongue far too much. Had she traveled all this way only to offend Jasnah? She thought of her brothers, destitute, keeping up a tenuous fa\u00E7ade back home. Would she have to return to them in defeat, having squandered this opportunity? \u201CI did not speak to them this way, Brightness. Nor should I to you. I apologize.\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, at least you are humble enough to admit fault. Still, I am disappointed. How is it that your mother considered you ready for a wardship?\u201D\r\n\u201CMy mother passed away when I was just a child, Brightness.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd your father soon remarried. Malise Gevelmar, I believe.\u201D\r\nShallan started at her knowledge. House Davar was ancient, but only of middling power and importance. The fact that Jasnah knew the name of\u00A0Shallan\u2019s stepmother said a lot about her. \u201CMy stepmother passed away recently. She didn\u2019t send me to be your ward. I took this initiative upon myself.\u201D\r\n\u201CMy condolences,\u201D Jasnah said. \u201CPerhaps you should be with your father, seeing to his estates and comforting him, rather than wasting my time.\u201D\r\nThe men walking ahead turned down another side passage. Jasnah and Shallan followed, entering a smaller corridor with an ornate red and yellow rug, mirrors hanging on the walls.\r\nShallan turned to Jasnah. \u201CMy father has no need of me.\u201D Well, that was true. \u201CBut I have great need of you, as this interview itself has proven. If ignorance galls you so much, can you in good conscience pass up the opportunity to rid me of mine?\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve done so before, Miss Davar. You are the twelfth young woman to ask me for a wardship this year.\u201D\r\nTwelve?Shallan thought.\r\nIn one year?And she\u2019d assumed that women would stay away from Jasnah because of her antagonism toward the devotaries.\r\nThe group reached the end of the narrow hallway, turning a corner to find\u2014to Shallan\u2019s surprise\u2014a place where a large chunk of rock had fallen from the ceiling. A dozen or so attendants stood here, some looking anxious. What was going on?\r\nMuch of the rubble had evidently been cleared away, though the gouge in the ceiling gaped ominously. It didn\u2019t look out on the sky; they had been progressing downward, and were probably far underground. A massive stone, taller than a man, had fallen into a doorway on the left. There was no getting past it into the room beyond. Shallan thought she heard sounds on the other side. The king stepped up to the stone, speaking in a comforting voice. He pulled a handkerchief out of his pocket and wiped his aged brow.\r\n\u201CThe dangers of living in a building cut directly into the rock,\u201D Jasnah said, striding forward. \u201CWhen did this happen?\u201D Apparently she hadn\u2019t been summoned to the city specifically for this purpose; the king was simply taking advantage of her presence.\r\n\u201CDuring the recent highstorm, Brightness,\u201D the king said. He shook his head, making his drooping, thin white mustache tremble. \u201CThe palace architects might be able to cut a way into the room, but it would take time, and the next highstorm is scheduled to hit in just a few days. Beyond that, breaking in might bring down more of the ceiling.\u201D\r\n\u201CI thought Kharbranth was protected from the highstorms, Your Majesty,\u201D Shallan said, causing Jasnah to shoot her a glance.\r\n\u201CThe city is sheltered, young woman,\u201D the king said. \u201CBut the stone mountain behind us is buffeted quite strongly. Sometimes it causes avalanches on that side, and that can cause the entire mountainside to shake.\u201D He glanced at the ceiling. \u201CCave-ins are very rare, and we thought this area was quite safe, but\u2026\u201D\r\n\u201CBut it is rock,\u201D Jasnah said, \u201Cand there is no telling if a weak vein lurks just beyond the surface.\u201D She inspected the monolith that had fallen from the ceiling. \u201CThis will be difficult. I will probably lose a very valuable focal stone.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2014\u201D the king began, wiping his brow again. \u201CIf only we had a Shardblade\u2014\u201D\r\nJasnah cut him off with a wave of the hand. \u201CI was not seeking to renegotiate our bargain, Your Majesty. Access to the Palanaeum is worth the cost. You will want to send someone for wet rags. Have the majority of the servants move down to the other end of the hallway. You may wish to wait there yourself.\u201D\r\n\u201CI will stay here,\u201D the king said, causing his attendants to object, including a large man wearing a black leather cuirass, probably his bodyguard. The king silenced them by raising his wrinkled hand. \u201CI will not hide like a coward when my granddaughter is trapped.\u201D\r\nNo wonder he was so anxious. Jasnah didn\u2019t argue further, and Shallan could see from her eyes that it was of no consequence to her if the king risked his life. The same apparently went for Shallan, for Jasnah didn\u2019t order her away. Servants approached with wetted cloths and distributed them. Jasnah refused hers. The king and his bodyguard raised theirs to their faces, covering mouth and nose.\r\nShallan took hers. What was the point of it? A couple of servants passed some wet cloths through a space between the rock and the wall to those inside. Then all of the servants rushed away down the hallway.\r\nJasnah picked and prodded at the boulder. \u201CMiss Davar,\u201D she said, \u201Cwhat method would you use to ascertain the mass of this stone?\u201D\r\nShallan blinked. \u201CWell, I suppose I\u2019d ask His Majesty. His architects probably calculated it.\u201D\r\nJasnah cocked her head. \u201CAn elegant response. Did they do that, Your Majesty?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes, Brightness Kholin,\u201D the king said. \u201CIt\u2019s roughly fifteen thousand kavals.\u201D\r\nJasnah eyed Shallan. \u201CA point in your favor, Miss Davar. A scholar knows not to waste time rediscovering information already known. It\u2019s a lesson I sometimes forget.\u201D\r\nShallan felt herself swell at the words. She already had an inkling that Jasnah did not give such praise lightly. Did this mean that the woman was still considering her as a ward?\r\nJasnah held up her freehand, Soulcaster glistening against the skin. Shallan felt her heartbeat speed up. She\u2019d never seen Soulcasting done in person. The ardents were very secretive in using their fabrials, and she hadn\u2019t even known that her father had one until they\u2019d found it on him. Of course, his no longer worked. That was one of the main reasons she was here.\r\nThe gemstones set into Jasnah\u2019s Soulcaster were enormous, some of the largest that Shallan had ever seen, worth many spheres each. One was smokestone, a pure glassy black gemstone. The second was a diamond. The third was a ruby. All three were cut\u2014a cut stone could hold more Stormlight\u2014into glistening, many-faceted oval shapes.\r\nJasnah closed her eyes, pressing her hand against the fallen boulder. She raised her head, inhaling slowly. The stones on the back of her hand began to glow more fiercely, the smokestone in particular growing so bright it was difficult to look at.\r\nShallan held her breath. The only thing she dared do was blink, committing the scene to memory. For a long, extended moment, nothing happened.\r\nAnd then, briefly, Shallan heard a sound. A low thrumming, like a distant group of voices, humming together a single, pure note.\r\nJasnah\u2019s hand\r\nsankinto the rock.\r\nThe stone vanished.\r\nA burst of dense black smoke exploded into the hallway. Enough to blind Shallan; it seemed the output of a thousand fires, and smelled of burned wood. Shallan hastily raised the wet rag to her face, dropping to her knees. Oddly, her ears felt stopped up, as if she\u2019d climbed down from a great height. She had to swallow to pop them.\r\nShe shut her eyes tightly as they began to water, and she held her breath. Her ears filled with a rushing sound.\r\nIt passed. She blinked open her eyes to find the king and his bodyguard huddled against the wall beside to her. Smoke still pooled at the ceiling; the hallway smelled strongly of it. Jasnah stood, eyes still closed, oblivious of the smoke\u2014though grime now dusted her face and clothing. It had left marks on the walls too.\r\nShallan had read of this, but she was still in awe. Jasnah had transformed the boulder into smoke, and since smoke was far less dense than stone, the change had pushed the smoke away in an explosive outburst.\r\nIt was true; Jasnah really\r\ndidhave a functioning Soulcaster. And a powerful one too. Nine out of ten Soulcasters were capable of a few limited transformations: creating water or grain from stone; forming bland, single-roomed rock buildings out of air or cloth. A greater one, like Jasnah\u2019s, could effectuate any transformation. Literally turn any substance into any other one. How it must grate on the ardents that such a powerful, holy relic was in the hands of someone outside the ardentia. And a heretic no less!\r\nShallan stumbled to her feet, leaving the cloth at her mouth, breathing humid but dust-free air. She swallowed, her ears popping again as the hall\u2019s pressure returned to normal. A moment later, the king rushed into the now-accessible room. A small girl\u2014along with several nursemaids and other palace servants\u2014sat on the other side, coughing. The king pulled the girl into his arms. She was too young to have a modesty sleeve.\r\nJasnah opened her eyes, blinking, as if momentarily confused by her location. She took a deep breath, and didn\u2019t cough. Indeed, she actually\r\nsmiled, as if enjoying the scent of the smoke.\r\nJasnah turned to Shallan, focusing on her. \u201CYou are still waiting for a response. I\u2019m afraid you will not like what I say.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut you haven\u2019t finished your testing of me yet,\u201D Shallan said, forcing herself to be bold. \u201CSurely you won\u2019t give judgment until you have.\u201D\r\n\u201CI haven\u2019t finished?\u201D Jasnah asked, frowning.\r\n\u201CYou didn\u2019t ask me about all of the feminine arts. You left out painting and drawing.\u201D\r\n\u201CI have never had much use for them.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut\r\ntheyare of the arts,\u201D Shallan said, feeling desperate. This was where she was most accomplished! \u201CMany consider the visual arts the most refined of them all. I brought my portfolio. I would show you what I can do.\u201D\r\nJasnah pursed her lips. \u201CThe visual arts are frivolity. I have weighed the facts, child, and I cannot accept you. I\u2019m sorry.\u201D\r\nShallan\u2019s heart sank.\r\n\u201CYour Majesty,\u201D Jasnah said to the king, \u201CI would like to go to the Palanaeum.\u201D\r\n\u201CNow?\u201D the king said, cradling his granddaughter. \u201CBut we are going to have a feast\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CI appreciate the offer,\u201D Jasnah said, \u201Cbut I find myself with an abundance of everything\r\nbuttime.\u201D\r\n\u201COf course,\u201D the king said. \u201CI will take you personally. Thank you for what you\u2019ve done. When I heard that you had requested entrance\u2026\u201D He continued to babble at Jasnah, who followed him wordlessly down the hallway, leaving Shallan behind.\r\nShe clutched her satchel to her chest, lowering the cloth from her mouth. Six months of chasing, for this. She gripped the rag in frustration, squeezing sooty water between her fingers. She wanted to cry. That was what she probably would have done if she\u2019d been that same child she had been six months ago.\r\nBut things had changed.\r\nShehad changed. If she failed, House Davar would fall. Shallan felt her determination redouble, though she wasn\u2019t able to stop a few tears of frustration from squeezing out of the corners of her eyes. She was not going to give up until Jasnah was forced to truss her up in chains and have the authorities drag her away.\r\nHer step surprisingly firm, she walked in the direction Jasnah had gone. Six months ago, she had explained a desperate plan to her brothers. She would apprentice herself to Jasnah Kholin, scholar, heretic. Not for the education. Not for the prestige. But in order to learn where she kept her Soulcaster.\r\nAnd then Shallan would steal it.\r\nCharcoal rubbing of a map of Sadeas\u2019s warcamp as used by a commom spearman.

      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\n\u201CI\u2019m cold. Mother, I\u2019m cold. Mother? Why can I still hear the rain? Will it stop?\u201D\r\n\u2014Collected on Vevishes, 1172, 32 seconds pre-death. Subject was a lighteyed female child, approximately six years old.\r\nTvlakv released all of the slaves from their cages at once. This time, he didn\u2019t fear runaways or a slave rebellion\u2014not with nothing but wilderness behind them and over a hundred thousand armed soldiers just ahead.\r\nKaladin stepped down from the wagon. They were inside one of the craterlike formations, its jagged stone wall rising just to the east. The ground had been cleared of plant life, and the rock was slick beneath his unshod feet. Pools of rainwater had gathered in depressions. The air was crisp and clean, and the sun strong overhead, though with this Eastern humidity, he always felt damp.\r\nAround them spread the signs of an army long settled; this war had been going on since the old king\u2019s death, nearly six years ago. Everyone told stories of that night, the night when Parshendi tribesmen had murdered King Gavilar.\r\nSquads of soldiers marched by, following directions indicated by painted circles at each intersection. The camp was packed with long stone bunkers, and there were more tents than Kaladin had discerned from above. Soulcasters couldn\u2019t be used to create every shelter. After the stink of the slave caravan, the place smelled good, brimming with familiar scents like treated leather and oiled weapons. However, many of the soldiers had a disorderly look. They weren\u2019t dirty, but they didn\u2019t seem particularly disciplined either. They roamed the camp in packs with coats undone. Some pointed and jeered at the slaves. This was the army of a highprince? The elite force that fought for Alethkar\u2019s honor? This was what Kaladin had aspired to join?\r\nBluth and Tag watched carefully as Kaladin lined up with the other slaves, but he didn\u2019t try anything. Now was not the time to provoke them\u2014Kaladin had seen how mercenaries acted when around commissioned troops. Bluth and Tag played their part, walking with their chests out and hands on their weapons. They shoved a few of the slaves into place, ramming a cudgel into one man\u2019s belly and cursing him gruffly.\r\nThey stayed clear of Kaladin.\r\n\u201CThe king\u2019s army,\u201D said the slave next to him. It was the dark-skinned man who had talked to Kaladin about escaping. \u201CI thought we were meant for mine work. Why, this won\u2019t be so bad at all. We\u2019ll be cleaning latrines or maintaining roads.\u201D\r\nOdd, to look forward to latrine work or labor in the hot sun. Kaladin hoped for something else. Hoped. Yes, he\u2019d discovered that he could still hope. A spear in his hands. An enemy to face. He could live like that.\r\nTvlakv spoke with an important-looking lighteyed woman. She wore her dark hair up in a complex weave, sparkling with infused amethysts, and her dress was a deep crimson. She looked much as Laral had, at the end. She was probably of the fourth or fifth dahn, wife and scribe to one of the camp\u2019s officers.\r\nTvlakv began to brag about his wares, but the woman raised a delicate hand. \u201CI can see what I am purchasing, slaver,\u201D she said in a smooth, aristocratic accent. \u201CI will inspect them myself.\u201D\r\nShe began to walk down the line, accompanied by several soldiers. Her dress was cut in the Alethi noble fashion\u2014a solid swath of silk, tight and formfitting through the top with sleek skirts below. It buttoned up the sides of the torso from waist to neck, where it was topped by a small, gold-embroidered collar. The longer left cuff hid her safehand. Kaladin\u2019s mother had always just worn a glove, which seemed far more practical to\u00A0him.\r\nJudging by her face, she was not particularly impressed with what she saw. \u201CThese men are half-starved and sickly,\u201D she said, taking a thin rod from a young female attendant. She used it to lift the hair from one man\u2019s forehead, inspecting his brand. \u201CYou are asking two emerald broams a head?\u201D\r\nTvlakv began to sweat. \u201CPerhaps one and a half?\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd what would I use them for? I wouldn\u2019t trust men this filthy near food, and we have parshmen to do most other work.\u201D\r\n\u201CIf Your Ladyship is not pleased, I could approach other highprinces\u2026.\u201D\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D she said, smacking the slave she\u2019d been regarding as he shied away from her. \u201COne and a quarter. They can help cut timber for us in the northern forests\u2026.\u201D She trailed off as she noticed Kaladin. \u201CHere now. This is far better stock than the others.\u201D\r\n\u201CI thought that you might like this one,\u201D Tvlakv said, stepping up to her. \u201CHe\r\nisquite\u2014\u201D\r\nShe raised the rod and silenced Tvlakv. She had a small sore on one lip. Some ground cussweed root could help with that.\r\n\u201CRemove your top, slave,\u201D she commanded.\r\nKaladin stared her right in her blue eyes and felt an almost irresistible urge to spit at her. No. No, he couldn\u2019t afford that. Not when there was a chance. He pulled his arms out of the sacklike clothing, letting it fall to his waist, exposing his chest.\r\nDespite eight months as a slave, he was far better muscled than the others. \u201CA large number of scars for one so young,\u201D the noblewoman said thoughtfully. \u201CYou are a military man?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes.\u201D His windspren zipped up to the woman, inspecting her face.\r\n\u201CMercenary?\u201D\r\n\u201CAmaram\u2019s army,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CA citizen, second nahn.\u201D\r\n\u201C\r\nOncea citizen,\u201D Tvlakv put in quickly. \u201CHe was\u2014\u201D\r\nShe silenced Tvlakv again with her rod, glaring at him. Then she used the rod to push aside Kaladin\u2019s hair and inspect his forehead.\r\n\u201C\r\nShashglyph,\u201D she said, clicking her tongue. Several of the soldiers nearby stepped closer, hands on their swords. \u201CWhere I come from, slaves who deserve these are simply executed.\u201D\r\n\u201CThey are fortunate,\u201D Kaladin said.\r\n\u201CAnd how did you end up here?\u201D\r\n\u201CI killed someone,\u201D Kaladin said, preparing his lies carefully.\r\nPlease,he thought to the Heralds.\r\nPlease.It had been a long time since he had prayed for anything.\r\nThe woman raised an eyebrow.\r\n\u201CI\u2019m a murderer, Brightness,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CGot drunk, made some mistakes. But I can use a spear as well as any man. Put me in your brightlord\u2019s army. Let me fight again.\u201D It was a strange lie to make, but the woman would never let Kaladin fight if she thought he was a deserter. In this case, better to be known as an accidental murderer.\r\nPlease\u2026he thought. To be a soldier again. It seemed, in one moment, the most glorious thing he could ever have wanted. How much better it would be to die on the battlefield than waste away emptying chamber pots.\r\nTo the side, Tvlakv stepped up beside the lighteyed woman. He glanced at Kaladin, then sighed. \u201CHe\u2019s a deserter, Brightness. Don\u2019t listen to him.\u201D\r\nNo!Kaladin felt a blazing burst of anger consume his hope. He raised hands toward Tvlakv. He\u2019d strangle the rat, and\u2014\r\nSomething cracked him across the back. He grunted, stumbling and falling to one knee. The noblewoman stepped back, raising her safehand to her breast in alarm. One of the army soldiers grabbed Kaladin and towed him back to his feet.\r\n\u201CWell,\u201D she finally said. \u201CThat is unfortunate.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\r\ncanfight,\u201D Kaladin growled against the pain. \u201CGive me a spear. Let me\u2014\u201D\r\nShe raised her rod, cutting him off.\r\n\u201CBrightness,\u201D Tvlakv said, not meeting Kaladin\u2019s eyes. \u201CI would not trust him with a weapon. It is true that he is a murderer, but he is also known to disobey and lead rebellions against his masters. I couldn\u2019t sell him to you as a bonded soldier. My conscience, it would not allow it.\u201D He hesitated. \u201CThe men in his wagon, he might have corrupted them all with talk of escape. My honor demands that I tell you this.\u201D\r\nKaladin gritted his teeth. He was tempted to try to take down the soldier behind him, grab that spear and spend his last moments ramming it through Tvlakv\u2019s portly gut. Why? What did it matter to Tvlakv how Kaladin was treated by this army?\r\nI should never have ripped up the map,Kaladin though.\r\nBitterness is repaid more often than kindness.One of his father\u2019s sayings.\r\nThe woman nodded, moving on. \u201CShow me which ones,\u201D she said. \u201CI\u2019ll still take them, because of your honesty. We need some new bridgemen.\u201D\r\nTvlakv nodded eagerly. Before moving on, he paused and leaned in to Kaladin. \u201CI cannot trust that you will behave. The people in this army, they will blame a merchant for not revealing all he knew. I\u2026am sorry.\u201D With that, the merchant scuttled away.\r\nKaladin growled in the back of his throat, and then pulled himself free of the soldiers, but remained in line. So be it. Cutting down trees, building bridges, fighting in the army. None of it mattered. He would just keep living. They\u2019d taken his freedom, his family, his friends, and\u2014most dear of all\u2014his dreams. They could do nothing more to him.\r\nAfter her inspection, the noblewoman took a writing board from her assistant and made a few quick notations on its paper. Tvlakv gave her a ledger detailing how much each slave had paid down on their slave debt. Kaladin caught a glimpse; it said that not a single one of the men had paid anything. Perhaps Tvlakv lied about the figures. Not unlikely.\r\nKaladin would probably just let all of his wages go to his debt this time. Let them squirm as they saw him actually call their bluff. What would they do if he got close to earning out his debt? He\u2019d probably never find out\u2014depending on what these bridgemen earned, it could take anything from ten to fifty years to get there.\r\nThe lighteyed woman assigned most of the slaves to forest duty. A half-dozen of the more spindly ones were sent to work the mess halls, despite what she\u2019d said before. \u201CThose ten,\u201D the noblewoman said, raising her rod to point at Kaladin and the others from his wagon. \u201CTake them to the bridge crews. Tell Lamaril and Gaz that the tall one is to be given special treatment.\u201D\r\nThe soldiers laughed, and one began shoving Kaladin\u2019s group along the pathway. Kaladin endured it; these men had no reason to be gentle, and he wouldn\u2019t give them a reason to be rougher. If there was a group citizen soldiers hated more than mercenaries, it was deserters.\r\nAs he walked, he couldn\u2019t help noticing the banner flying above the camp. It bore the same symbol emblazoned on the soldiers\u2019 uniform coats: a yellow glyphpair in the shape of a tower and a hammer on a field of deep green. That was the banner of Highprince Sadeas, ultimate ruler of Kaladin\u2019s own home district. Was it irony or fate that had landed Kaladin here?\r\nSoldiers lounged idly, even those who appeared to be on duty, and the camp streets were littered with refuse. Camp followers were plentiful: whores, worker women, coopers, chandlers, and wranglers. There were even children running through the streets of what was half city, half warcamp.\r\nThere were also parshmen. Carrying water, working on trenches, lifting sacks. That surprised him. Weren\u2019t they fighting parshmen? Weren\u2019t they worried that these would rise up? Apparently not. The parshmen here worked with the same docility as the ones back in Hearthstone. Perhaps it made sense. Alethi had fought against Alethi back in his armies at home, so why shouldn\u2019t there be parshmen on both sides of this conflict?\r\nThe soldiers took Kaladin all the way around to the northeastern quarter of the camp, a hike that took some time. Though the Soulcast stone barracks each looked exactly the same, the rim of the camp was broken distinctively, like ragged mountains. Old habits made him memorize the route. Here, the towering circular wall had been worn away by countless highstorms, giving a clear view eastward. That open patch of ground would make a good staging area for an army to gather on before marching down the incline to the Shattered Plains themselves.\r\nThe northern edge of the field contained a subcamp filled with several dozen barracks, and at their center a lumberyard filled with carpenters. They were breaking down some of the stout trees Kaladin had seen on the plains outside: stripping off their stringy bark, sawing them into planks. Another group of carpenters assembled the planks into large contraptions.\r\n\u201CWe\u2019re to be woodworkers?\u201D Kaladin asked.\r\nOne of the soldiers laughed roughly. \u201CYou\u2019re joining the bridge crews.\u201D He pointed to where a group of sorry-looking men sat on the stones in the shade of a barrack, scooping food out of wooden bowls with their fingers. It looked depressingly similar to the slop that Tvlakv had fed them.\r\nOne of the soldiers shoved Kaladin forward again, and he stumbled down the shallow incline and crossed the grounds. The other nine slaves followed, herded by the soldiers. None of the men sitting around the barracks so much as glanced at them. They wore leather vests and simple trousers, some with dirty laced shirts, others bare-chested. The grim, sorry lot weren\u2019t much better than the slaves, though they did look to be in slightly better physical condition.\r\n\u201CNew recruits, Gaz,\u201D one of the soldiers called.\r\nA man lounged in the shade a distance from the eating men. He turned, revealing a face that was so scarred his beard grew in patches. He was missing one eye\u2014the other was brown\u2014and didn\u2019t bother with an eye patch. White knots at his shoulders marked him as a sergeant, and he had the lean toughness Kaladin had learned to associate with someone who knew his way around a battlefield.\r\n\u201CThese spindly things?\u201D Gaz said, chewing on something as he walked over. \u201CThey\u2019ll barely stop an arrow.\u201D\r\nThe soldier beside Kaladin shrugged, shoving him forward once more for good measure. \u201CBrightness Hashal said to do something special with this one. The rest are up to you.\u201D The soldier nodded to his companions, and they began to trot away.\r\nGaz looked the slaves over. He focused on Kaladin last.\r\n\u201CI have military training,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CIn the army of Highlord Amaram.\u201D\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t really care,\u201D Gaz cut in, spitting something dark to the side.\r\nKaladin hesitated. \u201CWhen Amaram\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CYou keep mentioning that name,\u201D Gaz snapped. \u201CServed under some unimportant landlord, did you? Expect me to be impressed?\u201D\r\nKaladin sighed. He\u2019d met this kind of man before, a lesser sergeant with no hope of advancement. His only pleasure in life came from his authority over those even sorrier than himself. Well, so be it.\r\n\u201CYou have a slave\u2019s mark,\u201D Gaz said, snorting. \u201CI doubt you ever held a spear. Either way, you\u2019ll have to condescend to join us now, Lordship.\u201D\r\nKaladin\u2019s windspren flitted down and inspected Gaz, then closed one of her eyes, imitating him. For some reason, seeing her made Kaladin smile. Gaz misinterpreted the smile. The man scowled and stepped forward, pointing.\r\nAt that moment, a loud chorus of horns echoed through the camp. Carpenters glanced up, and the soldiers who had guided Kaladin dashed back toward the center of camp. The slaves behind Kaladin looked around anxiously.\r\n\u201CStormfather!\u201D Gaz cursed. \u201CBridgemen! Up, up, you louts!\u201D He began kicking at some of the men who were eating. They scattered their bowls, scrambling to their feet. They wore simple sandals instead of proper boots.\r\n\u201CYou, Lordship,\u201D Gaz said, pointing at Kaladin.\r\n\u201CI didn\u2019t say\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t care what in Damnation you said! You\u2019re in Bridge Four.\u201D He pointed at a group of departing bridgemen. \u201CThe rest of you, go wait over there. I\u2019ll divide you up later. Get moving, or I\u2019ll see you strung up by your heels.\u201D\r\nKaladin shrugged and jogged after the group of bridgemen. It was one of many teams of such men pouring out of barracks or picking themselves up out of alleys. There seemed to be quite a lot of them. Around fifty barracks, with\u2014perhaps\u2014twenty or thirty men in each\u2026that would make nearly as many bridgemen in this army as there had been soldiers in Amaram\u2019s entire force.\r\nKaladin\u2019s team crossed the grounds, weaving between boards and piles of sawdust, approaching a large wooden contraption. It had obviously weathered a few highstorms and some battles. The dents and holes scattered along its length looked like places where arrows had struck. The bridge in bridgeman, perhaps?\r\nYes,Kaladin thought. It was a wooden bridge, around thirty feet long, eight feet wide. It sloped down at the front and back, and had no railings. The wood was thick, with the largest boards for support through the center. There were some forty or fifty bridges lined up here. Perhaps one for each barrack, making one crew for each bridge? About twenty bridge crews were gathering at this point.\r\nGaz had found himself a wooden shield and a gleaming mace, but there were none for anyone else. He quickly inspected each team. He stopped beside Bridge Four and hesitated. \u201CWhere\u2019s your bridgeleader?\u201D he demanded.\r\n\u201CDead,\u201D one of the bridgemen said. \u201CTossed himself down the Honor Chasm last night.\u201D\r\nGaz cursed. \u201CCan\u2019t you keep a bridgeleader for even a week? Storm it! Line up; I\u2019ll run near you. Listen for my commands. We\u2019ll sort out another bridgeleader after we see who survives.\u201D Gaz pointed at Kaladin. \u201CYou\u2019re at the back, lordling. The rest of you, get moving! Storm you, I won\u2019t suffer another reprimand because of you fools! Move, move!\u201D\r\nThe others were lifting. Kaladin had no choice but to go to the open slot at the tail of the bridge. He\u2019d been a little low in his assessment; looked like about thirty-five to forty men per bridge. There was room for five men across\u2014three under the bridge and one on each side\u2014and eight deep, though this crew didn\u2019t have a man for each position.\r\nHe helped lift the bridge into the air. They were probably using a very light wood for the bridges, but the thing was still storms-cursed heavy. Kaladin grunted as he struggled with the weight, hoisting the bridge up high and then stepping underneath. Men dashed in to fill the middle slots down the length of the structure, and slowly they all set the bridge down on their shoulders. At least there were rods on the bottom to use as handholds.\r\nThe other men had pads on the shoulders of their vests to cushion the weight and adjust their height to fit the supports. Kaladin hadn\u2019t been given a vest, so the wooden supports dug directly into his skin. He couldn\u2019t see a thing; there was an indentation for his head, but wood cut off his view to all sides. The men at the edges had better views; he suspected those spots were more coveted.\r\nThe wood smelled of oil and sweat.\r\n\u201CGo!\u201D Gaz said from outside, voice muffled.\r\nKaladin grunted as the crew broke into a jog. He couldn\u2019t see where he was going, and struggled to keep from tripping as the bridge crew marched down the eastern slope to the Shattered Plains. Soon, Kaladin was sweating and cursing under his breath, the wood rubbing and digging into the skin on his shoulders. He was already starting to bleed.\r\n\u201CPoor fool,\u201D a voice said from the side.\r\nKaladin glanced to the right, but the wooden handholds obstructed his view. \u201CAre you\u2026\u201D Kaladin puffed. \u201CAre you talking to me?\u201D\r\n\u201CYou shouldn\u2019t have insulted Gaz,\u201D the man said. His voice sounded hollow. \u201CHe sometimes lets new men run in an outside row. Sometimes.\u201D\r\nKaladin tried to respond, but he was already gasping for breath. He\u2019d thought himself in better shape than this, but he\u2019d spent eight months being fed slop, being beaten, and waiting out highstorms in leaking cellars, muddy barns, or cages. He was hardly the same man anymore.\r\n\u201CBreathe in and out deeply,\u201D said the muffled voice. \u201CFocus on the steps. Count them. It helps.\u201D\r\nKaladin followed the advice. He could hear other bridge crews running nearby. Behind them came the familiar sounds of men marching and hoofbeats on the stone. They were being followed by an army.\r\nBelow, rockbuds and small shalebark ridges grew from the stone, tripping him. The landscape of the Shattered Plains appeared to be broken, uneven, and rent, covered with outcroppings and shelves of rock. That explained why they didn\u2019t use wheels on the bridges\u2014porters were probably much faster over such rough terrain.\r\nSoon, his feet were ragged and battered. Couldn\u2019t they have given him shoes? He set his jaw against the agony and kept on going. Just another job. He would continue, and he would survive.\r\nA thumping sound. His feet fell on wood. A bridge, a permanent one, crossing a chasm between plateaus on the Shattered Plains. In seconds the bridge crew was across it, and his feet fell on stone again.\r\n\u201CMove, move!\u201D Gaz bellowed. \u201CStorm you, keep going!\u201D\r\nThey continued jogging as the army crossed the bridge behind them, hundreds of boots resounding on the wood. Before too long, blood ran down Kaladin\u2019s shoulders. His breathing was torturous, his side aching painfully. He could hear others gasping, the sounds carrying through the confined space beneath the bridge. So he wasn\u2019t the only one. Hopefully, they would arrive at their destination quickly.\r\nHe hoped in vain.\r\nThe next hour was torture. It was worse than any beating he\u2019d suffered as a slave, worse than any wound on the battlefield. There seemed to be no end to the march. Kaladin vaguely remembered seeing the permanent bridges, back when he\u2019d looked down on the plains from the slave cart. They connected the plateaus where the chasms were easiest to span, not where it would be most efficient for those traveling. That often meant detours north or south before they could continue eastward.\r\nThe bridgemen grumbled, cursed, groaned, then fell silent. They crossed bridge after bridge, plateau after plateau. Kaladin never got a good look at one of the chasms. He just kept running. And running. He couldn\u2019t feel his feet any longer. He kept running. He knew, somehow, that if he stopped, he\u2019d be beaten. He felt as if his shoulders had been rubbed to the bone. He tried counting steps, but was too exhausted even for that.\r\nBut he didn\u2019t stop running.\r\nFinally, mercifully, Gaz called for them to halt. Kaladin blinked, stumbling to a stop and nearly collapsing.\r\n\u201CLift!\u201D Gaz bellowed.\r\nThe men lifted, Kaladin\u2019s arms straining at the motion after so much time holding the bridge in one place.\r\n\u201CDrop!\u201D\r\nThey stepped aside, the bridgemen underneath taking handholds at the sides. It was awkward and difficult, but these men had practice, apparently. They kept the bridge from toppling as they set it on the ground.\r\n\u201CPush!\u201D\r\nKaladin stumbled back in confusion as the men pushed at their handholds on the side or back of the bridge. They were at the edge of a chasm lacking a permanent bridge. To the sides, the other bridge crews were pushing their own bridges forward.\r\nKaladin glanced over his shoulder. The army was two thousand men in forest green and pure white. Twelve hundred darkeyed spearmen, several hundred cavalry atop rare, precious horses. Behind them, a large group of heavy foot, lighteyed men in thick armor and carrying large maces and square steel shields.\r\nIt seemed that they\u2019d intentionally chosen a point where the chasm was narrow and the first plateau was a little higher than the second. The bridge was twice as long as the chasm\u2019s width here. Gaz cursed at him, so Kaladin joined the others, shoving the bridge across the rough ground with a scraping sound. When the bridge thumped into place on the other side of the chasm, the bridge crew drew back to let the cavalry trot across.\r\nHe was too exhausted to watch. He collapsed to the stones and lay back, listening to sounds of foot soldiers tromping across the bridge. He rolled his head to the side. The other bridgemen had lain down as well. Gaz walked among the various crews, shaking his head, his shield on his back as he muttered about their worthlessness.\r\nKaladin longed to lie there, staring at the sky, oblivious of the world. His training, however, warned that might cause him to cramp up. That would make the return trip even worse. That training\u2026it belonged to another man, from another time. Almost from the shadowdays. But while Kaladin might not\r\nbehim any longer, he could still\r\nheedhim.\r\nAnd so, with a groan, Kaladin forced himself to sit up and begin rubbing his muscles. Soldiers crossed the bridge four across, spears held high, shields forward. Gaz watched them with obvious envy, and Kaladin\u2019s windspren danced around the man\u2019s head. Despite his fatigue, Kaladin felt a moment of jealousy. Why was she bothering that blowhard instead of Kaladin?\r\nAfter a few minutes, Gaz noticed Kaladin and scowled at him.\r\n\u201CHe\u2019s wondering why you aren\u2019t lying down,\u201D said a familiar voice. The man who had been running beside Kaladin lay on the ground a short distance away, staring up at the sky. He was older, with greying hair, and he had a long, leathery face to complement his kindly voice. He looked as exhausted as Kaladin felt.\r\nKaladin kept rubbing his legs, pointedly ignoring Gaz. Then he ripped off some portions of his sacklike clothing and bound his feet and shoulders. Fortunately, he was accustomed to walking barefoot as a slave, so the damage wasn\u2019t too bad.\r\nAs he finished, the last of the foot soldiers passed over the bridge. They were followed by several mounted lighteyes in gleaming armor. At their center rode a man in majestic, burnished red Shardplate. It was distinct from the one other Kaladin had seen\u2014each suit was said to be an individual work of art\u2014but it had the same\r\nfeel. Ornate, interlocking, topped by a beautiful helm with an open visor.\r\nThe armor felt\r\naliensomehow. It had been crafted in another epoch, a time when gods had walked Roshar.\r\n\u201CIs that the king?\u201D Kaladin asked.\r\nThe leathery bridgeman laughed tiredly. \u201CWe could only wish.\u201D\r\nKaladin turned toward him, frowning.\r\n\u201CIf that were the king,\u201D the bridgeman said, \u201Cthen that would mean we were in Brightlord Dalinar\u2019s army.\u201D\r\nThe name was vaguely familiar to Kaladin. \u201CHe\u2019s a highprince, right? The king\u2019s uncle?\u201D\r\n\u201CAye. The best of men, the most honorable Shardbearer in the king\u2019s army. They say he\u2019s never broken his word.\u201D\r\nKaladin sniffed in disdain. Much the same had been said about Amaram.\r\n\u201CYou should wish to be in Highprince Dalinar\u2019s force, lad,\u201D the older man said. \u201CHe doesn\u2019t use bridge crews. Not like these, at least.\u201D\r\n\u201CAll right, you cremlings!\u201D Gaz bellowed. \u201COn your feet!\u201D\r\nThe bridgemen groaned, stumbling upright. Kaladin sighed. The brief rest had been just enough to show how exhausted he was. \u201CI\u2019ll be glad to get back,\u201D he muttered.\r\n\u201CBack?\u201D the leathery bridgeman said.\r\n\u201CWe aren\u2019t turning around?\u201D\r\nHis friend chuckled wryly. \u201CLad, we aren\u2019t\r\nnearlythere yet. Be glad we aren\u2019t. Arriving is the worst part.\u201D\r\nAnd so the nightmare began its second phase. They crossed the bridge, pulled it over behind them, then lifted it up on sore shoulders once more. They jogged across the plateau. At the other side, they lowered the bridge again to span another chasm. The army crossed, then it was back to carrying the bridge again.\r\nThey repeated this a good dozen times. They did get to rest between carries, but Kaladin was so sore and overworked that the brief respites weren\u2019t enough. He barely caught his breath each time before being forced to pick up the bridge again.\r\nThey were expected to be quick about it. The bridgemen got to rest while the army crossed, but they had to make up the time by jogging across the plateaus\u2014passing the ranks of soldiers\u2014so that they could arrive at the next chasm before the army. At one point, his leathery-faced friend warned him that if they didn\u2019t have their bridge in place quickly enough, they\u2019d be punished with whippings when they returned to camp.\r\nGaz gave orders, cursing the bridgemen, kicking them when they moved too slowly, never doing any real work. It didn\u2019t take long for Kaladin to nurture a seething hatred of the scrawny, scarfaced man. That was odd; he hadn\u2019t felt hatred for his other sergeants. It was their\r\njobto curse at the men and keep them motivated.\r\nThat wasn\u2019t what burned Kaladin. Gaz had sent him on this trip without sandals or a vest. Despite his bandages, Kaladin would bear scars from his work this day. He\u2019d be so bruised and stiff in the morning that he\u2019d be unable to walk.\r\nWhat Gaz had done was the mark of a petty bully. He risked the mission by losing a carrier, all because of a hasty grudge.\r\nStorming man,Kaladin thought, using his hatred of Gaz to sustain him through the ordeal. Several times after pushing the bridge into place, Kaladin collapsed, feeling sure he\u2019d never be able to stand again. But when Gaz called for them to rise, Kaladin somehow struggled to his feet. It was either that or let Gaz win.\r\nWhy were they going through all of this? What was the point? Why were they running so much? They had to protect their bridge, the precious weight, the cargo. They had to hold up the sky and run, they had to\u2026\r\nHe was growing delirious. Feet, running. One, two, one, two, one, two.\r\n\u201CStop!\u201D\r\nHe stopped.\r\n\u201CLift!\u201D\r\nHe raised his hands up.\r\n\u201CDrop!\u201D\r\nHe stepped back, then lowered the bridge.\r\n\u201CPush!\u201D\r\nHe pushed the bridge.\r\nDie.\r\nThat last command was his own, added each time. He fell back to the stone, a rockbud hastily withdrawing its vines as he touched them. He closed his eyes, no longer able to care about cramps. He entered a trance, a kind of half sleep, for what seemed like one heartbeat.\r\n\u201CRise!\u201D\r\nHe stood, stumbling on bloody feet.\r\n\u201CCross!\u201D\r\nHe crossed, not bothering to look at the deadly drop on either side.\r\n\u201CPull!\u201D\r\nHe grabbed a handhold and pulled the bridge across the chasm after him.\r\n\u201CSwitch!\u201D\r\nKaladin stood up dumbly. He didn\u2019t understand that command; Gaz had never given it before. The troops were forming ranks, moving with that mixture of skittishness and forced relaxation that men often went through before a battle. A few anticipationspren\u2014like red streamers, growing from the ground and whipping in the wind\u2014began to sprout from the rock and wave among the soldiers.\r\nA battle?\r\nGaz grabbed Kaladin\u2019s shoulder and shoved him to the front of the bridge. \u201CNewcomers get to go first at this part, Your Lordship.\u201D The sergeant smiled wickedly.\r\nKaladin dumbly picked up the bridge with the others, raising it over his head. The handholds were the same here, but this front row had a notched opening before his face, allowing him to see out. All of the bridgemen had changed positions; the men who had been running in the front moved to the back, and those at the back\u2014including Kaladin and the leathery-faced bridgeman\u2014moved to the front.\r\nKaladin didn\u2019t ask the point of it. He didn\u2019t care. He liked the front, though; jogging was easier now that he could see ahead of him.\r\nThe landscape on the plateaus was that of rough stormlands; there were scattered patches of grass, but the stone here was too hard for their seeds to fully burrow into. Rockbuds were more common, growing like bubbles across the entire plateau, imitating rocks about the size of a man\u2019s head. Many of the buds were split, trailing out their vines like thick green tongues. A few were even in bloom.\r\nAfter so many hours breathing in the stuffy confines beneath the bridge, running in the front was almost relaxing. Why had they given such a wonderful position to a newcomer?\r\n\u201CTalenelat\u2019Elin, bearer of all agonies,\u201D said the man to his right, voice horrified. \u201CIt\u2019s going to be a bad one. They\u2019re already lined up! It\u2019s going to be a bad one!\u201D\r\nKaladin blinked, focusing on the approaching chasm. On the other side of the rift stood a rank of men with marbled crimson and black skin. They were wearing a strange rusty orange armor that covered their forearms, chests, heads, and legs. It took his numbed mind a moment to understand.\r\nThe Parshendi.\r\nThey weren\u2019t like common parshman workers. They were far more muscular, far more\r\nsolid. They had the bulky build of soldiers, and each one carried a weapon strapped to his back. Some wore dark red and black beards tied with bits of rock, while others were clean-shaven.\r\nAs Kaladin watched, the front row of Parshendi knelt down. They held shortbows, arrows nocked. Not longbows intended to launch arrows high and far. Short, recurve bows to fire straight and quick and strong. An excellent bow to use for killing a group of bridgemen before they could lay their bridge.\r\nArriving is the worst part\u2026.\r\nNow, finally, the\r\nrealnightmare began.\r\nGaz hung back, bellowing at the bridge crews to keep going. Kaladin\u2019s instincts screamed at him to get out of the line of fire, but the momentum of the bridge forced him forward. Forced him down the throat of the beast itself, its teeth poised to snap closed.\r\nKaladin\u2019s exhaustion and pain fled. He was shocked alert. The bridges charged forward, the men beneath them screaming as they ran. Ran toward death.\r\nThe archers released.\r\nThe first wave killed Kaladin\u2019s leathery-faced friend, dropping him with three separate arrows. The man to Kaladin\u2019s left fell as well\u2014Kaladin hadn\u2019t even seen his face. That man cried out as he dropped, not dead immediately, but the bridge crew trampled him. The bridge got noticeably heavier as men died.\r\nThe Parshendi calmly drew a second volley and launched. To the side, Kaladin barely noticed another of the bridge crews floundering. The Parshendi seemed to focus their fire on certain crews. That one got a full wave of arrows from dozens of archers, and the first three rows of bridgemen dropped and tripped those behind them. Their bridge lurched, skidding on the ground and making a sickening crunch as the mass of bodies fell over one another.\r\nArrows zipped past Kaladin, killing the other two men in the front line with him. Several other arrows smacked into the wood around him, one slicing open the skin of his cheek.\r\nHe screamed. In horror, in shock, in pain, in sheer bewilderment. Never before had he felt so powerless in a battle. He\u2019d charged enemy fortifications, he\u2019d run beneath waves of arrows, but he\u2019d always felt a measure of control. He\u2019d had his spear, he\u2019d had his shield, he could fight back.\r\nNot this time. The bridge crews were like hogs running to the slaughter.\r\nA third volley flew, and another of the twenty bridge crews fell. Waves of arrows came from the Alethi side as well, falling and striking the Parshendi. Kaladin\u2019s bridge was almost to the chasm. He could see the black eyes of the Parshendi on the other side, could make out the features of their lean marbled faces. All around him, bridgemen were screaming in pain, arrows cutting them out from underneath their bridges. There was a crashing sound as another bridge dropped, its bridgemen slaughtered.\r\nBehind, Gaz called out. \u201CLift and down, you fools!\u201D\r\nThe bridge crew lurched to a stop as the Parshendi launched another volley. Men behind Kaladin screamed. The Parshendi firing was interrupted by a return volley from the Alethi army. Though he was shocked senseless, Kaladin\u2019s reflexes knew what do to. Drop the bridge, get into position to push.\r\nThis exposed the bridgemen who had been safe in the back ranks. The Parshendi archers obviously knew this was coming; they prepared and launched one final volley. Arrows struck the bridge in a wave, dropping a half-dozen men, spraying blood across the dark wood. Fearspren\u2014wiggling and violet\u2014sprang up through the wood and wriggled in the air. The bridge lurched, growing much harder to push as they suddenly lost those men.\r\nKaladin stumbled, hands slipping. He fell to his knees and pitched out, leaning over the chasm. He barely managed to catch himself.\r\nHe teetered, one hand dangling above the void, the other gripping the edge. His overextended mind wavered with vertigo as he stared down that sheer cliff, down into darkness. The height was beautiful; he\u2019d always loved climbing high rock formations with Tien.\r\nBy reflex, he shoved himself back onto the plateau, scrambling backward. A group of foot soldiers, protected by shields, had taken up positions pushing the bridge. The army\u2019s archers exchanged arrows with the Parshendi as the soldiers pushed the bridge into place and heavy cavalry thundered across, smashing into the Parshendi. Four bridges had fallen, but sixteen had been placed in a row, allowing for an effective charge.\r\nKaladin tried to move, tried to crawl away from the bridge. But he just collapsed where he was, his body refusing to obey. He couldn\u2019t even roll over onto his stomach.\r\nI should go\u2026he thought in exhaustion.\r\nSee if that leathery-faced man is still alive\u2026. Bind his wounds\u2026. Save\u2026.\r\nBut he couldn\u2019t. He couldn\u2019t move. Couldn\u2019t think. To his shame, he just let himself close his eyes and gave himself over to unconsciousness.\r\n\u201CKaladin.\u201D\r\nHe didn\u2019t want to open his eyes. To wake meant returning to that awful world of pain. A world where defenseless, exhausted men were made to charge lines of archers.\r\nThat world was the nightmare.\r\n\u201CKaladin!\u201D The feminine voice was soft, like a whisper, yet still urgent. \u201CThey\u2019re going to leave you. Get up! You\u2019ll die!\u201D\r\nI can\u2019t\u2026I can\u2019t go back\u2026.\r\nLet me go.\r\nSomething snapped against his face, a slight\r\nslapof energy with a sting to it. He cringed. It was nothing compared with his other pains, but somehow it was far more demanding. He raised a hand, swatting. The motion was enough to drive away the last vestiges of stupor.\r\nHe tried to open his eyes. One refused, blood from a cut on his cheek having run down and crusted around the eyelid. The sun had moved. Hours had passed. He groaned\u2014sitting up, rubbing the dried blood from his eye. The ground near him was littered with bodies. The air smelled of blood and worse.\r\nA pair of sorry bridgemen were shaking each man in turn, checking for life, then pulling the vests and sandals off their bodies, shooing away the cremlings feeding on the bodies. The men would never have checked on Kaladin. He didn\u2019t have anything for them to take. They\u2019d have left him with the corpses, stranded on the plateau.\r\nKaladin\u2019s windspren flitted through the air above him, moving anxiously. He rubbed his jaw where she\u2019d struck him. Large spren like her could move small objects and give little pinches of energy. That made them all the more annoying.\r\nThis time, it had probably saved Kaladin\u2019s life. He groaned at all the places where he hurt. \u201CDo you have a name, spirit?\u201D he asked, forcing himself to his battered feet.\r\nOn the plateau the army had crossed to, soldiers were picking through the corpses of the dead Parshendi, looking for something. Harvesting equipment, maybe? It appeared that Sadeas\u2019s force had won. At least, there didn\u2019t seem to be any Parshendi still alive. They\u2019d either been killed or had fled.\r\nThe plateau they\u2019d fought on seemed exactly like the others they\u2019d crossed. The only thing that was different here was that there was a large lump of\u2026something in the center of the plateau. It looked like an enormous rockbud, perhaps some kind of chrysalis or shell, a good twenty feet tall. One side had been hacked open, exposing slimy innards. He hadn\u2019t noticed it on the initial charge; the archers had demanded all of his attention.\r\n\u201CA name,\u201D the windspren said, her voice distant. \u201CYes. I\r\ndohave a name.\u201D She seemed surprised as she looked at Kaladin. \u201CWhy do I have a name?\u201D\r\n\u201CHow should I know?\u201D Kaladin said, forcing himself to move. His feet blazed with pain. He could barely limp.\r\nThe nearby bridgemen looked to him with surprise, but he ignored them, limping across the plateau until he found the corpse of a bridgeman who still had his vest and shoes. It was the leathery-faced man who had been so kind to him, dead with an arrow through the neck. Kaladin ignored those shocked eyes, staring blankly into the sky, and harvested the man\u2019s clothing\u2014leather vest, leather sandals, lacing shirt stained red with blood. Kaladin felt disgusted with himself, but he wasn\u2019t going to count on Gaz giving him clothing.\r\nKaladin sat down and used the cleaner parts of the shirt to change his improvised bandages, then put on the vest and sandals, trying to keep from moving too much. A breeze now blew, carrying away the scents of blood and the sounds of soldiers calling to one another. The cavalry was already forming up, as if eager to return.\r\n\u201CA name,\u201D the windspren said, walking through the air to stand beside his face. She was in the shape of a young woman, complete with flowing skirt and delicate feet. \u201CSylphrena.\u201D\r\n\u201CSylphrena,\u201D Kaladin repeated, tying on the sandals.\r\n\u201CSyl,\u201D the spirit said. She cocked her head. \u201CThat\u2019s amusing. It appears that I have a nickname.\u201D\r\n\u201CCongratulations.\u201D Kaladin stood up again, wobbling.\r\nTo the side, Gaz stood with hands on hips, shield tied to his back. \u201CYou,\u201D he said, pointing at Kaladin. He then gestured to the bridge.\r\n\u201CYou\u2019ve got to be kidding,\u201D Kaladin said, looking as the remnants of the bridge crew\u2014fewer than half of their previous number remained\u2014gathered around the bridge.\r\n\u201CEither carry or stay behind,\u201D Gaz said. He seemed angry about something.\r\nI was supposed to die,Kaladin realized.\r\nThat\u2019s why he didn\u2019t care if I had a vest or sandals. I was at the front.Kaladin was the only one on the first row who had lived.\r\nKaladin nearly sat down and let them leave him. But dying of thirst on a lonely plateau was not the way he\u2019d choose to go. He stumbled over to the bridge.\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t worry,\u201D said one of the other bridgemen. \u201CThey\u2019ll let us go slow this time, take lots of breaks. And we\u2019ll have a few soldiers to help\u2014takes at least twenty-five men to lift a bridge.\u201D\r\nKaladin sighed, getting into place as some unfortunate soldiers joined them. Together, they heaved the bridge into the air. It was terribly heavy, but they managed it, somehow.\r\nKaladin walked, feeling numb. He\u2019d thought that there was nothing more life could do to him, nothing worse than the slave\u2019s brand with a\r\nshash, nothing worse than losing all he had to the war, nothing more terrible than failing those he\u2019d sworn to protect.\r\nIt appeared that he\u2019d been wrong. There\r\nhadbeen something more they could do to him. One final torment the world had reserved just for Kaladin.\r\nAnd it was called Bridge Four."

      "ChapterName": "7: ANYTHING REASONABLE",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\n\u201CThey are aflame. They burn. They bring the darkness when they come, and so all you can see is that their skin is aflame. Burn, burn, burn\u2026.\u201D\r\n\u2014Collected on Palahishev, 1172, 21 seconds pre-death. Subject was a baker\u2019s apprentice.\r\nShallan hurried down the hallway with its burnt-orange colorings, the ceiling and upper walls now stained by the passing of black smoke from Jasnah\u2019s Soulcasting. Hopefully, the paintings on the walls hadn\u2019t been ruined.\r\nAhead, a small group of parshmen arrived, bearing rags, buckets, and stepladders to use in wiping off the soot. They bowed to her as she passed, uttering no words. Parshmen could speak, but they rarely did so. Many seemed mute. As a child, she\u2019d found the patterns of their marbled skin beautiful. That had been before her father forbade her to spend any time with the parshmen.\r\nShe turned her mind to her task. How was she going to convince Jasnah Kholin, one of the most powerful women in the world, to change her mind about taking Shallan as a ward? The woman was obviously stubborn; she had spent years resisting the devotaries\u2019 attempts at reconciliation.\r\nShe reentered the broad main cavern, with its lofty stone ceiling and bustling, well-dressed occupants. She felt daunted, but that brief glimpse of the Soulcaster seduced her. Her family, House Davar, had prospered in recent years, coming out of obscurity. This had primarily been because of her father\u2019s skill in politics\u2014he had been hated by many, but his ruthlessness had carried him far. So had the wealth lent by the discovery of several important new marble deposits on Davar lands.\r\nShallan had never known enough to be suspicious of that wealth\u2019s origins. Every time the family had exhausted one of its quarries, her father had gone out with his surveyor and discovered a new one. Only after interrogating the surveyor had Shallan and her brothers discovered the truth: Her father, using his forbidden Soulcaster, had been\r\ncreatingnew deposits at a careful rate. Not enough to be suspicious. Just enough to give him the money he needed to further his political goals.\r\nNobody knew where he\u2019d gotten the fabrial, which she now carried in her safepouch. It was unusable, damaged on the same disastrous evening that her father had died.\r\nDon\u2019t think about that,she told herself forcefully.\r\nThey\u2019d had a jeweler repair the broken Soulcaster, but it no longer worked. Their house steward\u2014one of her father\u2019s close confidants, an advisor named Luesh\u2014had been trained to use the device, and he could no longer make it function.\r\nHer father\u2019s debts and promises were outrageous. Their choices were limited. Her family had some time\u2014perhaps as long as a year\u2014before the missed payments became egregious, and before her father\u2019s absence became obvious. For once, her family\u2019s isolated, backcountry estates were an advantage, providing a reason that communications were being delayed. Her brothers were scrambling, writing letters in her father\u2019s name, making a few appearances and spreading rumors that Brightlord Davar was planning something big.\r\nAll to give her time to make good on her bold plan. Find Jasnah Kholin. Become her ward. Learn where she kept her Soulcaster. Then replace it with the nonfunctional one.\r\nWith the fabrial, they\u2019d be able to make new quarries and restore their wealth. They\u2019d be able to make food to feed their house soldiers. With enough wealth in hand to pay off debts and make bribes, they could announce their father\u2019s death and not suffer destruction.\r\nShallan hesitated in the main hallway, considering her next move. What she planned to do was very risky. She\u2019d have to escape without implicating herself in the theft. Though she\u2019d devoted much thought to that, she still didn\u2019t know how she\u2019d manage it. But Jasnah was known to have many enemies. There had to be a way to pin the fabrial\u2019s \u201Cbreaking\u201D on them instead.\r\nThat step would come later. For now, Shallan\r\nhadto convince Jasnah to accept her as a ward. All other results were unacceptable.\r\nNervously, Shallan held her arms in the sign of need, covered safehand bent across her chest and touching the elbow of her freehand, which was raised with fingers outspread. A woman approached, wearing the well-starched white laced shirt and black skirt that were the universal sign of a master-servant.\r\nThe stout woman curtsied. \u201CBrightness?\u201D\r\n\u201CThe Palanaeum,\u201D Shallan said.\r\nThe woman bowed and led Shallan farther into the depths of the long hallway. Most of the women here\u2014servants included\u2014wore their hair bound, and Shallan felt conspicuous with hers loose. The deep red color made her stand out even more.\r\nSoon, the grand hallway began to slope down steeply. But when the half-hour arrived, she could still hear distant bells ring behind her. Perhaps that was why the people here liked them so much; even in the depths of the Conclave, one could hear the outside world.\r\nThe servant led Shallan to a pair of grand steel doors. The servant bowed and Shallan dismissed her with a nod.\r\nShallan couldn\u2019t help but admire the beauty of the doors; their exterior was carved in an intricate geometric pattern with circles and lines and glyphs. It was some kind of chart, half on each door. There was no time to study the details, unfortunately, and she passed them by.\r\nBeyond the doors was a breathtakingly large room. The sides were of smooth rock and they stretched high; the dim illumination made it impossible to tell just how high, but she saw flickers of distant light. Set into the walls were dozens of small balconies, much like the private box seats of a theater. Soft light shone from many of these. The only sounds were turning pages and faint whispers. Shallan raised her safehand to her breast, feeling dwarfed by the magnificent chamber.\r\n\u201CBrightness?\u201D a young male master-servant said, approaching. \u201CWhat do you need?\u201D\r\n\u201CA new sense of perspective, apparently,\u201D Shallan said absently. \u201CHow\u2026\u201D\r\n\u201CThis room is called the Veil,\u201D the servant explained softly. \u201CThat which comes before the Palanaeum itself. Both were here when the city was founded. Some think these chambers might have been cut by the Dawnsingers themselves.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhere are the books?\u201D\r\n\u201CThe Palanaeum proper is this way.\u201D The servant gestured, leading her to a set of doors on the other side of the room. Through them, she entered a smaller chamber that was partitioned with walls of thick crystal. Shallan approached the nearest one, feeling it. The crystal\u2019s surface was rough like hewn rock.\r\n\u201CSoulcast?\u201D she asked.\r\nThe servant nodded. Behind him, another servant passed leading an elderly ardent. Like most ardents, the aged man had a shaved head and a long beard. His simple grey robes were tied with a brown sash. The servant led him around a corner, and Shallan could vaguely make out their shapes on the other side, shadows swimming through the crystal.\r\nShe took a step forward, but her servant cleared his throat. \u201CI will need your chit of admittance, Brightness.\u201D\r\n\u201CHow much does one cost?\u201D Shallan asked hesitantly.\r\n\u201CA thousand sapphire broams.\u201D\r\n\u201CSo much?\u201D\r\n\u201CThe king\u2019s many hospitals require much upkeep,\u201D the man said apologetically. \u201CThe only things Kharbranth has to sell are fish, bells, and information. The first two are hardly unique to us. But the third\u2026well, the Palanaeum has the finest collection of tomes and scrolls on Roshar. More, even, than the Holy Enclave in Valath. At last count, there were over seven hundred thousand separate texts in our archive.\u201D\r\nHer father had owned exactly eighty-seven books. Shallan had read them all several times over. How much could be contained in\r\nseven hundred thousandbooks? The weight of that much information dazzled her. She found herself hungering to look through those hidden shelves. She could spend months just reading their titles.\r\nBut no. Perhaps once she\u2019d made certain her brothers were safe\u2014once her house\u2019s finances were restored\u2014she could return. Perhaps.\r\nShe felt like she was starving, yet leaving a warm fruit pie uneaten. \u201CWhere might I wait?\u201D she asked. \u201CIf someone I know is inside.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou may use one of the reading alcoves,\u201D the servant said, relaxing. Perhaps he\u2019d feared that she would make a scene. \u201CNo chit is required to sit in one. There are parshman porters who will raise you to the higher levels, if that is what you wish.\u201D\r\n\u201CThank you,\u201D Shallan said, turning her back on the Palanaeum. She felt like a child again, locked in her room, not allowed to run through the gardens because of her father\u2019s paranoid fears. \u201CDoes Brightness Jasnah have an alcove yet?\u201D\r\n\u201CI can ask,\u201D the servant said, leading the way back into the Veil, with its distant, unseen ceiling. He hurried off to speak with some others, leaving Shallan standing beside the doorway to the Palanaeum.\r\nShe could run in. Sneak through\u2014\r\nNo. Her brothers teased her for being too timid, but it was not timidity that held her back. There would undoubtedly be guards; bursting in would not only be futile, it would ruin any chance she had of changing Jasnah\u2019s mind.\r\nChange Jasnah\u2019s mind, prove herself. Considering it made her sick. She\r\nhatedconfrontation. During her youth, she\u2019d felt like a piece of delicate crystalware, locked in a cabinet to be displayed but never touched. The only daughter, the last memory of Brightlord Davar\u2019s beloved wife. It still felt odd to her that\r\nshebeen the one to take charge after\u2026After the incident\u2026After\u2026\r\nMemories attacked her. Nan Balat bruised, his coat torn. A long, silvery sword in her hand, sharp enough to cut stones as if they were water.\r\nNo,Shallan thought, her back to the stone wall, clutching her satchel.\r\nNo. Don\u2019t think of the past.\r\nShe sought solace in drawing, raising fingers to her satchel and reaching for her paper and pencils. The servant came back before she had a chance to get them out, however. \u201CBrightness Jasnah Kholin has indeed asked that a reading alcove be set aside for her,\u201D he said. \u201CYou may wait there for her, if you wish it.\u201D\r\n\u201CI do,\u201D Shallan said. \u201CThank you.\u201D\r\nThe servant led her to a shadowed enclosure, inside of which four parshmen stood upon a sturdy wooden platform. The servant and Shallan stepped onto the platform, and the parshmen pulled ropes that were strung into a pulley above, raising the platform up the stone shaft. The only lights were broam spheres set at each corner of the lift\u2019s ceiling. Amethysts, which had a soft violet light.\r\nShe needed a plan. Jasnah Kholin did not seem the type to change her mind easily. Shallan would have to surprise her, impress her.\r\nThey reached a level about forty feet or so off the ground, and the servant waved for the porters to stop. Shallan followed the master-servant down a dark hallway to one of the small balconies that extended out over the Veil. It was round, like a turret, and had a waist-high stone rim with a wooden railing above that. Other occupied alcoves glowed with different colors from the spheres being used to light them; the darkness of the huge space made them seem to hover in the air.\r\nThis alcove had a long, curving stone desk joined directly into the rim of the balcony. There was a single chair and a gobletlike crystal bowl. Shallan nodded in thanks to the servant, who withdrew, then she pulled out a handful of spheres and dropped them into the bowl, lighting the alcove.\r\nShe sighed, sitting down in the chair and laying her satchel on the desk. She undid the laces on her satchel, busying herself as she tried to think of something\u2014anything\u2014that would persuade Jasnah.\r\nFirst,she decided,\r\nI need to clear my mind.\r\nFrom her satchel she removed a sheaf of thick drawing paper, a set of charcoal pencils of different widths, some brushes and steel pens, ink, and watercolors. Finally, she took out her smaller notebook, bound in codex form, which contained the nature sketches she\u2019d done during her weeks aboard the\r\nWind\u2019s Pleasure.\r\nThese were simple things, really, but worth more to her than a chest full of spheres. She took a sheet off the stack, then selected a fine-pointed charcoal pencil, rolling it between her fingers. She closed her eyes and fixed an image in her mind: Kharbranth as she\u2019d memorized it in that moment soon after landing on the docks. Waves surging against the wooden posts, a salty scent to the air, men climbing rigging calling one another with excitement. And the city itself, rising up the hillside, homes stacked atop homes, not a speck of land wasted. Bells, distant, tinkling softly in the air.\r\nShe opened her eyes and began to draw. Her fingers moved on their own, sketching broad lines first. The cracklike valley the city was situated in. The port. Here, squares to be homes, there a slash to mark a switchback of the grand roadway that led up to the Conclave. Slowly, bit by bit, she added detail. Shadows as windows. Lines to fill out the roadways. Hints of people and carts to show the chaos of the thoroughfares.\r\nShe had read of how sculptors worked. Many would take a blank stone block and work it into a vague shape first. Then, they\u2019d work it over again, carving more detail with each pass. It was the same for her in drawing. Broad lines first, then some details, then more, then down to the finest of lines. She had no formal training in pencils; she simply did what felt right.\r\nThe city took shape beneath her fingers. She coaxed it free, line by line, scratch by scratch. What would she do without this? Tension bled from her body, as if released from her fingertips into the pencil.\r\nShe lost track of time as she worked. Sometimes she felt like she was entering a trance, everything else fading. Her fingers almost seemed to draw of their own accord. It was so much easier to think while drawing.\r\nBefore too long, she had copied her Memory onto the page. She held up the sheet, satisfied, relaxed, her mind clear. The memorized image of Kharbranth was gone from her head; she\u2019d released it into her sketch. There was a sense of relaxation to that too. As if her mind was put under tension holding Memories until they could be used.\r\nShe did Yalb next, standing shirtless in his vest and gesturing to the short porter who had pulled her up to the Conclave. She smiled as she worked, remembering Yalb\u2019s affable voice. He\u2019d likely returned to the\r\nWind\u2019s Pleasureby now. Had it been two hours? Probably.\r\nShe was always more excited by drawing animals and people than she was by drawing things. There was something energizing about putting a living creature onto the page. A city was lines and boxes, but a person was circles and curves. Could she get that smirk on Yalb\u2019s face right? Could she show his lazy contentedness, the way he would flirt with a woman far above his station? And the porter, with his thin fingers and sandaled feet, his long coat and baggy pants. His strange language, his keen eyes, his plan to increase his tip by offering not just a ride, but a tour.\r\nWhen she drew, she didn\u2019t feel as if she worked with only charcoal and paper. In drawing a portrait, her medium was the soul itself. There were plants from which one could remove a tiny cutting\u2014a leaf, or a bit of stem\u2014then plant it and grow a duplicate. When she collected a Memory of a person, she was snipping free a bud of their soul, and she cultivated and grew it on the page. Charcoal for sinew, paper pulp for bone, ink for blood, the paper\u2019s texture for skin. She fell into a rhythm, a cadence, the scratching of her pencil like the sound of breathing from those she depicted.\r\nCreationspren began to gather around her pad, looking at her work. Like other spren, they were said to always be around, but usually invisible. Sometimes you attracted them. Sometimes you didn\u2019t. With drawing, skill seemed to make a difference.\r\nCreationspren were of medium size, as tall as one of her fingers, and they glowed with a faint silvery light. They transformed perpetually, taking new shapes. Usually the shapes were things they had seen recently. An urn, a person, a table, a wheel, a nail. Always of the same silvery color, always the same diminutive height. They imitated shapes exactly, but moved them in strange ways. A table would roll like a wheel, an urn would shatter and repair itself.\r\nHer drawing gathered about a half-dozen of them, pulling them by her act of creation just as a bright fire would draw flamespren. She\u2019d learned to ignore them. They weren\u2019t substantial\u2014if she moved her arm through one, its figure would smear like scattered sand, then reform. She never felt a thing when touching one.\r\nEventually, she held up the page, satisfied. It depicted Yalb and the porter in detail, with hints of the busy city behind. She\u2019d gotten their eyes right. That was the most important. Each of the Ten Essences had an analogous part of the human body\u2014blood for liquid, hair for wood, and so forth. The eyes were associated with crystal and glass. The windows into a person\u2019s mind and spirit.\r\nShe set the page aside. Some men collected trophies. Others collected weapons or shields. Many collected spheres.\r\nShallan collected people. People, and interesting creatures. Perhaps it was because she\u2019d spent so much of her youth in a virtual prison. She\u2019d developed the habit of memorizing faces, then drawing them later, after her father had discovered her sketching the gardeners. His daughter? Drawing pictures of darkeyes? He\u2019d been furious with her\u2014one of the infrequent times he\u2019d directed his infamous temper at his daughter.\r\nAfter that, she\u2019d done drawings of people only when in private, instead using her open drawing times to sketch the insects, crustaceans, and plants of the manor gardens. Her father hadn\u2019t minded this\u2014zoology and botany were proper feminine pursuits\u2014and had encouraged her to choose natural history as her Calling.\r\nShe took out a third blank sheet. It seemed to beg her to fill it. A blank page was nothing but potential, pointless until it was used. Like a fully infused sphere cloistered inside a pouch, prevented from making its light useful.\r\nFill me.\r\nThe creationspren gathered around the page. They were still, as if curious, anticipatory. Shallan closed her eyes and imagined Jasnah Kholin, standing before the blocked door, the Soulcaster glowing on her hand. The hallway hushed, save for a child\u2019s sniffles. Attendants holding their breath. An anxious king. A still reverence.\r\nShallan opened her eyes and began to draw with vigor, intentionally losing herself. The less she was in the\r\nnowand the more she was in the\r\nthen, the better the sketch would be. The other two pictures had been warm-ups; this was the day\u2019s masterpiece. With the paper bound onto the board\u2014safehand holding that\u2014her freehand flew across the page, occasionally switching to other pencils. Soft charcoal for deep, thick blackness, like Jasnah\u2019s beautiful hair. Hard charcoal for light greys, like the powerful waves of light coming from the Soulcaster\u2019s gems.\r\nFor a few extended moments, Shallan was back in that hallway again, watching something that should not be: a heretic wielding one of the most sacred powers in all the world. The power of change itself, the power by which the Almighty had created Roshar. He had another name, allowed to pass only the lips of ardents.\r\nElithanathile. He Who Transforms.\r\nShallan could smell the musty hallway. She could hear the child whimpering. She could feel her own heart beating in anticipation. The boulder would soon change. Sucking away the Stormlight in Jasnah\u2019s gemstone, it would give up its essence, becoming something new. Shallan\u2019s breath caught in her throat.\r\nAnd then the memory faded, returning her to the quiet, dim alcove. The page now held a perfect rendition of the scene, worked in blacks and greys. The princess\u2019s proud figure regarded the fallen stone, demanding that it give way before her will. It\r\nwasher. Shallan knew, with the intuitive certainty of an artist, that this was one of the finest pieces she had ever done. In a very small way, she had captured Jasnah Kholin, something the devotaries had never managed. That gave her a euphoric thrill. Even if this woman rejected Shallan again, one fact would not change. Jasnah Kholin had joined Shallan\u2019s collection.\r\nShallan wiped her fingers on her cleaning cloth, then lifted the paper. She noted absently that she\u2019d attracted some two dozen creationspren now. She would have to lacquer the page with plytree sap to set the charcoal and protect it from smudges. She had some in her satchel. First she wanted to study the page and the figure it contained. Who\r\nwasJasnah Kholin? Not one to be cowed, certainly. She was a woman to the bone, master of the feminine arts, but not by any means delicate.\r\nSuch a woman would appreciate Shallan\u2019s determination. She\r\nwouldlisten to another request for wardship, assuming it was presented properly.\r\nJasnah was also a rationalist, a woman with the audacity to deny the existence of the Almighty himself based on her own reasoning. Jasnah would appreciate strength, but only if it was shaped by logic.\r\nShallan nodded to herself, taking out a fourth sheet of paper and a fine-tipped brushpen, then shaking and opening her jar of ink. Jasnah had demanded proof of Shallan\u2019s logical and writing skills. Well, what better way to do that than to supplicate the woman with words?\r\nBrightness Jasnah Kholin,Shallan wrote, painting the letters as neatly and beautifully as she could. She could have used a reed instead, but a brushpen was for works of art. She intended this page to be just that.\r\nYou have rejected my petition. I accept that. Yet, as anyone trained in formal inquiry knows, no supposition should be treated as axiomatic.The actual argument usually read \u201Cno supposition\u2014save for the existence of the Almighty himself\u2014should be held as axiomatic.\u201D But this wording would appeal to Jasnah.\r\nA scientist must be willing to change her theories if experiment disproves them. I hold to the hope that you treat decisions in a like manner: as preliminary results pending further information.\r\nFrom our brief interaction, I can see that you appreciate tenacity. You complimented me on continuing to seek you out. Therefore, I presume that you will not find this letter a breach of good taste. Take it as proof of my ardor to be your ward, and not as disdain for your expressed decision.\r\nShallan raised the end of her brushpen to her lips as she considered her next step. The creationspren slowly faded away, vanishing. There were said to be logicspren\u2014in the form of tiny stormclouds\u2014who were attracted to great arguments, but Shallan had never seen them.\r\nYou expect proof of my worthiness,Shallan continued.\r\nI wish I could demonstrate that my schooling is more complete than our interview revealed. Unfortunately, I haven\u2019t the grounds for such an argument. I have weaknesses in my understanding. That is plain and not subject to reasonable dispute.\r\nBut the lives of men and women are more than logical puzzles; the context of their experiences is invaluable in making good decisions. My study in logic does not rise to your standards, but even I know that the rationalists have a rule: One cannot apply logic as an absolute where human beings are concerned. We are not beings of thought only.\r\nTherefore, the soul of my argument here is to give perspective on my ignorance. Not by way of excuse, but of explanation. You expressed displeasure that one such as I should be trained so inadequately. What of my stepmother? What of my tutors? Why was my education handled so poorly?\r\nThe facts are embarrassing. I have had few tutors and virtually no education. My stepmother tried, but she had no education herself. It is a carefully guarded secret, but many of the rural Veden houses ignore the proper training of their women.\r\nI had three different tutors when I was very young, but each left after a few months, citing my father\u2019s temper or rudeness as her reason. I was left to my own devices in education. I have learned what I could through reading, filling in the gaps by taking advantage of my own curious nature. But I will not be capable of matching knowledge with someone who has been given the benefit of a formal\u2014and expensive\u2014education.\r\nWhy is this an argument that you should accept me? Because everything I have learned has come by way of great personal struggle. What others were handed, I had to hunt. I believe that because of this, my education\u2014limited though it is\u2014has extra worth and merit. I respect your decisions, but I do ask you to reconsider. Which would you rather have? A ward who is able to repeat the correct answers because an overpriced tutor drilled them into her, or a ward who had to struggle and fight for everything she has learned?\r\nI assure you that one of those two will prize your teachings far more than the other.\r\nShe raised her brush. Her arguments seemed imperfect now that she considered them. She exposed her ignorance, then expected Jasnah to welcome her? Still, it seemed the right thing to do, for all the fact that this letter was a lie. A lie built of truths. She hadn\u2019t truly come to partake of Jasnah\u2019s knowledge. She had come as a thief.\r\nThat made her conscience itch, and she nearly reached out and crumpled the page. Steps in the hallway outside made her freeze. She leaped to her feet, spinning, safehand held to her breast. She fumbled for words to explain her presence to Jasnah Kholin.\r\nLight and shadows flickered in the hallway, then a figure hesitantly looked into the alcove, a single white sphere cupped in one hand for light. It was\r\nnotJasnah. It was a man in his early twenties wearing simple grey robes. An ardent. Shallan relaxed.\r\nThe young man noticed her. His face was narrow, his blue eyes keen. His beard was trimmed short and square, his head shaved. When he spoke, his voice had a cultured tone. \u201CAh, excuse me, Brightness. I thought this was the alcove of Jasnah Kholin.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt is,\u201D Shallan said.\r\n\u201COh. You\u2019re waiting for her too?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes.\u201D\r\n\u201CWould you mind terribly if I waited with you?\u201D He had a faint Herdazian accent.\r\n\u201COf course not, Ardent.\u201D She nodded her head in respect, then gathered up her things in haste, preparing the seat for him.\r\n\u201CI can\u2019t take your seat, Brightness! I\u2019ll fetch another for myself.\u201D\r\nShe raised a hand in protest, but he had already retreated. He returned a few moments later, carrying a chair from another alcove. He was tall and lean, and\u2014she decided with slight discomfort\u2014rather handsome. Her father had owned only three ardents, all elderly men. They had traveled his lands and visited the villages, ministering to the people, helping them reach Points in their Glories and Callings. She had their faces in her collection of portraits.\r\nThe ardent set down his chair. He hesitated before sitting, glancing at the table. \u201CMy, my,\u201D he said in surprise.\r\nFor a moment, Shallan thought he was reading her letter, and she felt an irrational surge of panic. The ardent, however, was regarding the three drawings that lay at the head of the table, awaiting lacquer.\r\n\u201CYou did these, Brightness?\u201D he said.\r\n\u201CYes, Ardent,\u201D Shallan said, lowering her eyes.\r\n\u201CNo need to be so formal!\u201D the ardent said, leaning down and adjusting his spectacles as he studied her work. \u201CPlease, I am Brother Kabsal, or just Kabsal. Really, it\u2019s fine. And you are?\u201D\r\n\u201CShallan Davar.\u201D\r\n\u201CBy Vedeledev\u2019s golden keys, Brightness!\u201D Brother Kabsal said, seating himself. \u201CDid Jasnah Kholin teach you this skill with the pencil?\u201D\r\n\u201CNo, Ardent,\u201D she said, still standing.\r\n\u201CStill so formal,\u201D he said, smiling at her. \u201CTell me, am I so intimidating as that?\u201D\r\n\u201CI have been brought up to show respect to ardents.\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, I myself find that respect is like manure. Use it where needed, and growth will flourish. Spread it on too thick, and things just start to smell.\u201D His eyes twinkled.\r\nHad an\r\nardent\u2014a servant of the Almighty\u2014just spoken of\r\nmanure? \u201CAn ardent is a representative of the Almighty himself,\u201D she said. \u201CTo show you lack of respect would be to show it to the Almighty.\u201D\r\n\u201CI see. And this is how you\u2019d respond if the Almighty himself appeared to you here? All of this formality and bowing?\u201D\r\nShe hesitated. \u201CWell, no.\u201D\r\n\u201CAh, and how\r\nwouldyou react?\u201D\r\n\u201CI suspect with screams of pain,\u201D she said, letting her thought slip out too easily. \u201CAs it is written that the Almighty\u2019s glory is such that any who look upon him would immediately be burned to ash.\u201D\r\nThe ardent laughed at that. \u201CWisely spoken indeed. Please, do sit, though.\u201D\r\nShe did so, hesitant.\r\n\u201CYou still appear conflicted,\u201D he said, holding up her portrait of Jasnah. \u201CWhat must I do to put you at ease? Shall I step up onto this desk here and do a jig?\u201D\r\nShe blinked in surprise.\r\n\u201CNo objection?\u201D Brother Kabsal said. \u201CWell, then\u2026\u201D He set down the portrait and began to climb up on his chair.\r\n\u201CNo, please!\u201D Shallan said, holding out her freehand.\r\n\u201CAre you certain?\u201D he glanced at the desk appraisingly.\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D Shallan said, imagining the ardent teetering and making a misstep, then falling off the balcony and plunging dozens of feet to the ground below. \u201CPlease, I promise not to respect you any longer!\u201D\r\nHe chuckled, hopping down and seating himself. He leaned closer to her, as if conspiratorially. \u201CThe table jig threat almost always works. I\u2019ve only ever had to go through with it once, due to a lost bet against Brother Lhanin. The master ardent of our monastery nearly keeled over in shock.\u201D\r\nShallan found herself smiling. \u201CYou\u2019re an ardent; you\u2019re forbidden to have possessions. What did you bet?\u201D\r\n\u201CTwo deep breaths of a winter rose\u2019s fragrance,\u201D said Brother Kabsal, \u201Cand the sunlight\u2019s warmth on your skin.\u201D He smiled. \u201CWe can be rather creative at times. Years spent marinating in a monastery can do that to a man. Now, you were about to explain to me where you learned such skill with a pencil.\u201D\r\n\u201CPractice,\u201D Shallan said. \u201CI should suspect that is how everyone learns, eventually.\u201D\r\n\u201CWise words again. I am beginning to wonder which of us it the ardent. But surely you had a master to teach you.\u201D\r\n\u201CDandos the Oilsworn.\u201D\r\n\u201CAh, a true master of pencils if there ever was one. Now, not that I doubt your word, Brightness, but I\u2019m rather intrigued how Dandos Heraldin could have trained you in arts, as\u2014last I checked\u2014he\u2019s suffering a rather terminal and perpetual ailment. Namely, that of being\r\ndead. For three hundred years.\u201D\r\nShallan blushed. \u201CMy father had a book of his instruction.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou learned this,\u201D Kabsal said, lifting up her drawing of Jasnah, \u201Cfrom a\r\nbook.\u201D\r\n\u201CEr\u2026yes?\u201D\r\nHe looked back at the picture. \u201CI need to read more.\u201D\r\nShallan found herself laughing at the ardent\u2019s expression, and she took a Memory of him sitting there, admiration and perplexity blending on his face as he studied the picture, rubbing his bearded chin with one finger.\r\nHe smiled pleasantly, setting down the picture. \u201CYou have lacquer?\u201D\r\n\u201CI do,\u201D she said, getting it out of her satchel. It was contained in a bulb sprayer of the type often used for perfume.\r\nHe accepted the small jar and twisted the clasp on the front, then gave the bottle a shake and tested the lacquer on the back of his hand. He nodded in satisfaction and reached for the drawing. \u201CA piece such as this should not be allowed to risk smudging.\u201D\r\n\u201CI can lacquer it,\u201D Shallan said. \u201CNo need to trouble yourself.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt is no trouble; it\u2019s an honor. Besides, I am an ardent. We don\u2019t know what to do with ourselves when we aren\u2019t busying about, doing things others could do for themselves. It is best just to humor me.\u201D He began to apply the lacquer, dusting the page with careful puffs.\r\nShe had trouble keeping herself from reaching to snatch the sketch away. Fortunately, his hands were careful, and the lacquer went on evenly. He\u2019d obviously done this before.\r\n\u201CYou are from Jah Keved, I presume?\u201D he asked.\r\n\u201CFrom the hair?\u201D she asked, raising a hand to her red locks. \u201COr from the accent?\u201D\r\n\u201CFrom the way you treat ardents. The Veden Church is by far the most traditional. I have visited your lovely country on two occasions; while your food sits well in my stomach, the amount of bowing and scraping you show ardents made me uncomfortable.\u201D\r\n\u201CPerhaps you should have danced on a few tables.\u201D\r\n\u201CI considered it,\u201D he said, \u201Cbut my brother and sister ardents from your country would likely have dropped dead of embarrassment. I would hate to have that on my conscience. The Almighty is not kind toward those who kill his priests.\u201D\r\n\u201CI should think that killing in general would be frowned upon,\u201D she responded, still watching him apply the lacquer. It felt odd to let someone else work on her art.\r\n\u201CWhat does Brightness Jasnah think of your skill?\u201D he asked as he worked.\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t think she cares,\u201D Shallan said, grimacing and remembering her conversation with the woman. \u201CShe doesn\u2019t seem terribly appreciative of the visual arts.\u201D\r\n\u201CSo I have heard. It\u2019s one of her few faults, unfortunately.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnother being that little matter of her heresy?\u201D\r\n\u201CIndeed,\u201D Kabsal said, smiling. \u201CI must admit, I stepped in here expecting indifference, not deference. How did you come to be part of her entourage?\u201D\r\nShallan started, realizing for the first time that Brother Kabsal must have assumed her to be one of the Brightlady Kholin\u2019s attendants. Perhaps a ward.\r\n\u201CBother,\u201D she said to herself.\r\n\u201CHum?\u201D\r\n\u201CIt appears I\u2019ve inadvertently misled you, Brother Kabsal. I\u2019m not associated with Brightness Jasnah. Not yet, anyway. I\u2019ve been trying to get her to take me on as a ward.\u201D\r\n\u201CAh,\u201D he said, finishing his lacquering.\r\n\u201CI\u2019m sorry.\u201D\r\n\u201CFor what? You did nothing wrong.\u201D He blew on the picture, then turned it for her to see. It was perfectly lacquered, without any smears. \u201CIf you would do me a favor, child?\u201D he said, setting the page aside.\r\n\u201CAnything.\u201D\r\nHe raised an eyebrow at that.\r\n\u201CAnything reasonable,\u201D she corrected.\r\n\u201CBy whose reason?\u201D\r\n\u201CMine, I guess.\u201D\r\n\u201CPity,\u201D he said, standing. \u201CThen I will limit myself. If you would kindly let Brightness Jasnah know that I called upon her?\u201D\r\n\u201CShe knows you?\u201D What business had a Herdazian ardent with Jasnah, a confirmed atheist?\r\n\u201COh, I wouldn\u2019t say that,\u201D he replied. \u201CI\u2019d hope she\u2019s heard my name, though, since I\u2019ve requested an audience with her several times.\u201D\r\nShallan nodded, rising. \u201CYou want to try to convert her, I presume?\u201D\r\n\u201CShe presents a unique challenge. I don\u2019t think I could live with myself if I didn\u2019t at least\r\ntryto persuade her.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd we wouldn\u2019t want you to be unable to live with yourself,\u201D Shallan noted, \u201Cas the alternative harks back to your nasty habit of almost killing ardents.\u201D\r\n\u201CExactly. Anyway, I think a personal message from you might help where written requests have been ignored.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2026doubt that.\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, if she refuses, it only means that I\u2019ll be back.\u201D He smiled. \u201CThat would mean\u2014hopefully\u2014that we shall meet each other again. So I look forward to it.\u201D\r\n\u201CI as well. And I\u2019m sorry again about the misunderstanding.\u201D\r\n\u201CBrightness! Please. Don\u2019t take responsibility for\r\nmyassumptions.\u201D\r\nShe smiled. \u201CI should hesitate to take responsibility for you in\r\nanymanner or regard, Brother Kabsal. But I still feel bad.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt will pass,\u201D he noted, blue eyes twinkling. \u201CBut I\u2019ll do my best to make you feel well again. Is there anything you\u2019re fond of? Other than respecting ardents and drawing amazing pictures, that is?\u201D\r\n\u201CJam.\u201D\r\nHe cocked his head.\r\n\u201CI like it,\u201D she said, shrugging. \u201CYou asked what I was fond of. Jam.\u201D\r\n\u201CSo it shall be.\u201D He withdrew into the dark corridor, fishing in his robe pocket for his sphere to give him light. In moments, he was gone.\r\nWhy didn\u2019t he wait for Jasnah to return himself? Shallan shook her head, then lacquered her other two pictures. She had just finished letting them dry\u2014packing them in her satchel\u2014when she heard footsteps in the hallway again and recognized Jasnah\u2019s voice speaking.\r\nShallan hurriedly gathered her things, leaving the letter on the desk, then stepped up to the side of the alcove to wait. Jasnah Kholin entered a moment later, accompanied by a small group of servants.\r\nShe did not look pleased."

      "ChapterName": "8: NEARER THE FLAME",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\n\u201CVictory! We stand atop the mount! We scatter them before us! Their homes become our dens, their lands are now our farms! And they shall burn, as we once did, in a place that is hollow and forlorn.\u201D\r\n\u2014Collected on Ishashan, 1172, 18 seconds pre-death. Subject was a lighteyed spinster of the eighth dahn.\r\nShallan\u2019s fears were confirmed as Jasnah looked straight at her, then lowered her safehand to her side in a mark of frustration. \u201CSo you\r\narehere.\u201D\r\nShallan cringed. \u201CThe servants told you, then?\u201D\r\n\u201CYou didn\u2019t think that they would leave someone in my alcove and not warn me?\u201D Behind Jasnah, a small group of parshmen hesitated in the hallway, each carrying an armload of books.\r\n\u201CBrightness Kholin,\u201D Shallan said. \u201CI just\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CI have wasted enough time on you already,\u201D Jasnah said, eyes furious. \u201CYou will withdraw, Miss Davar. And I will not see you again during my time here. Am I\r\nunderstood?\u201D\r\nShallan\u2019s hopes crumbled. She shrank back. There was a gravity to Jasnah Kholin. One did not disobey her. One need only look into those eyes to understand.\r\n\u201CI\u2019m sorry to have bothered you,\u201D Shallan whispered, clutching her satchel and leaving with as much dignity as she could manage. She barely kept the tears of embarrassment and disappointment from her eyes as she hastened down the hallway, feeling like a complete fool.\r\nShe reached the porter\u2019s shaft, though they had already returned below after bringing up Jasnah. Shallan didn\u2019t pull the bell to summon them. Instead she placed her back to the wall and sank down to the floor, knees up against her chest, satchel in her lap. She wrapped her arms around her legs, freehand clasping her safehand through the fabric of her cuff, breathing quietly.\r\nAngry people unsettled her. She couldn\u2019t help but think of her father in one of his tirades, couldn\u2019t help but hear screams, bellows, and whimpers. Was she weak because confrontation unsettled her so? She felt that she was.\r\nFoolish, idiot girl,she thought, a few painspren crawling out of the wall near her head.\r\nWhat made you think you could do this? You\u2019ve only set foot off your family grounds a half-dozen times during your life. Idiot, idiot,idiot!\r\nShe had persuaded her brothers to trust her, to put hope in her ridiculous plan. And now what had she done? Wasted six months during which their enemies circled closer.\r\n\u201CBrightness Davar?\u201D asked a hesitant voice.\r\nShallan looked up, realizing she\u2019d been so wrapped in her misery that she hadn\u2019t seen the servant approach. He was a younger man, wearing an all black uniform, no emblem on the breast. Not a master-servant, but perhaps one in training.\r\n\u201CBrightness Kholin would like to speak with you.\u201D The young man gestured back down the hallway.\r\nTo berate me further?Shallan thought with a grimace. But a highlady like Jasnah got what she wanted. Shallan forced herself to stop shaking, then stood. At least she\u2019d been able to keep the tears away; she hadn\u2019t ruined her makeup. She followed the servant back to the lit alcove, satchel clutched before her like a shield on the battlefield.\r\nJasnah Kholin sat in the chair Shallan had been using, stacks of books on the table. Jasnah was rubbing her forehead with her freehand. The Soulcaster rested against the back of her skin, the smokestone dark and cracked. Though Jasnah looked fatigued, she sat with perfect posture, her fine silk dress covering her feet, her safehand held across her lap.\r\nJasnah focused on Shallan, lowering her freehand. \u201CI should not have treated you with such anger, Miss Davar,\u201D she said in a tired voice. \u201CYou were simply showing persistence, a trait I normally encourage. Storms alight, I\u2019ve oft been guilty of stubbornness myself. Sometimes we find it hardest to accept in others that which we cling to in ourselves. My only excuse can be that I have put myself under an unusual amount of strain lately.\u201D\r\nShallan nodded in gratitude, though she felt terribly awkward.\r\nJasnah turned to look out of the balcony into the dark space of the Veil. \u201CI know what people say of me. I should hope that I am not as harsh as some say, though a woman could have far worse than a reputation for sternness. It can serve one well.\u201D\r\nShallan had to forcibly keep herself from fidgeting. Should she withdraw?\r\nJasnah shook her head to herself, though Shallan could not guess what thoughts had caused the unconscious gesture. Finally, she turned back to Shallan and waved toward the large, gobletlike bowl on the desk. It held a dozen of Shallan\u2019s spheres.\r\nShallan raised her freehand to her lips in shock. She\u2019d completely forgotten the money. She bowed to Jasnah in thanks, then hurriedly collected the spheres. \u201CBrightness, lest I forget, I should mention that an ardent\u2014Brother Kabsal\u2014came to see you while I waited here. He wished me to pass on his desire to speak with you.\u201D\r\n\u201CNot surprising,\u201D Jasnah said. \u201CYou seem surprised about the spheres, Miss Davar. I assumed that you were waiting outside to recover them. Is that not why you were so close?\u201D\r\n\u201CNo, Brightness. I was just settling my nerves.\u201D\r\n\u201CAh.\u201D\r\nShallan bit her lip. The princess appeared to have gotten past her initial tirade. Perhaps\u2026\u201CBrightness,\u201D Shallan said, cringing at her brashness, \u201Cwhat did you think of my letter?\u201D\r\n\u201CLetter?\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2026\u201D Shallan glanced at the desk. \u201CBeneath that stack of books, Brightness.\u201D\r\nA servant quickly moved aside the stack of books; the parshman must have set it on the paper without noticing. Jasnah picked up the letter, raising an eyebrow, and Shallan hurriedly undid her satchel and placed the spheres in her money pouch. Then she cursed herself for being so quick, as now she had nothing to do but stand and wait for Jasnah to finish reading.\r\n\u201CThis is true?\u201D Jasnah looking up from the paper. \u201CYou are self-trained?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes, Brightness.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat is remarkable.\u201D\r\n\u201CThank you, Brightness.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd this letter was a clever maneuver. You correctly assumed that I would respond to a written plea. This shows me your skill with words, and the rhetoric of the letter gives proof that you can think logically and make a good argument.\u201D\r\n\u201CThank you, Brightness,\u201D Shallan said, feeling another surge of hope, mixed with fatigue. Her emotions had been jerked back and forth like a rope being used for a tugging contest.\r\n\u201CYou should have left the note for me, and withdrawn before I returned.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut then the note would have been lost beneath that stack of books.\u201D\r\nJasnah raised an eyebrow at her, as if to show that she did not appreciate being corrected. \u201CVery well. The context of a person\u2019s life\r\nisimportant. Your circumstances do not excuse your lack of education in history and philosophy, but leniency is in order. I will allow you to petition me again at a later date, a privilege I have never given any aspiring ward. Once you have a sufficient groundwork in those two subjects, come to me again. If you have improved suitably, I will accept you.\u201D\r\nShallan\u2019s emotions sank. Jasnah\u2019s offer\r\nwaskindly, but it would take years of study to accomplish what she asked. House Davar would have fallen by then, her family\u2019s lands divided among its creditors, her brothers and herself stripped of title and perhaps enslaved.\r\n\u201CThank you, Brightness,\u201D Shallan said, bowing her head.\r\nJasnah nodded, as if considering the matter closed. Shallan withdrew, walking quietly down the hallway and pulling the cord to ring for the porters.\r\nJasnah had all but promised to accept her at a later date. For most, that would be a great victory. Being trained by Jasnah Kholin\u2014thought by some to be the finest living scholar\u2014would have ensured a bright future. Shallan would have married extremely well, likely to the son of a highprince, and would have found new social circles open to her. Indeed, if Shallan had possessed the time to train under Jasnah, the sheer prestige of a Kholin affiliation might have been enough to save her house.\r\nIf only.\r\nEventually, Shallan made her way out of the Conclave; there were no gates on the front, just pillars set before the open maw. She was surprised to discover how dim it was outside. She trailed down the large steps, then took a smaller, more cultivated side path where she would be out of the way. Small shelves of ornamental shalebark had been grown along this walkway, and several species had let out fanlike tendrils to wave in the evening breeze. A few lazy lifespren\u2014like specks of glowing green dust\u2014flitted from one frond to the next.\r\nShallan leaned back against the stonelike plant, the tendrils pulling in and hiding. From this vantage, she could look down at Kharbranth, lights glowing beneath her like a cascade of fire streaming down the cliff face. The only other option for her and her brothers was to run. To abandon the family estates in Jah Keved and seek asylum. But where? Were there old allies her father\r\nhadn\u2019talienated?\r\nThere was that matter of the strange collection of maps they\u2019d found in his study. What did they mean? He\u2019d rarely spoken of his plans to his children. Even her father\u2019s advisors knew very little. Helaran\u2014her eldest brother\u2014had known more, but he had vanished over a year ago, and her father had proclaimed him dead.\r\nAs always, thinking of her father made her feel ill, and the pain started to constrict her chest. She raised her freehand to her head, suddenly overwhelmed by the weight of House Davar\u2019s situation, her part in it, and the secret she now carried, hidden ten heartbeats away.\r\n\u201CHo, young miss!\u201D a voice called. She turned, shocked to see Yalb standing up on a rocky shelf a short distance from the Conclave entrance. A group of men in guard uniforms sat on the rock around him.\r\n\u201CYalb?\u201D she said, aghast. He should have returned to his ship hours ago. She hurried over to stand below the short stone outcropping. \u201CWhy are you still here?\u201D\r\n\u201COh,\u201D he said, grinning, \u201CI found myself a game of kabers here with these fine, upstanding gentlemen of the city guard. Figured officers of the law were right unlikely to cheat me, so we entered into a friendly-type game while I waited.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut you didn\u2019t\r\nneedto wait.\u201D\r\n\u201CDidn\u2019t need to win eighty chips off these fellows neither,\u201D Yalb said with a laugh. \u201CBut I did both!\u201D\r\nThe men sitting around him looked far less enthusiastic. Their uniforms were orange tabards tied about the middle with white sashes.\r\n\u201CWell, I suppose I should be leading you back to the ship, then,\u201D Yalb said, reluctantly gathering up the spheres in the pile at his feet. They glowed with a variety of hues. Their light was small\u2014each was only a chip\u2014but it was impressive winnings.\r\nShallan stepped back as Yalb hopped off the rock shelf. His companions protested his departure, but he gestured to Shallan. \u201CYou\u2019d have me leave a lighteyed woman of her stature to walk back to the ship on her own? I figured you for men of honor!\u201D\r\nThat quieted their protests.\r\nYalb chuckled to himself, bowing to Shallan and leading her away down the path. He had a twinkle to his eyes. \u201CStormfather, but it\u2019s fun to win against lawmen. I\u2019ll have free drinks at the docks once this gets around.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou shouldn\u2019t gamble,\u201D Shallan said. \u201CYou shouldn\u2019t try to guess the future. I didn\u2019t give you that sphere so you could waste it on such practices.\u201D\r\nYalb laughed. \u201CIt ain\u2019t gambling if you know you\u2019re going to win, young miss.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou\r\ncheated?\u201D she hissed, horrified. She glanced back at the guardsmen, who had settled down to continue their game, lit by the spheres on the stones before them.\r\n\u201CNot so loud!\u201D Yalb said in a low voice. However, he seemed very pleased with himself. \u201CCheating four guardsmen, now that\u2019s a trick. Hardly believe I managed it!\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m disappointed in you. This is\r\nnotproper behavior.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt is if you\u2019re a sailor, young miss.\u201D He shrugged. \u201CIt\u2019s what they right expected from me. Watched me like handlers of poisonous skyeels, they did. The game wasn\u2019t about the cards\u2014it was about them trying to figure how I was cheating and me trying to figure how to keep them from hauling me off. I think I might not have managed to walk away with my skin if you hadn\u2019t arrived!\u201D That didn\u2019t seem to worry him much.\r\nThe roadway down to the docks was not nearly as busy as it had been earlier, but there were still a surprisingly large number of people about. The street was lit by oil lanterns\u2014spheres would just have ended up in someone\u2019s pouch\u2014but many of the people about carried sphere lanterns, casting a rainbow of colored light on the roadway. The people were almost like spren, each a different hue, moving this way or that.\r\n\u201CSo, young miss,\u201D Yalb said, leading her carefully through the traffic. \u201CYou really want to go back? I just said what I did so I could extract myself from that game there.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes, I do want to go back, please.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd your princess?\u201D\r\nShallan grimaced. \u201CThe meeting was\u2026unproductive.\u201D\r\n\u201CShe didn\u2019t take you? What\u2019s wrong with her?\u201D\r\n\u201CChronic competence, I should guess. She\u2019s been so successful in life that she has unrealistic expectations of others.\u201D\r\nYalb frowned, guiding Shallan around a group of revelers stumbling drunkenly up the roadway. Wasn\u2019t it a little early for that sort of thing? Yalb got a few steps ahead, turning and walking backward, looking at her. \u201CThat doesn\u2019t make sense, young miss. What more could she want than you?\u201D\r\n\u201CMuch more, apparently.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut you\u2019re perfect! Pardon my forwardness.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou\u2019re walking backward.\u201D\r\n\u201CPardon my backwardness, then. You look good from any side, young miss, that you do.\u201D\r\nShe found herself smiling. Tozbek\u2019s sailors had far too high an opinion of her.\r\n\u201CYou\u2019d make an ideal ward,\u201D he continued. \u201CGenteel, pretty, refined and such. Don\u2019t much like your opinion on gambling, but that\u2019s to be expected. Wouldn\u2019t be right for a proper woman not to scold a fellow for gambling. It\u2019d be like the sun refusing to rise or the sea turning white.\u201D\r\n\u201COr Jasnah Kholin smiling.\u201D\r\n\u201CExactly! Anyway, you\u2019re perfect.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s kind of you to say so.\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, it\u2019s true,\u201D he said, putting hands on hips, stopping. \u201CSo that\u2019s it? You\u2019re going to give up?\u201D\r\nShe gave him a perplexed stare. He stood there on the busy roadway, lit from above by a lantern burning yellow-orange, hands on his hips, white Thaylen eyebrows drooping along the sides of his face, bare-chested under his open vest. That was a posture no citizen, no matter how high ranked, had ever taken at her father\u2019s mansion.\r\n\u201CI\r\ndidtry to persuade her,\u201D Shallan said, blushing. \u201CI went to her a second time, and she rejected me again.\u201D\r\n\u201CTwo times, eh? In cards, you always got to try a third hand. It wins the most often.\u201D\r\nShallan frowned. \u201CBut that\u2019s not really true. The laws of probability and statistics\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t know much blustering math,\u201D Yalb said, folding his arms. \u201CBut I do know the Passions. You win when you need it most, you see.\u201D\r\nThe Passions. Pagan superstition. Of course, Jasnah had referred to glyphwards as superstition too, so perhaps it all came down to perspective.\r\nTry a third time\u2026Shallan shivered to consider Jasnah\u2019s wrath if Shallan bothered her yet again. She\u2019d surely withdraw the offer to come study with her in the future.\r\nBut Shallan would never get to take that offer. It was like a glass sphere with no gemstone at the center. Pretty, but worthless. Was it not better to take one last chance at getting the position she needed\r\nnow?\r\nIt wouldn\u2019t work. Jasnah had made it quite clear that Shallan was not yet educated enough.\r\nNot yet educated enough\u2026\r\nAn idea sparked in Shallan\u2019s head. She raised her safehand to her breast, standing on that roadway, considering the audacity of it. She\u2019d likely get herself thrown from the city at Jasnah\u2019s demand.\r\nYet if she returned home without trying every avenue, could she face her brothers? They depended on her. For once in her life, someone\r\nneededShallan. That responsibility excited her. And terrified her.\r\n\u201CI need a book merchant,\u201D she found herself saying, voice wavering slightly.\r\nYalb raised an eyebrow at her.\r\n\u201CThird hand wins the most. Do you think you can find me a book merchant who is open at this hour?\u201D\r\n\u201CKharbranth is a major port, young miss,\u201D he said with a laugh. \u201CStores stay open late. Just wait here.\u201D He dashed off into the evening crowd, leaving her with an anxious protest on her lips.\r\nShe sighed, then seated herself in a demure posture on the stone base of a lantern pole. It should be safe. She saw other lighteyed women passing on the street, though they were often carried in palanquins or those small, hand-pulled vehicles. She even saw the occasional real carriage, though only the very wealthy could afford to keep horses.\r\nA few minutes later, Yalb popped out of the crowd as if from nowhere and waved for her to follow. She rose and hurried to him.\r\n\u201CShould we get a porter?\u201D she asked as he led her to a large side street that ran laterally across the city\u2019s hill. She stepped carefully; her skirt was long enough that she worried about tearing the hem on the stone. The strip at the bottom was designed to be easily replaced, but Shallan could hardly afford to waste spheres on such things.\r\n\u201CNah,\u201D Yalb said. \u201CIt\u2019s right here.\u201D He pointed along another cross street. This one had a row of shops climbing up the steep slope, each with a sign hanging out front bearing the glyphpair for\r\nbook, and those glyphs were often styled into the shape of a book. Illiterate servants who might be sent to a shop had to be able to recognize them.\r\n\u201CMerchants of the same type like to clump together,\u201D Yalb said, rubbing his chin. \u201CSeems dumb to me, but I guess merchants are like fish. Where you find one, you\u2019ll find others.\u201D\r\n\u201CThe same could be said of ideas,\u201D Shallan said, counting. Six different shops. All were lit with Stormlight in the windows, cool and even.\r\n\u201CThird one on the left,\u201D Yalb said, pointing. \u201CMerchant\u2019s name is Artmyrn. My sources say he\u2019s the best.\u201D It was a Thaylen name. Likely Yalb had asked others from his homeland, and they had pointed him here.\r\nShe nodded to Yalb and they climbed up the steep stone street to the shop. Yalb didn\u2019t enter with her; she\u2019d noticed that many men were uncomfortable around books and reading, even those who weren\u2019t Vorin.\r\nShe pushed through the door\u2014stout wood set with two crystal panels\u2014and stepped into a warm room, uncertain what to expect. She\u2019d never gone into a store to purchase anything; she\u2019d either sent servants, or the merchants had come to her.\r\nThe room inside looked very inviting, with large, comfortable easy chairs beside a hearth. Flamespren danced on burning logs there, and the floor was wood. Seamless wood; it had probably been Soulcast that way directly from the stone beneath. Lavish indeed.\r\nA woman stood behind a counter at the back of the room. She wore an embroidered skirt and blouse, rather than the sleek, silk, one-piece havah that Shallan wore. She was darkeyed, but she was obviously affluent. In Vorin kingdoms, she\u2019d likely be of the first or second nahn. Thaylens had their own system of ranks. At least they weren\u2019t completely pagan\u2014they respected eye color, and the woman wore a glove on her safehand.\r\nThere weren\u2019t many books in the place. A few on the counter, one on a stand beside the chairs. A clock ticked on the wall, its underside hung with a dozen shimmering silver bells. This looked more like a person\u2019s home than a shop.\r\nThe woman slid a marker into her book, smiling at Shallan. It was a smooth, eager smile. Almost predatory. \u201CPlease, Brightness, sit,\u201D she said, waving toward the chairs. The woman had curled her long, white Thaylen eyebrows so they hung down the sides of her face like locks from her bangs.\r\nShallan sat hesitantly as the woman rang a bell on the underside of the counter. Soon, a portly man waddled into the room wearing a vest that seemed ready to burst from the stress of holding in his girth. His hair was greying, and he kept his eyebrows combed back, over his ears.\r\n\u201CAh,\u201D he said, clapping ample hands, \u201Cdear young woman. Are you in the market for a nice novel? Some leisure reading to pass the cruel hours while you are separated from a lost love? Or perhaps a book on geography, with details of exotic locations?\u201D He had a slightly condescending tone and spoke in her native Veden.\r\n\u201CI\u2014No, thank you. I need an extensive set of books on history and three on philosophy.\u201D She thought back, trying to recall the names Jasnah had used. \u201CSomething by Placini, Gabrathin, Yustara, Manaline, or Shauka-daughter-Hasweth.\u201D\r\n\u201CHeavy reading for one so young,\u201D the man said, nodding to the woman, who was probably his wife. She ducked into the back room. He\u2019d use her for reading; even if he could read himself, he wouldn\u2019t want to offend customers by doing so in their presence. He would handle the money; commerce was a masculine art in most situations.\r\n\u201CNow, why is a young flower like yourself bothering herself with such topics?\u201D the merchant said, easing himself down into the chair across from her. \u201CCan\u2019t I interest you in a nice romantic novel? They are my specialty, you see. Young women from across the city come to me, and I always carry the best.\u201D\r\nHis tone set her on edge. It was galling enough to\r\nknowshe was a sheltered child. Was it really necessary to remind her of it? \u201CA romantic novel,\u201D she said, holding her satchel close to her chest. \u201CYes, perhaps that would be nice. Do you by chance have a copy of\r\nNearer the Flame?\u201D\r\nThe merchant blinked.\r\nNearer the Flamewas written from the viewpoint of a man who slowly descended into madness after watching his children starve.\r\n\u201CAre you certain you want something so, er, ambitious?\u201D the man asked.\r\n\u201CIs ambition such an unseemly attribute in a young woman?\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, no, I suppose not.\u201D He smiled again\u2014the thick, toothy smile of a merchant trying to put someone at ease. \u201CI can see you are a woman of discriminating taste.\u201D\r\n\u201CI am,\u201D Shallan said, voice firm though her heart fluttered. Was she destined to get into an argument with everyone she met? \u201CI\r\ndolike my meals prepared very carefully, as my palate is quite delicate.\u201D\r\n\u201CPardon. I meant that you have discriminating taste\r\nin books.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve never eaten one, actually.\u201D\r\n\u201CBrightness, I believe you are having sport with me.\u201D\r\n\u201CNot yet I\u2019m not. I haven\u2019t even really begun.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CNow,\u201D she said, \u201Cyou were right to compare the mind and the stomach.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CToo many of us,\u201D she said, \u201Ctake great pains with what we ingest through our mouths, and far less with what we partake of through our ears and eyes. Wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201D\r\nHe nodded, perhaps not trusting her to let him speak without interrupting. Shallan knew, somewhere in the back of her mind, that she was letting herself go too far\u2014that she was tense and frustrated after her interactions with Jasnah.\r\nShe didn\u2019t care at the moment. \u201CDiscriminating,\u201D she said, testing the world. \u201CI\u2019m not certain I agree with your choice of words. To discriminate is to maintain prejudice against. To be exclusive. Can a person afford to be exclusive with what they ingest? Whether we speak of food or of thoughts?\u201D\r\n\u201CI think they must be,\u201D the merchant said. \u201CIsn\u2019t that what you just said?\u201D\r\n\u201CI said we should take thought for what we read or eat. Not that we should be exclusive. Tell me, what do you think would happen to a person who ate only sweets?\u201D\r\n\u201CI know well,\u201D the man said. \u201CI have a sister-in-law who periodically upsets her stomach by doing that.\u201D\r\n\u201CSee, she was\r\ntoodiscriminating. The body needs many different foods to remain healthy. And the mind needs many different ideas to remain sharp. Wouldn\u2019t you agree? And so if I were to read only these silly romances you presume that my ambition can handle, my mind would grow sick as surely as your sister-in-law\u2019s stomach. Yes, I should think that the metaphor is a solid one. You are quite clever, Master Artmyrn.\u201D\r\nHis smile returned.\r\n\u201COf course,\u201D she noted, not smiling back, \u201Cbeing talked down to upsets both the mind\r\nandthe stomach. So nice of you to give a poignant object lesson to accompany your brilliant metaphor. Do you treat all of your customers this way?\u201D\r\n\u201CBrightness\u2026I believe you stray into sarcasm.\u201D\r\n\u201CFunny. I thought I\u2019d run straight into it, screaming at the top of my lungs.\u201D\r\nHe blushed and stood. \u201CI\u2019ll go help my wife.\u201D He hurriedly withdrew.\r\nShe sat back, and realized she was annoyed at herself for letting her frustration boil out. It was just what her nurses had warned her about. A young woman had to mind her words. Her father\u2019s intemperate tongue had earned their house a regrettable reputation; would she add to it?\r\nShe calmed herself, enjoying the warmth and watching the dancing flamespren until the merchant and his wife returned, bearing several stacks of books. The merchant took his seat again, and his wife pulled over a stool, setting the tomes on the floor and then showing them one at a time as her husband spoke.\r\n\u201CFor history, we have two choices,\u201D the merchant said, condescension\u2014and friendliness\u2014gone. \u201C\r\nTimes and Passage,by Rencalt, is a single volume survey of Rosharan history since the Hierocracy.\u201D His wife held up a red, cloth-bound volume. \u201CI told my wife that you would likely be insulted by such a shallow option, but she insisted.\u201D\r\n\u201CThank you,\u201D Shallan said. \u201CI am not insulted, but I do require something more detailed.\u201D\r\n\u201CThen perhaps\r\nEternathiswill serve you,\u201D he said as his wife held up a blue-grey set of four volumes. \u201CIt is a philosophical work which examines the same time period by focusing only on the interactions of the five Vorin kingdoms. As you can see, the treatment is exhaustive.\u201D\r\nThe four volumes were thick. The\r\nfiveVorin kingdoms? She\u2019d thought there were four. Jah Keved, Alethkar, Kharbranth, and Natanatan. United by religion, they had been strong allies during the years following the Recreance. What was the fifth kingdom?\r\nThe volumes intrigued her. \u201CI will take them.\u201D\r\n\u201CExcellent,\u201D the merchant said, a bit of the gleam returning to his eye. \u201COf the philosophical works you listed, we didn\u2019t have anything by Yustara. We have one each of works by Placini and Manaline; both are collections of excerpts from their most famous writings. I\u2019ve had the Placini book read to me; it\u2019s quite good.\u201D\r\nShallan nodded.\r\n\u201CAs for Gabrathin,\u201D he said, \u201Cwe have four different volumes. My, but he was a prolific one! Oh, and we have a single book by Shauka-daughter-Hasweth.\u201D The wife held up a thin green volume. \u201CI have to admit, I\u2019ve never had any of her work read to me. I didn\u2019t realize that there were any Shin philosophers of note.\u201D\r\nShallan looked at the four books by Gabrathin. She had no idea which one she should take, so she avoided the question, pointing at the two collections he had mentioned first and the single volume by Shauka-daughter-Hasweth. A philosopher from distant Shin, where people lived in mud and worshipped rocks? The man who had killed Jasnah\u2019s father nearly six years before\u2014prompting the war against the Parshendi in Natanatan\u2014had been Shin. The Assassin in White, they called him.\r\n\u201CI will take those three,\u201D Shallan said, \u201Calong with the histories.\u201D\r\n\u201CExcellent!\u201D the merchant repeated. \u201CFor buying so many, I will give you a fair discount. Let us say, ten emerald broams?\u201D\r\nShallan nearly choked. An emerald broam was the largest denomination of sphere, worth a thousand diamond chips. Ten of them was more than her trip to Kharbranth had cost by several magnitudes!\r\nShe opened her satchel, looking in at her money pouch. She had around eight emerald broams left. She\u2019d have to take fewer of the books, obviously, but which ones?\r\nSuddenly, the door slammed open. Shallan jumped and was surprised to see Yalb standing there, holding his cap in his hands, nervous. He rushed to her chair, going down on one knee. She was too stunned to say anything. Why was he so worried?\r\n\u201CBrightness,\u201D he said, bowing his head. \u201CMy master bids you return. He\u2019s reconsidered his offer. Truly, we can take the price you offered.\u201D\r\nShallan opened her mouth, but found herself stupefied.\r\nYalb glanced at the merchant. \u201CBrightness, don\u2019t buy from this man. He\u2019s a liar and a cheat. My master will sell you much finer books at a better price.\u201D\r\n\u201CNow, what\u2019s this?\u201D Artmyrn said, standing. \u201CHow dare you! Who is your master?\u201D\r\n\u201CBarmest,\u201D Yalb said defensively.\r\n\u201CThat rat. He sends a boy into\r\nmyshop trying to steal\r\nmycustomer? Outrageous!\u201D\r\n\u201CShe came to our shop first!\u201D Yalb said.\r\nShallan finally recovered her wits.\r\nStormfather! He\u2019s quite the actor.\u201CYou had your chance,\u201D she said to Yalb. \u201CRun along and tell your master that I refuse to be swindled. I will visit every bookshop in the city if that is what it takes to find someone reasonable.\u201D\r\n\u201CArtmyrn isn\u2019t reasonable,\u201D Yalb said, spitting to the side. The merchant\u2019s eyes opened wide with rage.\r\n\u201CWe shall see,\u201D Shallan said.\r\n\u201CBrightness,\u201D Artmyrn said, red faced. \u201CSurely you don\u2019t believe these allegations!\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd how much were you going to charge her?\u201D Yalb asked.\r\n\u201CTen emerald broams,\u201D Shallan said. \u201CFor those seven books.\u201D\r\nYalb laughed. \u201CAnd you didn\u2019t stand up and walk right out! You practically had my master\u2019s ears, and he offered you a better deal than that! Please, Brightness, return with me. We\u2019re ready to\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CTen was just an opening figure,\u201D Artmyrn said. \u201CI didn\u2019t expect her to take them.\u201D He looked at Shallan. \u201COf course,\r\neight\u2026.\u201D\r\nYalb laughed again. \u201CI\u2019m sure we have those same books, Brightness. I\u2019ll bet my master gives them to you for two.\u201D\r\nArtmyrn grew even more red-faced, muttering. \u201CBrightness, surely you wouldn\u2019t patronize someone so\r\ncrassas to send a servant into someone else\u2019s shop to steal his customers!\u201D\r\n\u201CPerhaps I would,\u201D Shallan said. \u201CAt least he didn\u2019t insult my intelligence.\u201D\r\nArtmyrn\u2019s wife glared at her husband, and the man grew even more red in the face. \u201CTwo emerald, three sapphire. That is as low as I can go. If you want cheaper than that, then buy from that scoundrel Barmest. The books will probably be missing pages, though.\u201D\r\nShallan hesitated, glancing at Yalb; he was caught up in his role, bowing and scraping. She caught his eyes, and he just kind of gave a shrug.\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll do it,\u201D she said to Artmyrn, prompting a groan from Yalb. He slunk away with a curse from Artmyrn\u2019s wife. Shallan rose and counted out the spheres; the emerald broams she retrieved from her safepouch.\r\nSoon, she walked from the shop bearing a heavy canvas bag. She walked down the steep street, and found Yalb lounging beside a lamppost. She smiled as he took the bag from her. \u201CHow did you know what a fair price for a book was?\u201D she asked.\r\n\u201CFair price?\u201D he said, slinging the bag over his shoulder. \u201CFor a book? I\u2019ve no idea. I just figured he\u2019d be trying to take you for as much as he could. That\u2019s why I asked around for who his biggest rival was and came back to help get him to be more reasonable.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt was that obvious I\u2019d let myself be swindled?\u201D she asked with a blush, the two of them walking out of the side street.\r\nYalb chuckled. \u201CJust a little. Anyway, conning men like him is almost as much fun as cheating guards. You probably could have gotten him down further by actually leaving with me, then coming back later to give him another chance.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat sounds complicated.\u201D\r\n\u201CMerchants is like mercenaries, my gammer always said. Only difference is that merchants will take your head off, then pretend to be your friend all the same.\u201D\r\nThis from a man who had just spent the evening cheating a group of guards at cards. \u201CWell, you have my thanks, anyway.\u201D\r\n\u201CWasn\u2019t nothing. It was fun, though I can\u2019t believe you paid what you did. It\u2019s just a bunch of wood. I could find some driftwood and put some funny marks on it. Would you pay me pure spheres for that too?\u201D\r\n\u201CI can\u2019t offer that,\u201D she said, fishing in her satchel. She took out the picture she\u2019d drawn of Yalb and the porter. \u201CBut please, take this, with my thanks.\u201D\r\nYalb took the picture and stepped up beneath a nearby lantern to get a look. He laughed, cocking his head, smiling broadly. \u201CStormfather! Ain\u2019t that something? Looks like I\u2019m seeing myself in a polished plate, it does. I can\u2019t take this, Brightness!\u201D\r\n\u201CPlease. I insist.\u201D She did, however, blink her eyes, taking a Memory of him standing there, one hand on his chin as he studied the picture of himself. She\u2019d redraw him later. After what he\u2019d done for her, she dearly wanted him in her collection.\r\nYalb carefully tucked the picture between the pages of a book, then hefted the bag and continued. They stepped back onto the main roadway. Nomon\u2014the middle moon\u2014had begun to rise, bathing the city in pale blue light. Staying up this late had been a rare privilege for her in her father\u2019s house, but these city people around them barely seemed to notice the late hour. What a strange place this city was.\r\n\u201CBack to the ship now?\u201D Yalb asked.\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D Shallan said, taking a deep breath. \u201CBack to the Conclave.\u201D\r\nHe raised an eyebrow, but led her back. Once there, she bid Yalb farewell, reminding him to take his picture. He did so, wishing her luck before hastening from the Conclave, probably worried about meeting the guardsmen he\u2019d cheated earlier.\r\nShallan had a servant carry her books, and made her way down the hallway back to the Veil. Just inside the ornate iron doors, she caught the attention of a master-servant.\r\n\u201CYes, Brightness?\u201D the man asked. Most of the alcoves were now dim, and patient servants were returning tomes to their safe place beyond the crystal walls.\r\nShaking off her fatigue, Shallan counted up the rows. There was still a light in Jasnah\u2019s alcove. \u201CI\u2019d like to use the alcove there,\u201D she said, pointing to the next balcony over.\r\n\u201CDo you have a chit of admittance?\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m afraid not.\u201D\r\n\u201CThen you\u2019ll have to rent the space if you wish to use it regularly. Two skymarks.\u201D\r\nWincing at the price, Shallan dug out the proper spheres and paid. Her money pouches were looking depressingly flat. She let the parshman porters haul her up to the appropriate level, then she quietly walked to her alcove. There, she used all her remaining spheres to fill the oversized goblet lamp. To get enough light, she was forced to use spheres of all nine colors and all three sizes, so the illumination was patchy and varied.\r\nShallan peeked over the side of her alcove, out at the next balcony over. Jasnah sat studying, heedless of the hour, her goblet filled to the brim with pure diamond broams. They were best for light, but less useful in Soulcasting, so weren\u2019t as valuable.\r\nShallan ducked back around. There was a place at the very edge of the alcove\u2019s table where she could sit, hidden by the wall from Jasnah, so she sat there. Perhaps she should have chosen an alcove on another level, but she wanted to keep an eye on the woman. Hopefully Jasnah would spend weeks here studying. Enough time for Shallan to dedicate herself to some fierce cramming. Her ability to memorize pictures and scenes didn\u2019t work as well on text, but she could learn lists and facts at a rate that her tutors had found remarkable.\r\nShe settled herself in the chair, pulling out the books and arranging them. She rubbed her eyes. It was really quite late, but there wasn\u2019t time to waste. Jasnah had said that Shallan could make another petition when the gaps in her knowledge were filled. Well, Shallan intended to fill those gaps in record time, then present herself again. She\u2019d do it when Jasnah was ready to leave Kharbranth.\r\nIt was a last, desperate hope, so frail that a strong gust of circumstance seemed likely to topple it. Taking a deep breath, Shallan opened the first of the history books.\r\n\u201CI\u2019m never going to be rid of you, am I?\u201D a soft, feminine voice asked.\r\nShallan jumped up, nearly knocking over her books as she spun toward the doorway. Jasnah Kholin stood there, deep blue dress embroidered in silver, its silken sheen reflecting the light of Shallan\u2019s spheres. The Soulcaster was covered by a fingerless black glove to block the bright gemstones.\r\n\u201CBrightness,\u201D Shallan said, rising and curtsying in an awkward rush. \u201CI didn\u2019t mean to disturb you. I\u2014\u201D\r\nJasnah quieted her with a wave of the hand. She stepped aside as a parshman entered Shallan\u2019s alcove, carrying a chair. He placed it beside Shallan\u2019s desk, and Jasnah glided over and sat.\r\nShallan tried to judge Jasnah\u2019s mood, but the older woman\u2019s emotions were impossible to read. \u201CI honestly didn\u2019t want to disturb you.\u201D\r\n\u201CI bribed the servants to tell me if you returned to the Veil,\u201D Jasnah said idly, picking up one of Shallan\u2019s tomes, reading the title. \u201CI didn\u2019t want to be interrupted again.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2014\u201D Shallan looked down, blushing furiously.\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t bother apologizing,\u201D Jasnah said. She looked tired; more tired than Shallan felt. Jasnah picked through the books. \u201CA fine selection. You chose well.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt wasn\u2019t really much of a choice,\u201D Shallan said. \u201CIt was just about all the merchant had.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou intended to study their contents quickly, I assume?\u201D Jasnah said musingly. \u201CTry to impress me one last time before I left Kharbranth?\u201D\r\nShallan hesitated, then nodded.\r\n\u201CA clever ploy. I should have put a time restriction on your reapplication.\u201D She looked at Shallan, glancing her over. \u201CYou are very determined. That is good. And I know why you wish so desperately to be my ward.\u201D\r\nShallan started. She\r\nknew?\r\n\u201CYour house has many enemies,\u201D Jasnah continued, \u201Cand your father is reclusive. It will be difficult for you to marry well without a tactically sound alliance.\u201D\r\nShallan relaxed, though she tried to keep it from showing.\r\n\u201CLet me see your satchel,\u201D Jasnah said.\r\nShallan frowned, resisting the urge to pull it close. \u201CBrightness?\u201D\r\nJasnah held out her hand. \u201CYou recall what I said about repeating myself?\u201D\r\nReluctantly, Shallan handed it over. Jasnah carefully removed its contents, neatly lining up the brushes, pencils, pens, jar of lacquer, ink, and solvent. She placed the stacks of paper, the notebooks, and the finished pictures in a line. Then she got out Shallan\u2019s money pouches, noting their emptiness. She glanced at the goblet lamp, counting its contents. She raised an eyebrow.\r\nNext, she began to look through Shallan\u2019s pictures. First the loose-leaf ones, where she lingered on Shallan\u2019s picture of Jasnah herself. Shallan watched the woman\u2019s face. Was she pleased? Surprised? Displeased at how much time Shallan spent sketching sailors and serving women?\r\nFinally, Jasnah moved on to the sketchbook filled with drawings of plants and animals Shallan had observed during her trip. Jasnah spent the longest on this, reading through each notation. \u201CWhy have you made these sketches?\u201D Jasnah asked at the end.\r\n\u201CWhy, Brightness? Well, because I wanted to.\u201D She grimaced. Should she have said something profound instead?\r\nJasnah nodded slowly. Then she rose. \u201CI have rooms in the Conclave, granted to me by the king. Gather your things and go there. You look exhausted.\u201D\r\n\u201CBrightness?\u201D Shallan asked, rising, a thrill of excitement running through her.\r\nJasnah hesitated at the doorway. \u201CAt first meeting, I took you for a rural opportunist, seeking only to ride my name to greater wealth.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou\u2019ve changed your mind?\u201D\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D Jasnah said, \u201Cthere is undoubtedly some of that in you. But we are each many different people, and you can tell much about a person by what they carry with them. If that notebook is any indication, you pursue scholarship in your free time for its own sake. That is encouraging. It is, perhaps, the best argument you could make on your own behalf.\r\n\u201CIf I cannot be rid of you, then I might as well make use of you. Go and sleep. Tomorrow we will begin early, and you will divide your time between your education and helping me with my studies.\u201D\r\nWith that, Jasnah withdrew.\r\nShallan sat, bemused, blinking tired eyes. She got out a sheet of paper and wrote a quick prayer of thanks, which she\u2019d burn later. Then she hurriedly gathered up her books and went looking for a servant to send to the\r\nWind\u2019s Pleasurefor her trunk.\r\nIt had been a very,\r\nverylong day. But she\u2019d won. The first step had been completed.\r\nNow her real task began."

      "ChapterName": "9: DAMNATION",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\n\u201CTen people, with Shardblades alight, standing before a wall of black and white and red.\u201D\r\n\u2014Collected: Jesachev, 1173, 12 seconds pre-death. Subject: one of our own ardents, overheard during his last moments.\r\nKaladin had not been assigned to Bridge Four by chance. Out of all the bridge crews, Bridge Four had the highest casualty rate. That was particularly notable, considering that average bridge crews often lost one-third to one-half of their number on a single run.\r\nKaladin sat outside, back to the barrack wall, a sprinkle of rain falling on him. It wasn\u2019t a highstorm. Just an ordinary spring rain. Soft. A timid cousin to the great storms.\r\nSyl sat on Kaladin\u2019s shoulder. Or hovered on it. Whatever. She didn\u2019t seem to have any weight. Kaladin sat slumped, chin against his chest, staring at a dip in the stone, which was slowly collecting rainwater.\r\nHe should have moved inside Bridge Four\u2019s barrack. It was cold and unfurnished, but it would keep off the rain. But he just\u2026couldn\u2019t care. How long had he been with Bridge Four now? Two weeks? Three? An eternity?\r\nOf the twenty-five men who had survived his first bridge deployment, twenty-three were now dead. Two had been moved to other bridge crews because they\u2019d done something to please Gaz, but they\u2019d died there. Only one other man and Kaladin remained. Two out of nearly forty.\r\nThe bridge crew\u2019s numbers had been replenished with more unfortunates, and most of those had died too. They had been replaced. Many of those had died. Bridgeleader after bridgeleader had been chosen. It was supposed to be a favored position on a bridge crew, always getting to run in the best places. It didn\u2019t matter for Bridge Four.\r\nSome bridge runs weren\u2019t as bad. If the Alethi arrived before the Parshendi, no bridgemen died. And if they arrived too late, sometimes another highprince was already there. Sadeas wouldn\u2019t help in that case; he\u2019d take his army and go back to camp. Even in a bad run, the Parshendi would often choose to focus their arrows on certain crews, trying to bring them down one at a time. Sometimes, dozens of bridgemen would fall, but not a single one from Bridge Four.\r\nThat was rare. For some reason, Bridge Four always seemed to get targeted. Kaladin didn\u2019t bother to learn the names of his companions. None of the bridgemen did. What was the point? Learn a man\u2019s name, and one of you would be dead before the week was out. Odds were, you\u2019d both be dead. Maybe he\r\nshouldlearn names. Then he\u2019d have someone to talk to in Damnation. They could reminisce about how terrible Bridge Four had been, and agree that eternal fires were much more pleasant.\r\nHe smirked dully, still staring at the rock in front of him. Gaz would come for them soon, send them to work. Scrubbing latrines, cleaning streets, mucking stables, gathering rocks. Something to keep their minds off their fate.\r\nHe still didn\u2019t know why they fought on those blustering plateaus. Something about those large chrysalises. They had gemstones at their hearts, apparently. But what did that have to do with the Vengeance Pact?\r\nAnother bridgeman\u2014a youthful Veden with reddish-blond hair\u2014lay nearby, staring up into the spitting sky. Rainwater pooled in the corners of his brown eyes, then ran down his face. He didn\u2019t blink.\r\nThey couldn\u2019t run. The warcamp might as well have been a prison. The bridgemen could go to the merchants and spend their meager earnings on cheap wine or whores, but they couldn\u2019t leave the warcamp. The perimeter was secure. Partially, this was to keep out soldiers from the other camps\u2014there was always rivalry where armies met. But mostly it was so bridgemen and slaves could not flee.\r\nWhy? Why did this all have to be so horrible? None of it made\r\nsense. Why not let a few bridgemen run out in front of the bridges with shields to block arrows? He\u2019d asked, and had been told that would slow them down too much. He\u2019d asked again, and had been told he\u2019d be strung up if he didn\u2019t shut his mouth.\r\nThe lighteyes acted as if this entire mess were some kind of grand game. If it was, the rules were hidden from bridgemen, just as pieces on a board had no inkling what the player\u2019s strategy might be.\r\n\u201CKaladin?\u201D Syl asked, floating down and landing on his leg, holding the girlish form with the long dress flowing into mist. \u201CKaladin? You haven\u2019t spoken in days.\u201D\r\nHe kept staring, slumped. There\r\nwasa way out. Bridgemen could visit the chasm nearest the camp. There were rules forbidding it, but the sentries ignored them. It was seen as the one mercy that could be given the bridgemen.\r\nBridgemen who took that path never returned.\r\n\u201CKaladin?\u201D Syl said, voice soft, worried.\r\n\u201CMy father used to say that there are two kinds of people in the world,\u201D Kaladin whispered, voice raspy. \u201CHe said there are those who take lives. And there are those who save lives.\u201D\r\nSyl frowned, cocking her head. This kind of conversation confused her; she wasn\u2019t good with abstractions.\r\n\u201CI used to think he was wrong. I thought there was a third group. People who killed in order to save.\u201D He shook his head. \u201CI was a fool. There\r\nisa third group, a big one, but it isn\u2019t what I thought.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat group?\u201D she said, sitting down on his knee, brow scrunched up.\r\n\u201CThe people who exist to be saved or to be killed. The group in the middle. The ones who can\u2019t do anything but die or be protected. The victims. That\u2019s all I am.\u201D\r\nHe looked up across the wet lumberyard. The carpenters had retreated, throwing tarps over untreated wood and bearing away tools that could rust. The bridgeman barracks ran around the west and north sides of the yard. Bridge Four\u2019s was set off a little from the others, as if bad luck were a disease that could be caught. Contagious by proximity, as Kaladin\u2019s father would say.\r\n\u201CWe exist to be killed,\u201D Kaladin said. He blinked, glancing at the other few members of Bridge Four sitting apathetically in the rain. \u201CIf we\u2019re not dead already.\u201D\r\n\u201CI hate seeing you like this,\u201D Syl said, buzzing about Kaladin\u2019s head as his team of bridgemen dragged a log down into the lumberyard. The Parshendi often set fire to the outermost permanent bridges, so Highprince Sadeas\u2019s engineers and carpenters were always busy.\r\nThe old Kaladin might have wondered why the armies didn\u2019t work harder to defend the bridges.\r\nThere\u2019s something wrong here!a voice inside him said.\r\nYou\u2019re missing part of the puzzle. They waste resources and bridgeman lives. They don\u2019t seem to care about pushing inward and assaulting the Parshendi. They just fight pitched battles on plateaus, then come back to the camps and celebrate. Why? WHY?\r\nHe ignored that voice. It belonged to the man he had been.\r\n\u201CYou used to be vibrant,\u201D Syl said. \u201CSo many looked up to you, Kaladin. Your squad of soldiers. The enemies you fought. The other slaves. Even some lighteyes.\u201D\r\nLunch would come soon. Then he could sleep until their bridgeleader kicked him awake for afternoon duty.\r\n\u201CI used to watch you fight,\u201D Syl said. \u201CI can barely remember it. My memories of then are fuzzy. Like looking at you through a rainstorm.\u201D\r\nWait. That was odd. Syl hadn\u2019t started following him until after his fall from the army. And she\u2019d acted just like a regular windspren back then. He hesitated, earning a curse and a lash on his back from a taskmaster\u2019s whip.\r\nHe started pulling again. Bridgemen who were laggard in work were whipped, and bridgemen who were laggard on runs were executed. The army was very serious about that. Refuse to charge the Parshendi, try to lag behind the other bridges, and you\u2019d be beheaded. They reserved that fate for that specific crime, in fact.\r\nThere were lots of ways to get punished as a bridgeman. You could earn extra work detail, get whipped, have your pay docked. If you did something really bad, they\u2019d string you up for the Stormfather\u2019s judgment, leaving you tied to a post or a wall to face a highstorm. But the only thing you could do to be executed directly was refuse to run at the Parshendi.\r\nThe message was clear. Charging with your bridge\r\nmightget you killed, but refusing to do so\r\nwouldget you killed.\r\nKaladin and his crew lifted their log into a pile with others, then unhooked their dragging lines. They walked back toward the edge of the lumberyard, where more logs waited.\r\n\u201CGaz!\u201D a voice called. A tall, yellow-and-black-haired soldier stood at the edge of the bridge grounds, a group of miserable men huddled behind him. That was Laresh, one of the soldiers who worked the duty tent. He brought new bridgemen to replace those who\u2019d been killed.\r\nThe day was bright, without a hint of clouds, and the sun was hot on Kaladin\u2019s back. Gaz hustled up to meet the new recruits, and Kaladin and the others happened to be walking in that direction to pick up a log.\r\n\u201CWhat a sorry lot,\u201D Gaz said, looking over the recruits. \u201COf course, if they weren\u2019t, they wouldn\u2019t be sent\r\nhere.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s the truth,\u201D Laresh said. \u201CThese ten at the front were caught smuggling. You know what to do.\u201D\r\nNew bridgemen were constantly needed, but there were always enough bodies. Slaves were common, but so were thieves or other lawbreakers from among the camp followers. Never parshmen. They were too valuable, and besides, the Parshendi were some kind of cousins to the parshmen. Better not to give the parshman workers in camp the sight of their kind fighting.\r\nSometimes a soldier would be thrown into a bridge crew. That only happened if he\u2019d done something extremely bad, like striking an officer. Acts that would earn a hanging in many armies meant being sent to the bridge crews here. Supposedly, if you survived a hundred bridge runs, you\u2019d be released. It had happened once or twice, the stories said. It was probably just a myth, intended to give the bridgemen some tiny hope for survival.\r\nKaladin and the others walked past the newcomers, gazes down, and began hooking their ropes to the next log.\r\n\u201CBridge Four needs some men,\u201D Gaz said, rubbing his chin.\r\n\u201CFour always needs men,\u201D Laresh said. \u201CDon\u2019t worry. I brought a special batch for it.\u201D He nodded toward a second group of recruits, much more ragtag, walking up behind.\r\nKaladin slowly stood upright. One of the prisoners in that group was a boy of barely fourteen or fifteen. Short, spindly, with a round face. \u201CTien?\u201D he whispered, taking a step forward.\r\nHe stopped, shaking himself. Tien was dead. But this newcomer looked so familiar, with those frightened black eyes. It made Kaladin want to shelter the boy. Protect him.\r\nBut\u2026he\u2019d failed. Everyone he\u2019d tried to protect\u2014from Tien to Cenn\u2014had ended up dead. What was the point?\r\nHe turned back to dragging the log.\r\n\u201CKaladin,\u201D Syl said, landing on the log, \u201CI\u2019m going to leave.\u201D\r\nHe blinked in shock. Syl. Leave? But\u2026she was the last thing he had left. \u201CNo,\u201D he whispered. It came out as a croak.\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll try to come back,\u201D she said. \u201CBut I don\u2019t know what will happen when I leave you. Things are strange. I have odd memories. No, most of them aren\u2019t even memories. Instincts. One of those tells me that if I leave you, I might lose myself.\u201D\r\n\u201CThen don\u2019t go,\u201D he said, growing terrified.\r\n\u201CI have to,\u201D she said, cringing. \u201CI can\u2019t watch this anymore. I\u2019ll try to return.\u201D She looked sorrowful. \u201CGoodbye.\u201D And with that, she zipped away into the air, adopting the form of a tiny group of tumbling, translucent leaves.\r\nKaladin watched her go, numb.\r\nThen he turned back to hauling the log. What else could he do?\r\nThe youth, the one that reminded him of Tien, died during the very next bridge run.\r\nIt was a bad one. The Parshendi were in position, waiting for Sadeas. Kaladin charged the chasm, not even flinching as men were slaughtered around him. It wasn\u2019t bravery that drove him; it wasn\u2019t even a wish that those arrows would take him and end it all. He ran. That was what he did. Like a boulder rolled down a hill, or like rain fell from the sky. They didn\u2019t have a\u00A0choice. Neither did he. He wasn\u2019t a man; he was a thing, and things just did what they did.\r\nThe bridgemen laid their bridges in a tight line. Four crews had fallen. Kaladin\u2019s own team had lost nearly enough stop them.\r\nBridge placed, Kaladin turned away, the army charging across the wood to start the real battle. He stumbled back across the plateau. After a few moments, he found what he was looking for. The boy\u2019s body.\r\nKaladin stood, wind whipping at his hair, looking down at the corpse. It lay faceup in a small hollow in the stone. Kaladin remembered lying in a similar hollow, holding a similar corpse.\r\nAnother bridgeman had fallen nearby, bristling with arrows. It was the man who\u2019d lived through Kaladin\u2019s first bridge run all those weeks back. His body slumped to the side, lying on a stone outcropping a foot or so above the corpse of the boy. Blood dripped from the tip of an arrow sticking out his back. It fell, one ruby drop at a time, splattering on the boy\u2019s open, lifeless eye. A little trail of red ran from the eye down the side of his face. Like crimson tears.\r\nThat night, Kaladin huddled in the barrack, listening to a highstorm buffet the wall. He curled against the cold stone. Thunder shattered the sky outside.\r\nI can\u2019t keep going like this,he thought.\r\nI\u2019m dead inside, as sure as if I\u2019d taken a spear through the neck.\r\nThe storm continued its tirade. And for the first time in a year, Kaladin found himself crying."

      "ChapterName": "10: STORIES OF SURGEONS",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\nNINE YEARS AGO\r\nKal stumbled into the surgery room, the open door letting in bright white sunlight. At ten years old, he was already showing signs that he would be tall and lanky. He\u2019d always preferred Kal to his full name, Kaladin. The shorter name made him fit in better. Kaladin sounded like a lighteyes\u2019s name.\r\n\u201CI\u2019m sorry, Father,\u201D he said.\r\nKal\u2019s father, Lirin, carefully tightened the strap around the arm of the young woman who was tied onto the narrow operating table. Her eyes were closed; Kal had missed the administration of the drug. \u201CWe will discuss your tardiness later,\u201D Lirin said, securing the woman\u2019s other hand. \u201CClose the door.\u201D\r\nKal cringed and closed the door. The windows were dark, shutters firmly in place, and so the only light was that of the Stormlight shining from a large globe filled with spheres. Each of those spheres was a broam, in total an incredible sum that was on permanent loan from Hearthstone\u2019s landlord. Lanterns flickered, but Stormlight was always true. That could save lives, Kal\u2019s father said.\r\nKal approached the table, anxious. The young woman, Sani, had sleek black hair, not tinged with even a single strand of brown or blond. She was fifteen, and her freehand was wrapped with a bloody, ragged bandage. Kal grimaced at the clumsy bandaging job\u2014it looked like the cloth had been ripped from someone\u2019s shirt and tied in haste.\r\nSani\u2019s head rolled to the side, and she mumbled, drugged. She wore only a white cotton shift, her safehand exposed. Older boys in the town sniggered about the chances they\u2019d had\u2014or\r\nclaimedto have had\u2014at seeing girls in their shifts, but Kal didn\u2019t understand what the excitement was all about. He\r\nwasworried about Sani, though. He always worried when someone was wounded.\r\nFortunately, the wound didn\u2019t look terrible. If it had been life-threatening, his father would have already begun working on it, using Kal\u2019s mother\u2014Hesina\u2014as an assistant.\r\nLirin walked to the side of the room and gathered up a few small, clear bottles. He was a short man, balding despite his relative youth. He wore his spectacles, which he called the most precious gift he\u2019d ever been given. He rarely got them out except for surgery, as they were too valuable to risk just wearing about. What if they were scratched or broken? Hearthstone was a large town, but its remote location in northern Alethkar would make replacing the spectacles difficult.\r\nThe room was kept neat, the shelves and table washed clean each morning, everything in its place. Lirin said you could tell a lot about a man from how he kept his workspace. Was it sloppy or orderly? Did he respect his tools or did he leave them casually about? The town\u2019s only fabrial clock sat here on the counter. The small device bore a single dial at the center and a glowing Smokestone at its heart; it had to be infused to keep the time. Nobody else in the town cared about minutes and hours as Lirin did.\r\nKal pulled over a stool to get a better vantage. Soon he wouldn\u2019t need the stool; he was growing taller by the day. He inspected Sani\u2019s hand.\r\nShe\u2019ll be all right,he told himself, as his father had trained him.\r\nA surgeon needs to be calm. Worry just wastes time.\r\nIt was hard advice to follow.\r\n\u201CHands,\u201D Lirin said, not turning away from gathering his tools.\r\nKal sighed, hopping off his stool and hurrying over to the basin of warm, soapy water by the door. \u201CWhy does it matter?\u201D He wanted to be at work, helping Sani.\r\n\u201CWisdom of the Heralds,\u201D Lirin said absently, repeating a lecture he\u2019d given many times before. \u201CDeathspren and rotspren hate water. It will keep them away.\u201D\r\n\u201CHammie says that\u2019s silly,\u201D Kal said. \u201CHe says deathspren are mighty good at killing folk, so why should they be afraid of a little water?\u201D\r\n\u201CThe Heralds were wise beyond our understanding.\u201D\r\nKal grimaced. \u201CBut they\u2019re\r\ndemons, father. I heard it off that ardent who came teaching last spring.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s the Radiants he spoke of,\u201D Lirin said sharply. \u201CYou\u2019re mixing them again.\u201D\r\nKal sighed.\r\n\u201CThe Heralds were sent to teach mankind,\u201D Lirin said. \u201CThey led us against the Voidbringers after we were cast from heaven. The Radiants were the orders of knights they founded.\u201D\r\n\u201CWho were demons.\u201D\r\n\u201CWho betrayed us,\u201D Lirin said, \u201Conce the Heralds left.\u201D Lirin raised a finger. \u201CThey were not demons, they were just men who had too much power and not enough sense. Either way, you are\r\nalwaysto wash your hands. You can see the effect it has on rotspren with your own eyes, even if deathspren cannot be seen.\u201D\r\nKal sighed again, but did as he was told. Lirin walked over to the table again, bearing a tray lined with knives and little glass bottles. His ways were odd\u2014though Lirin made certain that his son didn\u2019t mix up the Heralds and the Lost Radiants, Kal had heard his father say that he thought the Voidbringers weren\u2019t real. Ridiculous. Who else could be blamed when things went missing in the night, or when a crop got infected with digger-worms?\r\nThe others in town thought Lirin spent too much time with books and sick people, and that made him strange. They were uncomfortable around him, and with Kal by association. Kal was only just beginning to realize how painful it could feel to be different.\r\nHands washed, he hopped back up onto the stool. He began to feel nervous again, hoping that nothing would go wrong. His father used a mirror to focus the spheres\u2019 light onto Sani\u2019s hand. Gingerly, he cut off the makeshift bandage with a surgeon\u2019s knife. The wound wasn\u2019t life-threatening, but the hand\r\nwaspretty badly mangled. When his father had started training Kal two years before, sights like this had sickened him. Now he was used to torn flesh.\r\nThat was good. Kal figured this would be useful when he went to war someday, to fight for his highprince and the lighteyes.\r\nSani had three broken fingers and the skin on her hand was scraped and gouged, the wound cluttered with sticks and dirt. The third finger was the worst, shattered and twisted nastily, splinters of bone protruding through the skin. Kal felt its length, noting the fractured bones, the blackness on the skin. He carefully wiped away dried blood and dirt with a wet cloth, picking out rocks and sticks as his father cut thread for sewing.\r\n\u201CThe third finger will have to go, won\u2019t it?\u201D Kal said, tying a bandage around the base of the finger to keep it from bleeding.\r\nHis father nodded, a hint of a smile on his face. He\u2019d hoped Kal would discern that. Lirin often said that a wise surgeon must know what to remove and what to save. If that third finger had been set properly at first\u2026but no, it was beyond recovery. Sewing it back together would mean leaving it to fester and die.\r\nHis father did the actual amputation. He had such careful, precise hands. Training as a surgeon took over ten years, and it would be some time yet before Lirin let Kal hold the knife. Instead, Kal wiped away blood, handed his father knives, and held the sinew to keep it from tangling as his father sewed. They repaired the hand so far as they could, working with deliberate speed.\r\nKal\u2019s father finished the final suture, obviously pleased at having been able to save four of the fingers. That wasn\u2019t how Sani\u2019s parents would see it. They\u2019d be disappointed that their beautiful daughter would now have a disfigured hand. It almost always happened that way\u2014terror at the initial wound, then anger at Lirin\u2019s inability to work wonders. Lirin said it was because the townsfolk had grown accustomed to having a surgeon. To them, the healing had become an expectation, rather than a privilege.\r\nBut Sani\u2019s parents were good people. They\u2019d make a small donation, and Kal\u2019s family\u2014his parents, him, and his younger brother Tien\u2014would continue to be able to eat. Odd, how they survived because of others\u2019 misfortune. Maybe that was part of what made the townsfolk resent them.\r\nLirin finished by using a small heated rod to cauterize where he felt the stitches wouldn\u2019t be enough. Finally, he spread pungent lister\u2019s oil across the hand to prevent infection\u2014the oil frightened away rotspren even better than soap and water. Kal wrapped on clean bandages, careful not to disturb the splints.\r\nLirin disposed of the finger, and Kal began to relax. She\u2019d be all right.\r\n\u201CYou still need to work on those nerves of yours, son,\u201D Lirin said softly, washing blood from his hands.\r\nKal looked down.\r\n\u201CIt is good to care,\u201D Lirin said. \u201CBut caring\u2014like anything else\u2014can be a problem if it interferes with your ability to perform surgery.\u201D\r\nCaring too much can be a problem?Kal thought back at his father.\r\nAnd what about being so selfless that you never charge for your work?He didn\u2019t dare say the words.\r\nCleaning the room came next. It seemed like half of Kal\u2019s life was spent cleaning, but Lirin wouldn\u2019t let him go until they were done with it. At least he opened the shutters, letting sunlight stream in. Sani continued to doze; the winterwort would keep her unconscious for hours yet.\r\n\u201CSo where were you?\u201D Lirin asked, bottles of oil and alcohol clinking as he returned them to their places.\r\n\u201CWith Jam.\u201D\r\n\u201CJam is two years your senior,\u201D Lirin said. \u201CI doubt he has much fondness for spending his time with those much younger than he.\u201D\r\n\u201CHis father started training him in the quarterstaff,\u201D Kal said in a rush. \u201CTien and I went to see what he\u2019s learned.\u201D Kal cringed, waiting for the lecture.\r\nHis father just continued, wiping down each of his surgeon\u2019s knives with alcohol, then oil, as the old traditions dictated. He didn\u2019t turn toward Kal.\r\n\u201CJam\u2019s father was a soldier in Brightlord Amaram\u2019s army,\u201D Kal said tentatively. Brightlord Amaram! The noble lighteyed general who watched over northern Alethkar. Kal wanted so much to see a\r\nreallighteyes, not stuffy old Wistiow. A soldier, like everyone talked about, like the stories were about.\r\n\u201CI know about Jam\u2019s father,\u201D Lirin said. \u201CI\u2019ve had to operate on that lame leg of his three times now. A gift of his glorious time as a soldier.\u201D\r\n\u201CWe\r\nneedsoldiers, father. You\u2019d have our borders violated by the Thaylens?\u201D\r\n\u201CThaylenah is an island kingdom,\u201D Lirin said calmly. \u201CThey don\u2019t share a border with us.\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, then, they could attack from sea!\u201D\r\n\u201CThey\u2019re mostly tradesmen and merchants. Every one I\u2019ve met has tried to swindle me, but that\u2019s hardly the same thing as invading.\u201D\r\nAll the boys liked to tell stories about far-off places. It was hard to remember that Kal\u2019s father\u2014the only man of second nahn in the town\u2014had traveled all the way to Kharbranth during his youth.\r\n\u201CWell, we fight with\r\nsomeone,\u201D Kal continued, moving to scrub the floor.\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D his father said after a pause. \u201CKing Gavilar always finds people for us to fight. That much is true.\u201D\r\n\u201CSo we need soldiers, like I said.\u201D\r\n\u201CWe need surgeons more.\u201D Lirin sighed audibly, turning away from his cabinet. \u201CSon, you nearly cry each time someone is brought to us; you grind your teeth anxiously during even simple procedures. What makes you think you could actually\r\nhurtsomeone?\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll get stronger.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s foolishness. Who\u2019s put these ideas in your head?\r\nWhywould you want to learn to hit other boys with a stick?\u201D\r\n\u201CFor honor, Father,\u201D Kal said. \u201CWho tells stories about\r\nsurgeons, for the Heralds\u2019s sake!\u201D\r\n\u201CThe children of the men and women whose lives we save,\u201D Lirin said evenly, meeting Kal\u2019s gaze. \u201CThat\u2019s who tell stories of surgeons.\u201D\r\nKal blushed and shrank back, then finally returned to his scrubbing.\r\n\u201CThere are two kinds of people in this world, son,\u201D his father said sternly. \u201CThose who save lives. And those who take lives.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd what of those who protect and defend? The ones who save lives\r\nbytaking lives?\u201D\r\nHis father snorted. \u201CThat\u2019s like trying to stop a storm by blowing harder. Ridiculous. You can\u2019t protect by killing.\u201D\r\nKal kept scrubbing.\r\nFinally, his father sighed, walking over and kneeling down beside him, helping with the scrubbing. \u201CWhat are the properties of winterwort?\u201D\r\n\u201CBitter taste,\u201D Kal said immediately, \u201Cwhich makes it safer to keep, since people won\u2019t eat it by accident. Crush it to powder, mix it with oil, use one spoonful per ten brickweight of the person you\u2019re drugging. Induces a deep sleep for about five hours.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd how can you tell if someone has the fiddlepox?\u201D\r\n\u201CNervous energy,\u201D Kal said, \u201Cthirst, trouble sleeping, and swelling on the undersides of the arms.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou\u2019ve got such a good mind, son,\u201D Lirin said softly. \u201CIt took me years to learn what you\u2019ve done in months. I\u2019ve been saving. I\u2019d like to send you to Kharbranth when you turn sixteen, to train with real surgeons.\u201D\r\nKal felt a spike of excitement. Kharbranth? That was in an entirely different kingdom! Kal\u2019s father had traveled there as a courier, but he hadn\u2019t trained there as a surgeon. He\u2019d learned from old Vathe in Shorse broon, the nearest town of any size.\r\n\u201CYou have a gift from the Heralds themselves,\u201D Lirin said, resting a hand on Kal\u2019s shoulder. \u201CYou could be ten times the surgeon I am. Don\u2019t dream the small dreams of other men. Our grandfathers bought and worked us to the second nahn so that we could have full citizenship and the right of travel. Don\u2019t waste that on killing.\u201D\r\nKal hesitated, but soon found himself nodding."

      "ChapterName": "11: DROPLETS",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\n\u201CThree of sixteen ruled, but now the Broken One reigns.\u201D\r\n\u2014Collected: Chachanan, 1173, 84 seconds pre-death. Subject: a cutpurse with the wasting sickness, of partial Iriali descent.\r\nThe highstorm eventually subsided. It was the dusk of the day the boy had died, the day Syl had left him. Kaladin slid on his sandals\u2014the same ones he\u2019d taken from the leathery-faced man on that first day\u2014and stood up. He walked through the crowded barrack.\r\nThere were no beds, just one thin blanket per bridgeman. One had to choose whether to use it for cushioning or warmth. You could freeze or you could ache. Those were a bridgeman\u2019s options, though several of the bridgemen had found a third use for the blankets. They wrapped them around their heads, as if to block out sight, sound, and smell. To hide from the world.\r\nThe world would find them anyway. It was good at these kinds of games.\r\nRain fell in sheets outside, the wind still stiff. Flashes lit the western horizon, where the center of the storm flew onward. This was an hour or so before the riddens, and was as early as one would want to go out in a highstorm.\r\nWell, one never\r\nwantedto go out in a highstorm. But this was about as early as it was\r\nsafeto go out. The lightning had passed; the winds were manageable.\r\nHe passed through the dim lumberyard, hunched against the wind. Branches lay scattered about like bones in a whitespine\u2019s lair. Leaves were plastered by rainwater to the rough sides of barracks. Kaladin splashed through puddles that chilled and numbed his feet. That felt good; they were still sore from the bridge run earlier.\r\nWaves of icy rain blew across him, wetting his hair, dripping down his face and into his scruffy beard. He hated having a beard, particularly the way the whiskers itched at the corners of his mouth. Beards were like axehound pups. Boys dreamed of the day they\u2019d get one, never realizing how annoying they could be.\r\n\u201COut for a stroll, Your Lordship?\u201D a voice said.\r\nKaladin looked up to find Gaz huddled in a nearby hollow between two of the barracks. Why was he out in the rain?\r\nAh. Gaz had fastened a small metal basket on the leeward wall of one of the barracks, and a soft glowing light came from within. He left his spheres out in the storm, then had come out early to retrieve them.\r\nIt was a risk. Even a sheltered basket could get torn free. Some people believed that the shades of the Lost Radiants haunted the storms, stealing spheres. Perhaps that was true. But during his time in the army, Kaladin had known more than one man who had been wounded sneaking around during full storm, looking for spheres. No doubt the superstition was due to more worldly thieves.\r\nThere were safer ways to infuse spheres. Moneychangers would exchange dun spheres for infused ones, or you could pay them to infuse yours in one of their safely guarded nests.\r\n\u201CWhat are you doing?\u201D Gaz demanded. The short, one-eyed man clutched the basket to his chest. \u201CI\u2019ll have you strung up if you\u2019ve stolen anyone\u2019s spheres.\u201D\r\nKaladin turned away from him.\r\n\u201CStorm you! I\u2019ll have you strung up anyway! Don\u2019t think you can run away; there are still sentries. You\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m going to the Honor Chasm,\u201D Kaladin said quietly. His voice would barely be audible over the storm.\r\nGaz shut up. The Honor Chasm. He lowered his metal basket and made no further objections. There was a certain deference given to men who took that road.\r\nKaladin continued to cross the courtyard.\r\n\u201CLordling,\u201D Gaz called.\r\nKaladin turned.\r\n\u201CLeave the sandals and vest,\u201D Gaz said. \u201CI don\u2019t want to have to send someone down to fetch them.\u201D\r\nKaladin pulled the leather vest over his head and dropped it to the ground with a splash, then left the sandals in a puddle. That left him in a dirty shirt and stiff brown trousers, both taken off a dead man.\r\nKaladin walked through the storm to the east side of the lumberyard. A low thundering rumbled from the west. The pathway down to the Shattered Plains was familiar to him now. He\u2019d run this way a dozen times with the bridge crews. There wasn\u2019t a battle every day\u2014perhaps one in every two or three\u2014and not every bridge crew had to go on every run. But many of the runs were so draining, so horrific, that they left the bridgemen stunned, almost unresponsive, for the days between.\r\nMany bridgemen had trouble making decisions. The same happened to men who were shocked by battle. Kaladin felt those effects in himself. Even deciding to come to the chasm had been difficult.\r\nBut the bleeding eyes of that unnamed boy haunted him. He wouldn\u2019t make himself go through something like that again. He\r\ncouldn\u2019t.\r\nHe reached the base of the slope, wind-driven rain pelting his face as if trying to shove him back toward the camp. He kept on, walking up to the nearest chasm. The Honor Chasm, the bridgemen called it, for it was the place where they could make the one decision left to them. The \u201Chonorable\u201D decision. Death.\r\nThey weren\u2019t natural, these chasms. This one started narrow, but as it ran toward the east, it grew wider\u2014and deeper\u2014incredibly quickly. At only ten feet long, the crack was already wide enough that it would be difficult to jump. A group of six rope ladders with wooden rungs hung here, affixed to spikes in the rock, used by bridgemen sent down to salvage from corpses that had fallen into the chasms during bridge runs.\r\nKaladin looked out over the plains. He couldn\u2019t see much through the darkness and rain. No, this place wasn\u2019t natural. The land had been broken. And now it broke the people who came to it. Kaladin walked past the ladders, a little farther along the edge of the chasm. Then he sat down, legs over the side, looking down as the rain fell around him, the droplets plunging into the dark depths.\r\nTo his sides, the more adventurous cremlings had already left their lairs, scuttling about, feeding on plants that lapped up the rainwater. Lirin had once explained that highstorm rains were rich with nutrients. Stormwardens in Kholinar and Vedenar had proven that plants given storm water did better than those given lake or river water. Why was it that scientists were so excited to discover facts that farmers had known for generations and generations?\r\nKaladin watched the drops of water streaking down toward oblivion in the crevasse. Little suicidal jumpers. Thousands upon thousands of them. Millions upon millions. Who knew what awaited them in that darkness? You couldn\u2019t see it, couldn\u2019t know it, until you joined them. Leaping off into the void and letting the wind bear you down\u2026\r\n\u201CYou were right, Father,\u201D Kaladin whispered. \u201CYou can\u2019t stop a storm by blowing harder. You can\u2019t save men by killing others. We should all become surgeons. Every last one of us\u2026.\u201D\r\nHe was rambling. But, oddly, his mind felt clearer now than it had in weeks. Perhaps it was the clarity of perspective. Most men spent their entire lives wondering about the future. Well, his future was empty now. So he turned backward, thinking about his father, about Tien, about decisions.\r\nOnce, his life had seemed simple. That was before he\u2019d lost his brother, before he\u2019d been betrayed in Amaram\u2019s army. Would Kaladin go back to those innocent days, if he could? Would he prefer to pretend everything was simple?\r\nNo. He\u2019d had no easy fall, like those drops. He\u2019d earned his scars. He\u2019d bounced off walls, bashed his face and hands. He\u2019d killed innocent men by accident. He\u2019d walked beside those with hearts like blackened coals, adoring them. He\u2019d scrambled and climbed and fallen and stumbled.\r\nAnd now here he was. At the end of it all. Understanding so much more, but somehow feeling no wiser. He climbed to his feet on the lip of that chasm, and could feel his father\u2019s disappointment looming over him, like the thunderheads above.\r\nHe put one foot out over the void.\r\n\u201CKaladin!\u201D\r\nHe froze at the soft but piercing voice. A translucent form bobbed in the air, approaching through the weakening rain. The figure lunged forward, then sank, then surged higher again, like it was bearing something heavy. Kaladin brought his foot back and held out his hand. Syl unceremoniously alighted upon it, shaped like a skyeel clutching something dark in its mouth.\r\nShe switched to the familiar form of a young woman, dress fluttering around her legs. She held in her hands a narrow, dark green leaf with a point divided in three. Blackbane.\r\n\u201CWhat is this?\u201D Kaladin asked.\r\nShe looked exhausted. \u201CThese things are heavy!\u201D She lifted the leaf. \u201CI brought it for you!\u201D\r\nHe took the leaf between two fingers. Blackbane. Poison. \u201CWhy did you bring this to me?\u201D he said harshly.\r\n\u201CI thought\u2026\u201D Syl said, shying back. \u201CWell, you kept those other leaves so carefully. Then you lost them when you tried to help that man in the slave cages. I thought it would make you happy to have another one.\u201D\r\nKaladin almost laughed. She had no concept of what she\u2019d done, fetching him a leaf of one of Roshar\u2019s most deadly natural poisons because she\u2019d wanted to make him happy. It was ridiculous. And sweet.\r\n\u201CEverything seemed to go wrong when you lost that leaf,\u201D Syl said in a soft voice. \u201CBefore that, you fought.\u201D\r\n\u201CI failed.\u201D\r\nShe cowered down, kneeling on his palm, misty skirt around her legs, drops of rainwater passing through her and rippling her form. \u201CYou don\u2019t like it then? I flew so far\u2026I almost forgot myself. But I came back. I came\r\nback, Kaladin.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhy?\u201D he pled. \u201CWhy do you care?\u201D\r\n\u201CBecause I do,\u201D she said, cocking her head. \u201CI watched you, you know. Back in that army. You\u2019d always find the young, untrained men and protect them, even though it put you into danger. I can remember. Just barely, but I do.\u201D\r\n\u201CI failed them. They\u2019re dead now.\u201D\r\n\u201CThey would have died more quickly without you. You made it so they had a family in the army. I remember their gratitude. It\u2019s what drew me in the first place. You helped them.\u201D\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D he said, clutching the blackbane in his fingers. \u201CEverything I touch withers and dies.\u201D He teetered on the ledge. Thunder rumbled in the distance.\r\n\u201CThose men in the bridge crew,\u201D Syl whispered. \u201CYou could help them.\u201D\r\n\u201CToo late.\u201D He closed his eyes, thinking of the dead boy earlier in the day. \u201CIt\u2019s too late. I\u2019ve failed. They\u2019re dead. They\u2019re all going to die, and there\u2019s no way out.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat is one more try, then?\u201D Her voice was soft, yet somehow stronger than the storm. \u201CWhat could it hurt?\u201D\r\nHe paused.\r\n\u201CYou can\u2019t fail this time, Kaladin. You\u2019ve said it. They\u2019re all going to die anyway.\u201D\r\nHe thought of Tien, and his dead eyes staring upward.\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know what you mean most of the time when you speak,\u201D she said. \u201CMy mind is so cloudy. But it seems that if you\u2019re worried about hurting people, you shouldn\u2019t be afraid to help the bridgemen. What more could you do to them?\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2026\u201D\r\n\u201COne more try, Kaladin,\u201D Syl whispered. \u201CPlease.\u201D\r\nOne more try\u2026.\r\nThe men huddled in the barrack with barely a blanket to call their own. Frightened of the storm. Frightened of each other. Frightened of what the next day would bring.\r\nOne more try\u2026.\r\nHe thought of himself, crying at the death of a boy he hadn\u2019t known. A boy he hadn\u2019t even tried to help.\r\nOne more try.\r\nKaladin opened his eyes. He was cold and wet, but he felt a tiny, warm candle flame of determination come alight inside him. He clenched his hand, crushing the blackbane leaf inside, then dropped it over the side of the chasm. He lowered the other hand, which had been holding Syl.\r\nShe zipped up into the air, anxious. \u201CKaladin?\u201D\r\nHe stalked away from the chasm, bare feet splashing in puddles and stepping heedlessly on rockbud vines. The incline he\u2019d come down was covered with flat, slatelike plants that had opened like books to the rain, ruffled lacy red and green leaves connecting the two halves. Lifespren\u2014little green blips of light, brighter than Syl but small as spores\u2014danced among the plants, dodging raindrops.\r\nKaladin strode up, water streaming past him in tiny rivers. At the top, he returned to the bridge yard. It was still empty save for Gaz, who was tying a ripped tarp back into place.\r\nKaladin had crossed most of the distance to the man before Gaz noticed him. The wiry sergeant scowled. \u201CToo cowardly to go through with it, Your Lordship? Well, if you think I\u2019m giving back\u2014\u201D\r\nHe cut off with a gagging noise as Kaladin lunged forward, grabbing Gaz by the neck. Gaz lifted an arm in surprise, but Kaladin batted it away and swept the man\u2019s legs out from under him, slamming him down to the rocky ground, throwing up a splash of water. Gaz\u2019s eyes opened wide with shock and pain, and he began to strangle under the pressure of Kaladin\u2019s grip on his throat.\r\n\u201CThe world just changed, Gaz,\u201D Kaladin said, leaning in close. \u201CI died down at that chasm. Now you\u2019ve got my vengeful spirit to deal with.\u201D\r\nSquirming, Gaz looked about frantically for help that wasn\u2019t there. Kaladin didn\u2019t have trouble holding him down. There was one thing about running bridges: If you survived long enough, it built up the muscles.\r\nKaladin let up slightly on Gaz\u2019s neck, allowing him a gasping breath. Then Kaladin leaned down further. \u201CWe\u2019re going to start over new, you and I. Clean. And I want you to understand something from the start. I\u2019m\r\nalreadydead. You can\u2019t hurt me. Understand?\u201D\r\nGaz nodded slowly and Kaladin gave him another breath of frigid, humid air.\r\n\u201CBridge Four is mine,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CYou can assign us tasks, but I\u2019m bridgeleader. The other one died today, so you have to pick a new leader anyway. Understand?\u201D\r\nGaz nodded again.\r\n\u201CYou learn quickly,\u201D Kaladin said, letting the man breathe freely. He stepped back, and Gaz hesitantly got to his feet. There was hatred in his eyes, but it was veiled. He seemed worried about something\u2014something more than Kaladin\u2019s threats.\r\n\u201CI want to stop paying down my slave debt,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CHow much do bridgemen make?\u201D\r\n\u201CTwo clearmarks a day,\u201D Gaz said, scowling at him and rubbing his neck.\r\nSo a slave would make half that. One diamond mark. A pittance, but Kaladin would need it. He\u2019d also need to keep Gaz in line. \u201CI\u2019ll start taking my wages,\u201D Kaladin said, \u201Cbut you get to keep one mark in five.\u201D\r\nGaz started, glancing at him in the dim, overcast light.\r\n\u201CFor your efforts,\u201D Kaladin said.\r\n\u201CFor what efforts?\u201D\r\nKaladin stepped up to him. \u201CYour efforts in staying the\r\nDamnationout of my way. Understood?\u201D\r\nGaz nodded again. Kaladin walked away. He hated to waste money on a bribe, but Gaz needed a consistent, repetitive reminder of why he should avoid getting Kaladin killed. One mark every five days wasn\u2019t much of a reminder\u2014but for a man who was willing to risk going out in the middle of a highstorm to protect his spheres, it might be enough.\r\nKaladin walked back to Bridge Four\u2019s small barrack, pulling open the thick wooden door. The men huddled inside, just as he\u2019d left them. But something had changed. Had they always looked that pathetic?\r\nYes. They had. Kaladin was the one who had changed, not they. He felt a strange dislocation, as if he\u2019d allowed himself to forget\u2014if only in part\u2014the last nine months. He reached back across time, studying the man he had been. The man who\u2019d still fought, and fought well.\r\nHe couldn\u2019t be that man again\u2014he couldn\u2019t erase the scars\u2014but he could\r\nlearnfrom that man, as a new squadleader learned from the victorious generals of the past. Kaladin Stormblessed was dead, but Kaladin Bridgeman was of the same blood. A descendant with potential.\r\nKaladin walked to the first huddled figure. The man wasn\u2019t sleeping\u2014who could sleep through a highstorm? The man cringed as Kaladin knelt beside him.\r\n\u201CWhat\u2019s your name?\u201D Kaladin asked, Syl flitting down and studying the man\u2019s face. He wouldn\u2019t be able to see her.\r\nThe man was older, with drooping cheeks, brown eyes, and close-cropped, white-salted hair. His beard was short and he didn\u2019t have a slave mark.\r\n\u201CYour name?\u201D Kaladin repeated firmly.\r\n\u201CStorm off,\u201D the man said, rolling over.\r\nKaladin hesitated, then leaned in, speaking in a low voice. \u201CLook, friend. You can either tell me your name, or I\u2019ll keep pestering you. Continue refusing, and I\u2019ll tow you out into that storm and hang you over the chasm by one leg until you tell me.\u201D\r\nThe man glanced back over his shoulder. Kaladin nodded slowly, holding the man\u2019s gaze.\r\n\u201CTeft,\u201D the man finally said. \u201CMy name\u2019s Teft.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat wasn\u2019t so hard,\u201D Kaladin said, holding out his hand. \u201CI\u2019m Kaladin. Your bridgeleader.\u201D\r\nThe man hesitated, then took Kaladin\u2019s hand, wrinkling his brow in confusion. Kaladin vaguely remembered the man. He\u2019d been in the crew for a while, a few weeks at least. Before that, he\u2019d been on another bridge crew. One of the punishments for bridgemen who committed camp infractions was a transfer to Bridge Four.\r\n\u201CGet some rest,\u201D Kaladin said, releasing Teft\u2019s hand. \u201CWe\u2019re going to have a hard day tomorrow.\u201D\r\n\u201CHow do you know?\u201D Teft asked, rubbing his bearded chin.\r\n\u201CBecause we\u2019re bridgemen,\u201D Kaladin said, standing. \u201C\r\nEveryday is hard.\u201D\r\nTeft hesitated, then smiled faintly. \u201CKelek knows that\u2019s true.\u201D\r\nKaladin left him, moving down the line of huddled figures. He visited each man, prodding or threatening until the man gave his name. They each resisted. It was as if their names were the last things they owned, and wouldn\u2019t be given up cheaply, though they seemed surprised\u2014perhaps even encouraged\u2014that someone cared to ask.\r\nHe clutched to these names, repeating each one in his head, holding them like precious gemstones. The names mattered. The men mattered. Perhaps Kaladin would die in the next bridge run, or perhaps he would break under the strain, and give Amaram one final victory. But as he settled down on the ground to plan, he felt that tiny warmth burning steadily within him.\r\nIt was the warmth of decisions made and purpose seized. It was responsibility.\r\nSyl alighted on his leg as he sat, whispering the names of the men to himself. She looked encouraged. Bright. Happy. He didn\u2019t feel any of that. He felt grim, tired, and wet. But he wrapped himself in the responsibility he had taken, the responsibility for these men. He held to it like a climber clung to his last handhold as he dangled from a cliffside.\r\nHe\r\nwouldfind a way to protect them.\r\nTHE END OF\r\nPart One"

      "ChapterName": "1-1: ISHIKK",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\nIshikk splashed toward the meeting with the strange foreigners, whistling softly to himself, his pole with buckets on each end resting on his shoulders. He wore lake sandals on his submerged feet and a pair of knee-length breeches. No shirt. Nu Ralik forbid! A good Purelaker never covered his shoulders when the sun was shining. A man could get sick that way, not getting enough sunlight.\r\nHe whistled, but not because he was having a pleasant day. In point of fact, the day Nu Ralik had provided was close to horrible. Only five fish swam in Ishikk\u2019s buckets, and four were of the dullest, most common variety. The tides had been irregular, as if the Purelake itself was in a foul mood. Bad days were coming; sure as the sun and the tide, they were.\r\nThe Purelake extended in all directions, hundreds of miles wide, its glassy surface perfectly transparent. At its deepest, it was never more than six feet from shimmering surface to the bottom\u2014and in most places, the warm, slow-moving water came up only to about mid calf. It was filled with tiny fish, colorful cremlings, and eel-like riverspren.\r\nThe Purelake was life itself. Once, this land had been claimed by a king. Sela Tales, the nation had been called, one of the Epoch Kingdoms. Well, they could name it what they wanted, but Nu Ralik knew that the boundaries of nature were far more important than the boundaries of nations. Ishikk was a Purelaker. First and foremost. By tide and sun he was.\r\nHe walked confidently through the water, though the footing could sometimes be precarious. The pleasantly warm water lapped at his legs just below the knees, and he made very few splashes. He knew to move slowly, careful not to put his weight down before he was sure he wasn\u2019t stepping on a spikemane or a sharp lip of rock.\r\nAhead, the village of Fu Abra broke the glassy perfection, a cluster of buildings perched on blocks beneath the water. Their domed roofs made them look like the rockbuds that sprouted from the ground, and they were the only things for miles around that broke the surface of the Purelake.\r\nOther people walked about here, moving with the same slow gait. It was possible to run through the water, but there was rarely a reason. What could be so important that you had to go and make a splash and ruckus getting to it?\r\nIshikk shook his head at that. Only foreigners were so hasty. He nodded to Thaspic, a dark-skinned man who passed him pulling a small raft. It was stacked with a few piles of cloth; he\u2019d probably taken them out for washing.\r\n\u201CHo, Ishikk,\u201D the scrawny man said. \u201CHow\u2019s fishing?\u201D\r\n\u201CTerrible,\u201D he called. \u201CVun Makak has blighted me right good today. And you?\u201D\r\n\u201CLost a shirt while washing,\u201D Thaspic replied, his voice pleasant.\r\n\u201CAh, that\u2019s the way of things. Are my foreigners here?\u201D\r\n\u201CSure are. Over at Maib\u2019s place.\u201D\r\n\u201CVun Makak send they don\u2019t eat her out of home,\u201D Ishikk said, continuing on his way. \u201COr infect her with their constant worries.\u201D\r\n\u201CSun and tides send it!\u201D Thaspic said with a chuckle, continuing on.\r\nMaib\u2019s house was near the center of the village. Ishikk wasn\u2019t sure what made her want to live inside the building. Most nights he did just fine sleeping on his raft. It never got cold in the Purelake, except during highstorms, and you could last through those right well, Nu Ralik send the way.\r\nThe Purelake drained into pits and holes when the storms came, and so you just shoved your raft into a crevice between two ridges of stone and huddled up next to it, using it to break the fury of the tempest. The storms weren\u2019t so bad out here as they were in the East, where they flung boulders and blew down buildings. Oh, he\u2019d heard stories about that sort of life. Nu Ralik send he never had to go to such a terrible place.\r\nBesides, it was probably cold there. Ishikk pitied those who had to live in the cold. Why didn\u2019t they just come to the Purelake?\r\nNu Ralik send that they don\u2019t,he thought, walking up to Maib\u2019s place. If everyone knew how nice the Purelake was, surely they\u2019d all want to live here, and there wouldn\u2019t be a place to walk without stumbling over some foreigner!\r\nHe stepped up into the building, exposing his calves to the air. The floor was low enough that a few inches of water still covered it; Purelakers liked it that way. It was natural, though if the tide dropped, sometimes buildings would drain.\r\nMinnows shot out around his toes. Common types, not worth anything. Maib stood inside, fixing a pot of fish soup, and she nodded to him. She was a stout woman and had been chasing Ishikk for years, trying to bait him to wed her on account of her fine cooking. He just might let her catch him someday.\r\nHis foreigners were in the corner, at a table only they would choose\u2014the one that was raised up an extra bit, with footrests so that the outsiders wouldn\u2019t have to get their toes wet.\r\nNu Ralik, what fools!he thought with amusement.\r\nInside out of the sun, wearing shirts against its warmth, feet out of the tide. No wonder their thoughts are so odd.\r\nHe set his buckets down, nodding to Maib.\r\nShe eyed him. \u201CGood fishing?\u201D\r\n\u201CTerrible.\u201D\r\n\u201CAh well, your soup is free today, Ishikk. To make up for Vun Makak\u2019s cursing.\u201D\r\n\u201CThanks much kindly,\u201D he said, taking a steaming bowl from her. She smiled. Now he owed her. Enough bowls, and he\u2019d be forced to wed her.\r\n\u201CThere\u2019s a kolgril in the bucket for you,\u201D he noted. \u201CCaught it early this morning.\u201D\r\nHer stout face grew uncertain. A kolgril was a\r\nverylucky fish. Cured aching joints for a good month after you ate it, and sometimes let you see when friends were going to visit by letting you read the shapes of the clouds. Maib had quite a fondness for them, on account of the finger aches Nu Ralik had sent her. One kolgril would be two weeks of soup, and would put\r\nherin debt to\r\nhim.\r\n\u201CVun Makak eye you,\u201D she muttered in annoyance walking over to check. \u201CThat\u2019s one all right. How am I ever going to catch you, man?\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m a fisher, Maib,\u201D he said, taking a slurp of his soup\u2014the bowl was shaped for easy slurping. \u201CHard to catch a fisher. You know that.\u201D He chuckled to himself, walking up to his foreigners as she plucked out the kolgril.\r\nThere were three of them. Two were dark-skinned Makabaki, though they were the strangest Makabaki he\u2019d ever seen. One was thick limbed where most of his kind were small and fine-boned, and he had a completely bald head. The other was taller, with short dark hair, lean muscles, and broad shoulders. In his head, Ishikk called them Grump and Blunt, on account of their personalities.\r\nThe third man had light tan skin, like an Alethi. He didn\u2019t seem quite right either, though. The eyes were the wrong shape, and his accent was certainly\r\nnotAlethi. He spoke the Selay language worse than the other two, and usually stayed quiet. He seemed thoughtful, though. Ishikk called him Thinker.\r\nWonder how he earned that scar across his scalp,Ishikk thought. Life outside the Purelake was very dangerous. Lots of wars, particularly to the east.\r\n\u201CYou are late, traveler,\u201D said tall, stiff Blunt. He had the build and air of a soldier, though none of the three carried weapons.\r\nIshikk frowned, sitting and reluctantly pulling his feet out of the water. \u201CIsn\u2019t it warli-day?\u201D\r\n\u201CThe day is right, friend,\u201D Grump said. \u201CBut we were to meet at noon. Understand?\u201D He generally did most of the talking.\r\n\u201CWe\u2019re close to that,\u201D Ishikk said. Honestly. Who paid attention to what\r\nhourit was? Foreigners. Always so busy.\r\nGrump just shook his head as Maib brought them some soup. Her place was the closest thing the village had to an inn. She left Ishikk a soft cloth napkin and nice cup of sweet wine, trying to balance that fish as quickly as possible.\r\n\u201CVery well,\u201D Grump said. \u201CLet us have your report, friend.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve been by Fu Ralis, Fu Namir, Fu Albast, and Fu Moorin this month,\u201D Ishikk said, taking a slurp of soup. \u201CNobody has seen this man you search for.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou asked right questions?\u201D Blunt said. \u201CYou are certain?\u201D\r\n\u201COf course I\u2019m certain,\u201D Ishikk said. \u201CI have been doing this for ages now.\u201D\r\n\u201CFive months,\u201D Blunt corrected. \u201CAnd no results.\u201D\r\nIshikk shrugged. \u201CYou wish me to make up stories? Vun Makak would like me to do that.\u201D\r\n\u201CNo, no stories, friend,\u201D Grump said. \u201CWe want only the truth.\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, I\u2019ve given it to you.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou swear it by Nu Ralik, that god of yours?\u201D\r\n\u201CHush!\u201D Ishikk said. \u201CDon\u2019t say his name. Are you idiots?\u201D\r\nGrump frowned. \u201CBut he is your god. Understand? Is his name holy? Not to be spoken?\u201D\r\nForeigners were so stupid. Of course Nu Ralik was their god, but you always\r\npretendedthat he wasn\u2019t. Vun Makak\u2014his younger, spiteful brother\u2014had to be tricked into thinking you worshipped him, otherwise he\u2019d get jealous. It was only safe to speak of these things in a holy grotto.\r\n\u201CI swear it by Vun Makak,\u201D Ishikk said pointedly. \u201CMay he watch over me and curse me as he pleases. I have looked diligently. No foreigner like this one you mention\u2014with his white hair, clever tongue, and arrowlike face\u2014has been seen.\u201D\r\n\u201CHe dyes his hair sometimes,\u201D Grump said. \u201CAnd wears disguises.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve asked, using the names you gave me,\u201D Ishikk said. \u201CNobody has seen him. Now, perhaps I could find you a\r\nfishthat could locate him.\u201D Ishikk rubbed his stubbly chin. \u201CI\u2019ll bet a stumpy cort could do it. Might take me a while to find one, though.\u201D\r\nThe three looked at him. \u201CThere may be something to these fish, you know,\u201D Blunt said.\r\n\u201CSuperstition,\u201D Grump replied. \u201CYou always look for superstition, Vao.\u201D\r\nVao wasn\u2019t the man\u2019s real name; Ishikk was sure they used fake names. That was why he used his own names for them. If they were going to give him fake names, he\u2019d give them fake names back.\r\n\u201CAnd you, Temoo?\u201D Blunt snapped. \u201CWe can\u2019t pontificate our way to\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CGentlemen,\u201D Thinker said. He nodded to Ishikk, who was still slurping his soup. All three of them switched to another language and continued their argument.\r\nIshikk listened with half an ear, trying to determine what language it was. He never had been good with other kinds of languages. Why did he need them? Didn\u2019t help with fishing or selling fish.\r\nHe\r\nhadsearched for their man. He got around a lot, visited a lot of places around the Purelake. It was one of the reasons why he didn\u2019t want to be caught by Maib. He\u2019d have to settle down, and that wasn\u2019t good for catching fish. Not the rare ones, at least.\r\nHe didn\u2019t bother wondering why they were looking for this Hoid, whoever he was. Foreigners were always looking for things they couldn\u2019t have. Ishikk sat back, dangling his toes in the water. That felt good. Eventually, they finished their argument. They gave him some more instructions, handed him a pouch of spheres, and stepped down into the water.\r\nLike most foreigners, they wore thick boots that came all the way up to their knees. They splashed in the water as they walked to the entrance. Ishikk followed, waving to Maib and picking up his buckets. He\u2019d be back later in the day for an evening meal.\r\nMaybe Ishould\r\nlet her catch me,he thought, stepping back out into the sunlight and sighing in relief.\r\nNu Ralik knows I\u2019m getting old. Might be nice to relax.\r\nHis foreigners splashed down into the Purelake. Grump was last. He seemed very dissatisfied. \u201CWhere are you, Roamer? What a fool\u2019s quest this is.\u201D Then, he added in his own tongue,\r\n\u201CAlavanta kamaloo kayana.\u201D\r\nHe splashed after his companions.\r\n\u201CWell, you\u2019ve got the \u2018fool\u2019 part right,\u201D Ishikk said with a chuckle, turning his own direction and heading off to check on his traps."

      "ChapterName": "1-2: NAN BALAT",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\nNan Balat liked killing things.\r\nNot people. Never people. But animals, those he could kill.\r\nParticularly the little ones. He wasn\u2019t sure why it made him feel better; it simply did.\r\nHe sat on the porch of his mansion, pulling the legs off a small crab one at a time. There was a satisfying rip to each one\u2014he pulled on it lightly at first, and the animal grew stiff. Then he pulled harder, and it started to squirm. The ligament resisted, then started ripping, followed by a quick pop. The crab squirmed some more, and Nan Balat held up the leg, pinching the beast with two fingers on his other hand.\r\nHe sighed in satisfaction. Ripping a leg free soothed him, made the aches in his body retreat. He tossed the leg over his shoulder and moved on to the next one.\r\nHe didn\u2019t like to talk about his habit. He didn\u2019t even speak of it to Eylita. It was just something he did. You had to keep your sanity somehow.\r\nHe finished with the legs, then stood up, leaning on his cane, looking out over the Davar gardens, which were made up of stonework walls covered with different kinds of vines. They were beautiful, though Shallan had been the only one who truly appreciated them. This area of Jah Keved\u2014to the west and south of Alethkar, of higher elevation and broken by mountains such as the Horneater Peaks\u2014had a profusion of vines. They grew on everything, covering the mansion, growing over the steps. Out in the wilds, they hung from trees, grew over rocky expanses, as ubiquitous as grass was in other areas of Roshar.\r\nBalat walked to the edge of the porch. Some wild songlings began to sing in the distance, scraping their ridged shells. They each played a different beat and notes, though they couldn\u2019t really be called melodies. Melodies were things of humans, not animals. But each one\r\nwasa song, and at times they seemed to sing back and forth to one another.\r\nBalat walked down the steps one at a time, the vines shaking and pulling away before his feet fell. It had been nearly six months since Shallan\u2019s departure. This morning, they\u2019d had word from her via spanreed that she\u2019d succeeded in the first part of her plan, becoming Jasnah Kholin\u2019s ward. And so, his baby sister\u2014who before this had never left their estates\u2014was preparing to rob the most important woman in the world.\r\nWalking down the steps was depressingly hard work for him.\r\nTwenty-three years old,he thought,\r\nand already a cripple.He still felt a constant, latent ache. The break had been bad, and the surgeon had nearly decided to cut off the entire leg. Perhaps he could be thankful that hadn\u2019t proven necessary, though he would always walk with a cane.\r\nScrak was playing with something in the sitting green, a place where cultivated grass was grown and kept free of vines. The large axehound rolled about, gnawing at the object, antennae pulled back flat against her skull.\r\n\u201CScrak,\u201D Balat said, hobbling forward, \u201Cwhat have you got there, girl?\u201D\r\nThe axehound looked up at her master, antennae cocking upward. The hound trumped with two echoing voices overlapping one another, then went back to playing.\r\nBlasted creature,Balat thought fondly,\r\nnever would obey properly.He\u2019d been breeding axehounds since his youth, and had discovered\u2014as had many before him\u2014that the smarter an animal was, the more likely it was to disobey. Oh, Scrak was loyal, but she\u2019d ignore you on the little things. Like a young child trying to prove her independence.\r\nAs he got closer, he saw that Scrak had managed to catch a songling. The fist-sized creature was shaped like a peaked disc with four arms that reached out from the sides and scraped rhythms along the top. Four squat legs underneath normally held it to a rock wall, though Scrak had chewed those off. She had two of the arms off too, and had managed to crack the shell. Balat almost took it away to pull the other two arms off, but decided it was best to let Scrak have her fun.\r\nScrak set the songling down and looked up at Balat, her antennae rising inquisitively. She was sleek and lean, six legs extending before her as she sat on her haunches. Axehounds didn\u2019t have shells or skin; instead, their body was covered with some fusion of the two, smooth to the touch and more pliable than true carapace, but harder than skin and made of interlocking sections. The axehound\u2019s angular face seemed curious, her deep black eyes regarding Balat. She trumped softly.\r\nBalat smiled, reaching down and scratching behind the axehound\u2019s ear holes. The animal leaned against him\u2014she probably weighed as much as he did. The bigger axehounds came up to a man\u2019s waist, though Scrak was of a smaller, quicker breed.\r\nThe songling quivered and Scrak pounced on it eagerly, crunching at its shell with her strong outer mandibles.\r\n\u201CAm I a coward, Scrak?\u201D Balat asked, sitting down on a bench. He set his cane aside and snatched a small crab that had been hiding on the side of the bench, its shell having turned white to match the stone.\r\nHe held up the squirming animal. The green\u2019s grass had been bred to be less timid, and it poked out of its holes only a few moments after he passed. Other exotic plants bloomed, poking out of shells or holes in the ground, and soon patches of red, orange, and blue waved in the wind around him. The area around the axehound remained bare, of course. Scrak was having far too much fun with her prey, and she kept even the cultivated plants hidden in their burrows.\r\n\u201CI couldn\u2019t have gone to chase Jasnah,\u201D Balat said, starting to pull the crab\u2019s legs off. \u201COnly a woman could get close enough to her to steal the Soulcaster. We decided that. Besides, someone needs to stay back and care for the needs of the house.\u201D\r\nThe excuses were hollow. He\r\ndidfeel like a coward. He pulled off a few more legs, but it was unsatisfying. The crab was too small, and the legs came off too easily.\r\n\u201CThis plan probably won\u2019t even work,\u201D he said, taking off the last of the legs. Odd, looking at a creature like this when it had no legs. The crab was still alive. Yet how could you know it? Without the legs to wiggle, the creature seemed as dead as a stone.\r\nThe arms,he thought,\r\nwe wave them about to make us seem alive. That\u2019s what they\u2019re good for.He put his fingers between the halves of the crab\u2019s shell and began to pry them apart. This, at least, had a nice feeling of resistance to it.\r\nThey were a broken family. Years of suffering their father\u2019s brutal temper had driven Asha Jushu to vice and Tet Wikim to despair. Only Balat had escaped unscathed. Balat and Shallan. She\u2019d been left alone, never touched. At times, Balat had hated her for that, but how could you truly hate someone like Shallan? Shy, quiet, delicate.\r\nI should never have let her go,he thought.\r\nThere should have been another way.She\u2019d never manage on her own; she was probably terrified. It was a wonder she\u2019d done as much as she had.\r\nHe tossed the pieces of crab over his shoulder.\r\nIf only Helaran had survived.Their eldest brother\u2014then known as Nan Helaran, as he\u2019d been the first son\u2014had stood up to their father repeatedly. Well, he was dead now, and so was their father. They\u2019d left behind a family of cripples.\r\n\u201CBalat!\u201D a voice cried. Wikim appeared on the porch. The younger man was past his recent bout of melancholy, it appeared.\r\n\u201CWhat?\u201D Balat said, standing.\r\nWikim rushed down the steps, hurrying up to him, vines\u2014then grass\u2014pulling back before him. \u201CWe have a problem.\u201D\r\n\u201CHow large a problem?\u201D\r\n\u201CPretty big, I\u2019d say. Come on.\u201D"

      "ChapterName": "1-3: THE GLORY OF IGNORANCE",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\nSzeth-son-son-Vallano, Truthless of Shinovar, sat on the wooden tavern floor, lavis beer slowly soaking through his brown trousers.\r\nGrimy, worn, and fraying, his clothing was far different from the simple\u2014yet elegant\u2014whites he had worn over five years before when he\u2019d assassinated the king of Alethkar.\r\nHead bowed, hands in his lap, he carried no weapons. He hadn\u2019t summoned his Shardblade in years, and it felt equally long since he\u2019d had a bath. He did not complain. If he looked like a wretch, people treated him as a wretch. One did not ask a wretch to assassinate people.\r\n\u201CSo he\u2019ll do whatever you say?\u201D asked one of the mine workers sitting at the table. The man\u2019s clothing was little better than Szeth\u2019s, covered with so much dirt and dust that it was difficult to tell grimy skin from grimy cloth. There were four of them, holding ceramic cups. The room smelled of mud and sweat. The ceiling was low, the windows\u2014on the leeward side only\u2014mere slots. The table was precariously held together with several leather straps, as the wood was cracked down the middle.\r\nTook\u2014Szeth\u2019s current master\u2014set his cup down on the table\u2019s tilted side. It sagged under the weight of his arm. \u201CYeah, he sure will. Hey, kurp, look at me.\u201D\r\nSzeth looked up. \u201CKurp\u201D meant child in the local Bav dialect. Szeth was accustomed to such pejorative labels. Though he was in his thirty-fifth year\u2014and his seventh year since being named Truthless\u2014his people\u2019s large, round eyes, shorter stature, and tendency toward baldness led Easterners to claim they looked like children.\r\n\u201CStand up,\u201D Took said.\r\nSzeth did so.\r\n\u201CJump up and down.\u201D\r\nSzeth complied.\r\n\u201CPour Ton\u2019s beer on your head.\u201D\r\nSzeth reached for it.\r\n\u201CHey!\u201D Ton said, pulling the cup away. \u201CNone of that, now! Oi ain\u2019t done with this yet!\u201D\r\n\u201CIf you were,\u201D said Took, \u201Che couldn\u2019t right pour it on his head, could he?\u201D\r\n\u201CGet \u2019im to do something else, Took,\u201D Ton griped.\r\n\u201CAll right.\u201D Took pulled out his boot knife and tossed it to Szeth. \u201CKurp, cut your arm up.\u201D\r\n\u201CTook\u2026\u201D said one of the other men, a sniffly man named Amark. \u201CThat ain\u2019t right, you know it.\u201D\r\nTook didn\u2019t rescind the order, so Szeth complied, taking the knife and cutting at the flesh of his arm. Blood seeped out around the dirty blade.\r\n\u201CCut your throat,\u201D Took said.\r\n\u201CNow, Took!\u201D Amark said, standing. \u201COi won\u2019t\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201COh hush, you,\u201D Took said. Several groups of men from other tables were watching now. \u201CYou\u2019ll see. Kurp, cut your throat.\u201D\r\n\u201CI am forbidden to take my own life,\u201D Szeth said softly in the Bav language. \u201CAs Truthless, it is the nature of my suffering to be forbidden the taste of death by my own hand.\u201D\r\nAmark settled back down, looking sheepish.\r\n\u201CDustmother,\u201D Ton said, \u201Che always talks like that?\u201D\r\n\u201CLike what?\u201D Took asked, taking a gulp from his mug.\r\n\u201CSmooth words, so soft and proper. Like a lighteyes.\u201D\r\n\u201CYeah,\u201D Took said. \u201CHe\u2019s like a slave, only better \u2019cuz he\u2019s a Shin. He don\u2019t run or talk back or anything. Don\u2019t have to pay him, neither. He\u2019s like a parshman, but smarter. Worth a right many spheres, Oi\u2019d say.\u201D He eyed the other men. \u201CCould take him to the mines with you to work, and collect his pay. He\u2019d do things you don\u2019t wanna. Muck out the privy, whitewash the home. All kinds of useful stuff.\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, how\u2019d you come by him, then?\u201D one of the other men asked, scratching his chin. Took was a transient worker, moving from town to town. Displaying Szeth was one of the ways he made quick friends.\r\n\u201COh, now, that\u2019s a story,\u201D Took said. \u201COi was traveling in the mountains down south, you know, and Oi heard this weird howling noise. It wasn\u2019t joust the wind, you know, and\u2026\u201D\r\nThe tale was a complete fabrication; Szeth\u2019s previous master\u2014a farmer in a nearby village\u2014had traded Szeth to Took for a sack of seeds. The farmer had gotten him from a traveling merchant, who had gotten him from a cobbler who\u2019d won him in an illegal game of chance. There had been dozens before him.\r\nAt first, the darkeyed commoners enjoyed the novelty of owning him.\r\nSlaves were far too expensive for most, and parshmen were even more valuable. So having someone like Szeth to order around was quite the novelty. He cleaned floors, sawed wood, helped in the fields, and carried burdens. Some treated him well, some did not.\r\nBut they always got rid of him.\r\nPerhaps they could sense the truth, that he was capable of so much more than they dared use him for. It was one thing to have a slave of your own. But when that slave talked like a lighteyes and knew more than you did? It made them uncomfortable.\r\nSzeth tried to play the part, tried to make himself act less refined. It was very difficult for him. Perhaps impossible. What would these men say if they knew that the man who emptied their chamber pot was a Shardbearer and a Surgebinder? A Windrunner, like the Radiants of old? The moment he summoned his Blade, his eyes would turn from dark green to pale\u2014almost glowing\u2014sapphire, a unique effect of his particular weapon.\r\nBest that they never discovered. Szeth gloried in being wasted; each day he was made to clean or dig instead of kill was a victory. That evening five years ago still haunted him. Before then, he had been ordered to kill\u2014but always in secret, silently. Never before had he been given such deliberately terrible instructions.\r\nKill, destroy, and cut your way to the king. Be seen doing it. Leave witnesses. Wounded but alive\u2026.\r\n\u201C\u2026and\r\nthatis when he swore to serve me my entire life,\u201D Took finished. \u201CHe\u2019s been with me ever since.\u201D\r\nThe listening men turned to Szeth. \u201CIt is true,\u201D he said, as he\u2019d been ordered earlier. \u201CEvery word of it.\u201D\r\nTook smiled. Szeth didn\u2019t make him uncomfortable; he apparently considered it natural that Szeth obeyed him. Perhaps as a result he would remain Szeth\u2019s master longer than the others.\r\n\u201CWell,\u201D Took said, \u201COi should be going. Need to get an early start tomorrow. More places to see, more unseen roads to dare\u2026\u201D\r\nHe liked to think of himself as a seasoned traveler, though as far as Szeth could tell, he just moved around in a wide circle. There were many small mines\u2014and therefore small villages\u2014in this part of Bavland. Took had probably been to this same village years back, but the mines made for a lot of transient workers. It was unlikely he\u2019d be remembered, unless someone had noted his terribly exaggerated stories.\r\nTerrible or not, the other miners seemed to thirst for more. They urged him on, offering him another drink, and he modestly agreed.\r\nSzeth sat quietly, legs folded, hands in his lap, blood trickling down his arm. Had the Parshendi known what they were consigning him to by tossing his Oathstone away as they fled Kholinar that night? Szeth had been required to recover it, then stand there beside the road, wondering if he would be discovered and executed\u2014\r\nhopinghe\u2019d be discovered and executed\u2014until a passing merchant had cared enough to inquire. By then, Szeth had stood only in a loincloth. His honor had forced him to discard the white clothing, as it would have made him easier to recognize. He had to preserve himself so that he could suffer.\r\nAfter a short explanation that left out incriminating details, Szeth had found himself riding in the back of the merchant\u2019s cart. The merchant\u2014a man named Avado\u2014had been clever enough to realize that in the wake of the king\u2019s death, foreigners might be treated poorly. He\u2019d made his way to Jah Keved, never knowing that he harbored Gavilar\u2019s murderer as his serving man.\r\nThe Alethi didn\u2019t search for him. They assumed that he, the infamous \u201CAssassin in White,\u201D had retreated with the Parshendi. They probably expected to discover him in the middle of the Shattered Plains.\r\nThe miners eventually tired of Took\u2019s increasingly slurred stories. They bid him farewell, ignoring his broad hints that another cup of beer would prompt him to tell his greatest tale: that of the time when he\u2019d seen the Nightwatcher herself and stolen a sphere that glowed black at night. That tale always discomforted Szeth, as it reminded him of the strange black sphere Gavilar had given him. He\u2019d hidden that carefully in Jah Keved. He didn\u2019t know what it was, but he didn\u2019t want to risk a master taking it from him.\r\nWhen nobody offered Took another drink, he reluctantly stumbled from his chair and waved Szeth to follow him from the tavern. The street was dark outside. This town, Ironsway, had a proper town square, several hundred homes, and three different taverns. That made it practically a metropolis for Bavland\u2014the small, mostly-ignored stretch of land just south of the Horneater Peaks. The area was technically part of Jah Keved, but even its highprince tended to stay away from it.\r\nSzeth followed his master through the streets toward the poorer district. Took was too cheap to pay for a room in the nice, or even modest, areas of a town. Szeth looked over his shoulder, wishing that the Second Sister\u2014known as Nomon to these Easterners\u2014had risen to give a little more light.\r\nTook stumbled drunkenly, then fell over in the street. Szeth sighed. It would not be the first night he carried his master home to his bed. He knelt to lift Took.\r\nHe froze. A warm liquid was pooling beneath his master\u2019s body. Only then did he notice the knife in Took\u2019s neck.\r\nSzeth instantly came alert as a group of footpads slipped out of the alleyway. One raised a hand, the knife in it reflecting starlight, preparing to throw at Szeth. He tensed. There were infused spheres he could draw upon in Took\u2019s pouch.\r\n\u201CWait,\u201D hissed one of the footpads.\r\nThe man with the knife paused. Another man came closer, inspecting Szeth. \u201CHe\u2019s Shin. Won\u2019t hurt a cremling.\u201D\r\nOthers pulled the corpse into the alleyway. The one with the knife raised his weapon again. \u201CHe could still yell.\u201D\r\n\u201CThen why hasn\u2019t he? Oi\u2019m telling you, they\u2019re harmless. Almost like parshmen. We can sell him.\u201D\r\n\u201CMaybe,\u201D the second said. \u201CHe\u2019s terrified. Look at \u2019im.\u201D\r\n\u201CCome \u2019ere,\u201D the first footpad said, waving Szeth forward.\r\nHe obeyed, walking into the alley, which was suddenly illuminated as the other footpads pulled open Took\u2019s pouch.\r\n\u201CKelek,\u201D one of them said, \u201Chardly worth the effort. A handful of chips and two marks, not a single broam in the lot.\u201D\r\n\u201COi\u2019m telling you,\u201D the first man said. \u201CWe can sell this fellow as a slave. People like Shin servants.\u201D\r\n\u201CHe\u2019s just a kid.\u201D\r\n\u201CNah. They all look like that. Hey, whacha got there?\u201D The man plucked a twinkling, sphere-sized chunk of rock from the hand of the man counting the spheres. It was fairly ordinary, a simple piece of rock with a few quartz crystals set into it and a rusty vein of iron on one side. \u201CWhat is this?\u201D\r\n\u201CWorthless,\u201D one of the men said.\r\n\u201CI am required to tell you,\u201D Szeth said quietly, \u201Cthat you are holding my Oathstone. So long as you possess it, you are my master.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat\u2019s that?\u201D one of the footpads said, standing.\r\nThe first one closed his hand around the stone, shooting a wary glance at the others. He looked back at Szeth. \u201CYour master? What does that mean exactly, in precise terms and all?\u201D\r\n\u201CI must obey you,\u201D Szeth said. \u201CIn all things, though I will not follow an order to kill myself.\u201D He also couldn\u2019t be ordered to give up his Blade, but there was no need to mention that at the moment.\r\n\u201CYou\u2019ll obey me?\u201D the footpad said. \u201CYou mean, you\u2019ll do what Oi say?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes.\u201D\r\n\u201C\r\nAnythingOi say?\u201D\r\nSzeth closed his eyes. \u201CYes.\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, ain\u2019t that something interestin\u2019,\u201D the man said, musing. \u201CSomething interestin\u2019 indeed\u2026.\u201D"

      "ChapterName": "12: UNITY",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\nOld friend, I hope this missive finds you well. Though, as you are now essentially immortal, I would guess that wellness on your part is something of a given.\r\n\u201CToday,\u201D King Elhokar announced, riding beneath the bright open sky, \u201Cis an excellent day to slay a god. Wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201D\r\n\u201CUndoubtedly, Your Majesty.\u201D Sadeas\u2019s reply was smooth, quick, and said with a knowing smile. \u201COne might say that gods, as a rule, should fear the Alethi nobility. Most of us at least.\u201D\r\nAdolin gripped his reins a little more tightly; it put him on edge every time Highprince Sadeas spoke.\r\n\u201CDo we have to ride up here at the front?\u201D Renarin whispered.\r\n\u201CI want to listen,\u201D Adolin replied softly.\r\nHe and his brother rode near the front of the column, near the king and his highprinces. Behind them extended a grand procession: a thousand soldiers in Kholin blue, dozens of servants, and even women in palanquins to scribe accounts of the hunt. Adolin glanced at them all as he reached for his canteen.\r\nHe was wearing his Shardplate, and so he had to be careful when grabbing it, lest he crush it. One\u2019s muscles reacted with increased speed, strength, and dexterity when wearing the armor, and it took practice to use it correctly. Adolin was still occasionally caught by surprise, though he\u2019d held this suit\u2014inherited from his mother\u2019s side of the family\u2014since his sixteenth birthday. That was now seven years past.\r\nHe turned and took a long drink of lukewarm water. Sadeas rode to the king\u2019s left, and Dalinar\u2014Adolin\u2019s father\u2014was a solid figure riding at the king\u2019s right. The final highprince on the hunt was Vamah, who wasn\u2019t a Shardbearer.\r\nThe king was resplendent in his golden Shardplate\u2014of course, Plate could make any man look regal. Even\r\nSadeaslooked impressive when wearing his red Plate, though his bulbous face and ruddy complexion weakened the effect. Sadeas and the king flaunted their Plate. And\u2026well, perhaps Adolin did too. He\u2019d had his painted blue, a few ornamentations welded onto the helm and pauldrons to give an extra look of danger. How could you\r\nnotshow off when wearing something as grand as Shardplate?\r\nAdolin took another drink, listening to the king talk about his excitement for the hunt. Only one Shardbearer in the procession\u2014indeed, only one Shardbearer in the entirety of the ten armies\u2014used no paint or ornamentations on his Plate. Dalinar Kholin. Adolin\u2019s father preferred to leave his armor its natural slate-grey color.\r\nDalinar rode beside the king, his face somber. He rode with his helm tied to his saddle, exposing a square face topped by short black hair that had gone white at the temples. Few women had ever called Dalinar Kholin handsome; his nose was the wrong shape, his features blocky rather than delicate. It was the face of a warrior.\r\nHe rode astride a massive black Ryshadium stallion, one of the largest horses that Adolin had ever seen\u2014and while the king and Sadeas looked regal in their armor, somehow Dalinar managed to look like a soldier. To him, the Plate was not an ornament. It was a tool. He never seemed to be surprised by the strength or speed the armor lent him. It was as if, for Dalinar Kholin, wearing his Plate was his natural state\u2014it was the times without that were abnormal. Perhaps that was one reason he\u2019d earned the reputation of being one of the greatest warriors and generals who ever lived.\r\nAdolin found himself wishing, passionately, that his father would do a little more these days to live up to that reputation.\r\nHe\u2019s thinking about the visions,Adolin thought, regarding his father\u2019s distant expression and troubled eyes. \u201CIt happened again last night,\u201D Adolin said softly to Renarin. \u201CDuring the highstorm.\u201D\r\n\u201CI know,\u201D Renarin said. His voice was measured, controlled. He always paused before he replied to a question, as if testing the words in his mind. Some women Adolin knew said Renarin\u2019s ways made them feel as if he were dissecting them with his mind. They\u2019d shiver when they spoke of him, though Adolin had never found his younger brother the least bit discomforting.\r\n\u201CWhat do you think they mean?\u201D Adolin asked, speaking quietly so only Renarin could hear. \u201CFather\u2019s\u2026episodes.\u201D\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know.\u201D\r\n\u201CRenarin, we\r\ncan\u2019tkeep ignoring them. The soldiers are talking. Rumors are spreading through all ten armies!\u201D\r\nDalinar Kholin was going mad. Whenever a highstorm came, he fell to the floor and began to shake. Then he began raving in gibberish. Often, he\u2019d stand, blue eyes delusional and wild, swinging and flailing. Adolin had to restrain him lest he hurt himself or others.\r\n\u201CHe sees things,\u201D Adolin said. \u201COr he thinks he does.\u201D\r\nAdolin\u2019s grandfather had suffered from delusions. When he\u2019d grown old, he\u2019d thought he was back at war. Was that what happened to Dalinar? Was he reliving youthful battles, days when he\u2019d earned his renown? Or was it that terrible night he saw over and over, the night when his brother had been murdered by the Assassin in White? And why did he so often mention the Knights Radiant soon after his episodes?\r\nIt all made Adolin feel sick. Dalinar was the Blackthorn, a genius of the battlefield and a living legend. Together, he and his brother had reunited Alethkar\u2019s warring highprinces after centuries of strife. He had defeated countless challengers in duels, had won dozens of battles. The entire kingdom looked up to him. And now this.\r\nWhat did you do, as a son, when the man you loved\u2014the greatest man alive\u2014started to lose his wits?\r\nSadeas was speaking about a recent victory. He\u2019d won another gemheart two days back, and the king\u2014it appeared\u2014hadn\u2019t heard of it. Adolin tensed at the boasts.\r\n\u201CWe should move back,\u201D Renarin said.\r\n\u201CWe are of rank enough to be here,\u201D Adolin said.\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t like how you get when you\u2019re around Sadeas.\u201D\r\nWe have to keep an eye on the man, Renarin,Adolin thought.\r\nHe knows Father is weakening. He\u2019ll try to strike.Adolin forced himself to smile, however. He tried to be relaxed and confident for Renarin. Generally, that wasn\u2019t difficult. He\u2019d happily spend his entire life dueling, lounging, and courting the occasional pretty girl. Of late, however, life didn\u2019t seem content to let him enjoy its simple pleasures.\r\n\u201C\u2026model of courage lately, Sadeas,\u201D the king was saying. \u201CYou\u2019ve done very well in capturing gemhearts. You are to be commended.\u201D\r\n\u201CThank you, Your Majesty. Though the competition grows unexciting, as some people don\u2019t seem interested in participating. I guess even the best weapons eventually grow dull.\u201D\r\nDalinar, who might once have responded to the veiled slur, said nothing. Adolin gritted his teeth. It was flat-out unconscionable for Sadeas to be taking shots at his father in his present state. Perhaps Adolin should offer the pompous bastard a challenge. You didn\u2019t duel highprinces\u2014it just wasn\u2019t done, not unless you were ready to make a big storm of it. But maybe he was. Maybe\u2014\r\n\u201CAdolin\u2026\u201D Renarin said warningly.\r\nAdolin looked to the side. He\u2019d held out his hand, as if to summon his Blade. He picked up his reins with the hand instead.\r\nStorming man,he thought.\r\nLeave my father alone.\r\n\u201CWhy don\u2019t we talk about the hunt?\u201D Renarin said. As usual, the younger Kholin rode with a straight back and perfect posture, eyes hidden behind his spectacles, a model of propriety and solemnity. \u201CAren\u2019t you excited?\u201D\r\n\u201CBah,\u201D Adolin said. \u201CI never find hunts as interesting as everyone says they\u2019re going to be. I don\u2019t care how big the beast is\u2014in the end, it\u2019s really just butchery.\u201D\r\nNow, dueling,\r\nthatwas exciting. The feel of the Shardblade in your hand, of facing someone crafty, skilled, and careful. Man against man, strength against strength, mind against mind. Hunting some dumb beast just couldn\u2019t compare to that.\r\n\u201CMaybe you should have invited Janala along,\u201D Renarin said.\r\n\u201CShe wouldn\u2019t have come,\u201D Adolin said. \u201CNot after\u2026well, you know. Rilla was very vocal yesterday. It was best to just leave.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou really should have been wiser in your treatment of her,\u201D Renarin said, sounding disapproving.\r\nAdolin mumbled a noncommittal reply. It wasn\u2019t\r\nhisfault that his relationships often burned out quickly. Well, technically, this time it\r\nwashis fault. But it wasn\u2019t usually. This was just an oddity\r\nThe king began complaining about something. Renarin and Adolin had lagged behind, and Adolin couldn\u2019t hear what was being said.\r\n\u201CLet\u2019s ride up closer,\u201D Adolin said, nudging his mount forward.\r\nRenarin rolled his eyes, but followed.\r\nUnite them.\r\nThe words whispered in Dalinar\u2019s mind. He couldn\u2019t rid himself of them. They consumed him as he trotted Gallant across a rocky, boulder-strewn plateau on the Shattered Plains.\r\n\u201CShouldn\u2019t we be there by now?\u201D the king asked.\r\n\u201CWe\u2019re still two or three plateaus away from the hunting site, Your Majesty,\u201D Dalinar said, distracted. \u201CIt will be another hour, perhaps, observing proper protocols. If we had vantage, we could probably see the pavilion to\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CVantage? Would that rock formation up ahead do?\u201D\r\n\u201CI suppose,\u201D Dalinar said, inspecting the towerlike length of rock. \u201CWe could send scouts to check.\u201D\r\n\u201CScouts? Bah. I need a run, Uncle. I\u2019ll bet you five full broams that I can beat you to the top.\u201D And with that, the king galloped away in a thunder of hooves, leaving behind a shocked group of lighteyes, attendants, and guards.\r\n\u201CStorm it!\u201D Dalinar cursed, kicking his horse into motion. \u201CAdolin, you have command! Secure the next plateau, just in case.\u201D\r\nHis son, who had been lagging behind, nodded sharply. Dalinar galloped after the king, a figure in golden armor and a long blue cape. Hoofbeats pounded the stone, rock formations whipping past. Ahead, the steep, spike-like spire of rock rose from the lip of the plateau. Such formations were common out here on the Shattered Plains.\r\nCurse that boy.Dalinar still thought of Elhokar as a boy, though the king was in his twenty-seventh year. But sometimes he acted like a boy. Why couldn\u2019t he give more warning before leaping into one of these stunts?\r\nStill, as Dalinar rode, he admitted to himself that it\r\ndidfeel good to charge freely, helm off, face to the wind. His pulse picked up as he got into the race, and he forgave its impetuous beginning. For the moment, Dalinar let himself forget his troubles and the words that had been echoing in his head.\r\nThe king wanted a race? Well, Dalinar would give him one.\r\nHe charged past the king. Elhokar\u2019s stallion was a good breed, but it could never match Gallant, who was a full Ryshadium, two hands taller and much stronger than an ordinary horse. The animals chose their own riders, and only a dozen men in all of the warcamps were so fortunate. Dalinar was one, Adolin another.\r\nIn seconds, Dalinar reached the formation\u2019s base. He threw himself from the saddle while Gallant was still moving. He hit hard, but the Shardplate absorbed the impact, stone crunching beneath his metal boots as he skidded to a stop. Men who hadn\u2019t ever worn Plate\u2014particularly those who were accustomed to its inferior cousin, simple plate and mail\u2014could never understand. Shardplate wasn\u2019t merely armor. It was so much more.\r\nHe ran to the bottom of the rock formation as Elhokar galloped up behind. Dalinar leaped\u2014Plate-assisted legs propelling him up some eight feet\u2014and grabbed a handhold in the stone. With a heave, he pulled himself up, the Plate lending him the strength of many men. The Thrill of contest began to rise within him. It wasn\u2019t nearly as keen as the Thrill of battle, but it was a worthy substitute.\r\nRock scraped below. Elhokar had begun to climb as well. Dalinar didn\u2019t look down. He kept his eyes fixed on the small natural platform at the top of the forty-foot-high formation. He groped with steel-covered fingers, finding another handhold. The gauntlets covered his hands, but the ancient armor somehow transferred sensation to his fingers. It was as if he were wearing thin leather gloves.\r\nA scraping sound came from the right, accompanied by a voice cursing softly. Elhokar had taken a different path, hoping to pass Dalinar, but the king had found himself at a section without handholds above. His progress was stalled.\r\nThe king\u2019s golden Shardplate glittered as he glanced at Dalinar. Elhokar set his jaw and looked upward, then launched himself in a powerful leap toward an outcropping.\r\nFool boy,Dalinar thought, watching the king seem to hang in the air for a moment before he snatched the projecting rock and dangled. Then the king pulled himself up and continued to climb.\r\nDalinar moved furiously, stone grinding beneath his metal fingertips, chips falling free. The wind ruffled his cape. He heaved, strained, and pushed himself, managing to get just ahead of the king. The top was mere feet away. The Thrill sang at him. He reached for the goal, determined to win. He couldn\u2019t lose. He had to\u2014\r\nUnite them.\r\nHe hesitated, not quite certain why, and let his nephew get ahead.\r\nElhokar hauled himself to his feet atop the rock formation, then laughed in triumph. He turned toward Dalinar, holding out a hand. \u201CStormwinds, Uncle, but you made a fine race of it! At the end there, I thought for sure you had me.\u201D\r\nThe triumph and joy in Elhokar\u2019s face brought a smile to Dalinar\u2019s lips. The younger man needed victories these days. Even little ones would do him good. Gloryspren\u2014like tiny golden translucent globes of light\u2014began to pop into existence around him, attracted by his sense of accomplishment. Blessing himself for hesitating, Dalinar took the king\u2019s hand, letting Elhokar pull him up. There was just enough room on top of the natural tower for them both.\r\nBreathing deeply, Dalinar slapped the king on the back with a clank of metal on metal. \u201CThat\r\nwasa fine contest, Your Majesty. And you played it very well.\u201D\r\nThe king beamed. His golden Shardplate gleamed in the noonday sun; he had his faceplate up, revealing light yellow eyes, a strong nose, and a clean-shaven face that was almost too handsome, with its full lips, broad forehead, and firm chin. Gavilar had looked like that too, before he\u2019d suffered a broken nose and that terrible scar on his chin.\r\nBelow them, the Cobalt Guard and some of Elhokar\u2019s attendants rode up, including Sadeas. His Plate gleamed red, though he wasn\u2019t a full Shardbearer\u2014he had only the Plate, not the Blade.\r\nDalinar looked up. From this height, he could scan a large swath of the Shattered Plains, and he had an odd moment of familiarity. He felt as if he\u2019d been atop this vantage point before, looking down at a broken landscape.\r\nThe moment was gone in a heartbeat.\r\n\u201CThere,\u201D Elhokar said, pointing with a golden, gauntleted hand. \u201CI can see our destination.\u201D\r\nDalinar shaded his eyes, picking out a large cloth pavilion three plateaus away, flying the king\u2019s flag. Wide, permanent bridges led there; they were relatively close to the Alethi side of the Shattered Plains, on plateaus Dalinar himself maintained. A fully grown chasmfiend living here was his to hunt, the wealth at its heart his privilege to claim.\r\n\u201CYou were correct again, Uncle,\u201D Elhokar said.\r\n\u201CI try to make a habit of it.\u201D\r\n\u201CI can\u2019t blame you for that, I suppose. Though I can beat you at a race now and then.\u201D\r\nDalinar smiled. \u201CI felt like a youth again, chasing after your father on some ridiculous challenge.\u201D\r\nElhokar\u2019s lips tightened to a thin line, and the gloryspren faded away. Mentioning Gavilar soured him; he felt others compared him unfavorably to the old king. Unfortunately, he was often right.\r\nDalinar moved on quickly. \u201CWe must have seemed of the ten fools, charging away like that. I do wish you\u2019d given me more notice to prepare your honor guard. This\r\nisa war zone.\u201D\r\n\u201CBah. You worry too much, Uncle. The Parshendi haven\u2019t attacked this close to our side of the Plains in years.\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, you seemed worried about your safety two nights ago.\u201D\r\nElhokar sighed audibly. \u201CHow many times must I explain this to you, Uncle? I can face enemy soldiers with Blade in hand. It\u2019s what they might send when we\u2019re not looking, when all is dark and quiet, that you should be trying to protect me from.\u201D\r\nDalinar didn\u2019t reply. Elhokar\u2019s nervousness\u2014paranoia, even\u2014regarding assassination was strong. But who could blame him, considering what had happened to his father?\r\nI\u2019m sorry, brother,he thought, as he did every time he thought of the night when Gavilar had died. Alone, without his brother to protect him.\r\n\u201CI looked into the matter you asked me about,\u201D Dalinar said, forcing away bad memories.\r\n\u201CYou did? What did you discover?\u201D\r\n\u201CNot much, I\u2019m afraid. There were no traces of trespassers on your balcony, and none of the servants reported any strangers in the area.\u201D\r\n\u201CThere\r\nwassomeone watching me in the darkness that night.\u201D\r\n\u201CIf so, they haven\u2019t returned, Your Majesty. And they left no clues behind.\u201D\r\nElhokar seemed dissatisfied, and the silence between them grew stark. Below, Adolin met with scouts and prepared for the troop crossing. Elhokar had protested at how many men Dalinar had brought. Most of them wouldn\u2019t be needed on the hunt\u2014the Shardbearers, not the soldiers, would slay the beast. But Dalinar\r\nwouldsee his nephew protected. Parshendi raids had grown less bold during the years of fighting\u2014Alethi scribes guessed their numbers were a quarter their prior strength, though it was difficult to judge\u2014but the king\u2019s presence might be enough to entice them into a reckless attack.\r\nThe winds blew across Dalinar, returning with them that faint familiarity he\u2019d felt a few minutes before. Standing atop a peak, looking out at desolation. A sense of an awful and amazing perspective.\r\nThat\u2019s it,he thought.\r\nIdid\r\nstand atop a formation like this. It happened during\u2014\r\nDuring one of his visions. The very first one.\r\nYou must unite them,the strange, booming words had told him.\r\nYou must prepare. Build of your people a fortress of strength and peace, a wall to resist the winds. Cease squabbling and unite. The Everstorm comes.\r\n\u201CYour Majesty,\u201D Dalinar found himself saying. \u201CI\u2026\u201D He trailed off as quickly as he began. What could he say? That he\u2019d been seeing visions? That\u2014in defiance of all doctrine and common sense\u2014he thought those visions might be from the Almighty? That he thought they should withdraw from the battlefield and go back to Alethkar?\r\nPure foolishness.\r\n\u201CUncle?\u201D the king asked. \u201CWhat do you want?\u201D\r\n\u201CNothing. Come, let\u2019s get back to the others.\u201D\r\nAdolin twisted one of his hogshide reins around his finger while he sat astride his horse, awaiting the next batch of scout reports. He\u2019d managed to get his mind off his father and Sadeas, and was instead contemplating just how he was going to explain his falling out with Rilla in a way that would earn him some sympathy with Janala.\r\nJanala loved ancient epic poems; could he phrase the falling out in dramatic terms? He smiled, thinking of her luxurious black hair and sly smile. She\u2019d been daring, teasing at him while he was known to be courting someone else. He could use that too. Maybe Renarin was right, perhaps he should have invited her on the hunt. The prospect of fighting a greatshell would have been far more interesting to him if someone beautiful and long-haired were watching\u2026.\r\n\u201CNew scout reports are in, Brightlord Adolin,\u201D Tarilar said, jogging up.\r\nAdolin turned his mind back to business. He\u2019d taken up position with some members of the Cobalt Guard beside the base of the high rock formation where his father and the king were still conversing. Tarilar, scoutlord, was a gaunt-faced man with a thick chest and arms. From some angles, his head looked so relatively small on his body that it appeared to have been smashed.\r\n\u201CProceed,\u201D Adolin said.\r\n\u201CAdvance runners have met with the lead huntmaster and have returned. There are no sightings of Parshendi on any nearby plateaus. Companies Eighteen and Twenty-one are in position, though there are still eight companies to go.\u201D\r\nAdolin nodded. \u201CHave Company Twenty-one send some outriders to watch from plateaus fourteen and sixteen. And two each on plateaus six and eight.\u201D\r\n\u201CSix and eight? Behind us?\u201D\r\n\u201CIf I were going to ambush the party,\u201D Adolin said, \u201CI\u2019d round back this way and cut us off from fleeing. Do it.\u201D\r\nTarilar saluted. \u201CYes, Brightlord.\u201D He hurried away to pass the orders.\r\n\u201CYou really think that\u2019s necessary?\u201D Renarin asked, riding up beside Adolin.\r\n\u201CNo. But Father will want it done anyway. You know he will.\u201D\r\nThere was motion up above. Adolin looked up just in time to see the king leap off the rock formation, cape streaming behind him as he fell some forty feet to the rock floor. Adolin\u2019s father stood at the lip above, and Adolin could imagine him cursing to himself at what he saw as a foolhardy move. Shardplate could withstand a fall that far, but it was high enough to be dangerous.\r\nElhokar landed with an audible crack, throwing up chips of stone and a large puff of Stormlight. He managed to stay upright. Adolin\u2019s father took a safer way down, descending to a lower ledge before jumping.\r\nHe seems to take the safer pathway more and more often lately,Adolin thought idly.\r\nAnd he often seems to find reasons to give me command as well.Thoughtful, Adolin trotted his horse out of the shadow of the rock formation. He needed to get a report from the rear guard\u2014his father would want to hear it.\r\nHis path took him past a group of lighteyes from Sadeas\u2019s party. The king, Sadeas, and Vamah each had a collection of attendants, aides, and sycophants accompanying them. Looking at them riding in their comfortable silks, open-fronted jackets, and shade-covered palanquins made Adolin aware of his sweaty, bulky armor. Shardplate was wonderful and empowering, but beneath a hot sun, it could still leave a man wishing for something less confining.\r\nBut, of course, he couldn\u2019t have worn casual clothing like the others. Adolin was to be in uniform, even on a hunt. The Alethi War Codes commanded it. Never mind that nobody had followed those Codes in centuries. Or at least nobody but Dalinar Kholin\u2014and, by extension, his sons.\r\nAdolin passed a pair of lounging lighteyes, Vartian and Lomard, two of Sadeas\u2019s recent hangers-on. They were talking loudly enough that Adolin could hear. Probably on purpose. \u201CChasing after the king again,\u201D Vartian said, shaking his head. \u201CLike pet axehounds nipping at their master\u2019s heels.\u201D\r\n\u201CShameful,\u201D Lomard said. \u201CHow long has it been since Dalinar won a gemheart? The only time he can get one is when the king lets them hunt it without competition.\u201D\r\nAdolin set his jaw and rode on. His father\u2019s interpretation of the Codes wouldn\u2019t let Adolin challenge a man to a duel while he was on duty or in command. He chafed at the needless restrictions, but Dalinar had spoken as Adolin\u2019s commanding officer. That meant there was no room for argument. He\u2019d have to find a way to duel the two idiot sycophants in another setting, put them in their places. Unfortunately, he couldn\u2019t duel everyone who spoke out against his father.\r\nThe biggest problem was, the things they said had some real truth to them. The Alethi princedoms were like kingdoms unto themselves, still mostly autonomous despite having accepted Gavilar as king. Elhokar had inherited the throne, and Dalinar, by right, had taken the Kholin Princedom as his own.\r\nHowever, most of the highprinces gave only token nods to the paramount rule of the king. That left Elhokar without land that was specifically his own. He tended to act like a highprince of the Kholin Princedom, taking great interest in its day-to-day management. So, while Dalinar should have been a ruler unto himself, he instead bent to Elhokar\u2019s whims and dedicated his resources to protecting his nephew. That made him weak in the eyes of the others\u2014nothing more than a glorified bodyguard.\r\nOnce, when Dalinar had been feared, men had not dared whisper about these things. But now? Dalinar went on fewer and fewer plateau assaults, and his forces lagged behind in capturing precious gemhearts. While the others fought and won, Dalinar and his sons spent their time in bureaucratic administration.\r\nAdolin wanted to be out there fighting, killing Parshendi. What was the good of following the Codes of War when he rarely got to\r\ngoto war?\r\nIt\u2019s the fault of those delusions.Dalinar wasn\u2019t weak, and he certainly wasn\u2019t a coward, no matter what people said. He was just troubled.\r\nThe rearguard captains weren\u2019t formed up yet, so Adolin decided to give the king a report instead. He trotted up toward the king\u2014joining Sadeas, who was doing the same. Not unexpectedly, Sadeas frowned at him. The highprince hated that Adolin had a Blade while Sadeas had none; he had coveted one for years now.\r\nAdolin met the highprince\u2019s eyes, smiling.\r\nAnytime you want to duel me for my Blade, Sadeas, go ahead and try.What Adolin wouldn\u2019t do to get that eel of a man in the dueling ring.\r\nWhen Dalinar and the king rode up, and Adolin spoke quickly, before Sadeas could speak. \u201CYour Majesty, I have scout reports.\u201D\r\nThe king sighed. \u201CMore of nothing, I expect. Honestly, Uncle, must we have a report on every little detail of the army?\u201D\r\n\u201CWe are at war, Your Majesty,\u201D Dalinar said.\r\nElhokar sighed sufferingly.\r\nYou\u2019re a strange man, cousin,Adolin thought. Elhokar saw murderers in every shadow, yet often dismissed the Parshendi threat. He\u2019d go charging off like he had today, with no honor guard, and would leap off a forty-foot-tall rock formation. Yet he\u2019d stay up nights, terrified of assassination.\r\n\u201CGive your report, son,\u201D Dalinar said.\r\nAdolin hesitated, now feeling foolish at the lack of substance to what he had to say. \u201CThe scouts have seen no sign of the Parshendi. They\u2019ve met with the huntmaster. Two companies have secured the next plateau, and the other eight will need some time to cross. We\u2019re close, though.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes, we saw from above,\u201D Elhokar said. \u201CPerhaps a few of us could ride ahead\u2026.\u201D\r\n\u201CYour Majesty,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CThe point of bringing my troops along would be somewhat undermined if you left them behind.\u201D\r\nElhokar rolled his eyes. Dalinar did not yield, his expression as immobile as the rocks around them. Seeing him like that\u2014firm, unyielding before a challenge\u2014made Adolin smile with pride. Why couldn\u2019t he be like this\r\nallof the time? Why did he back down so often before insults or challenges?\r\n\u201CVery well,\u201D the king said. \u201CWe\u2019ll take a break and wait while the army crosses.\u201D\r\nThe king\u2019s attendants responded immediately, men climbing off horses, women having their palanquin bearers set them down. Adolin moved off to get that rearguard report. By the time he returned, Elhokar was practically holding court. His servants had set up a small awning to give him shade, and others served wine. Chilled, using one of the new fabrials that could make things cold.\r\nAdolin removed his helm and wiped his brow with his saddle rag, again wishing he could join the others and enjoy a little wine. Instead, he climbed down from his horse and went looking for his father. Dalinar stood outside the awning, gauntleted hands clasped behind his back, looking eastward, toward the Origin\u2014the distant, the unseen place where highstorms began. Renarin stood at his side, looking out as well, as if trying to see what it was that his father found so interesting.\r\nAdolin rested a hand on his brother\u2019s shoulder, and Renarin smiled at him. Adolin knew that his brother\u2014now nineteen years old\u2014felt out of place. Though he wore a side sword, he barely knew how to use it. His blood weakness made it difficult for him to spend any reasonable amount of time practicing.\r\n\u201CFather,\u201D Adolin said. \u201CMaybe the king was right. Perhaps we should have moved on quickly. I\u2019d rather have this entire hunt over with.\u201D\r\nDalinar looked at him. \u201CWhen I was your age, I looked forward to a hunt like this. Taking down a greatshell was the highlight of a young man\u2019s year.\u201D\r\nNot this again,Adolin thought. Why was everyone so offended that he didn\u2019t find hunts exciting? \u201CIt\u2019s just an oversized chull, Father.\u201D\r\n\u201CThese \u2018oversized chulls\u2019 grow to fifty feet tall and are capable of crushing even a man in Shardplate.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D Adolin said, \u201Cand so we\u2019ll bait it for hours while baking in the hot sun. If it decides to show up, we\u2019ll pelt it with arrows, only closing in once it\u2019s so weak it can barely resist as we hack it to death with Shardblades. Very honorable.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s not a duel,\u201D Dalinar said, \u201Cit\u2019s a hunt. A grand tradition.\u201D\r\nAdolin raised an eyebrow at him.\r\n\u201CAnd yes,\u201D Dalinar added. \u201CIt can be tedious. But the king was insistent.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou\u2019re just still smarting over the problems with Rilla, Adolin,\u201D Renarin said. \u201CYou were eager a week ago. You really should have invited Janala.\u201D\r\n\u201CJanala hates hunts. Thinks they\u2019re barbarous.\u201D\r\nDalinar frowned. \u201CJanala? Who\u2019s Janala?\u201D\r\n\u201CDaughter of Brightlord Lustow,\u201D Adolin said.\r\n\u201CAnd you\u2019re courting her?\u201D\r\n\u201CNot yet, but I\u2019ve sure been trying.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat happened to that other girl? The short one, with the fondness for silver hair ribbons?\u201D\r\n\u201CDeeli?\u201D Adolin said. \u201CFather, I stopped courting her over two months back!\u201D\r\n\u201CYou did?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes.\u201D\r\nDalinar rubbed his chin.\r\n\u201CThere have been two between her and Janala, Father,\u201D Adolin noted. \u201CYou really need to pay more attention.\u201D\r\n\u201CAlmighty help any man who tries to keep track of your tangled courtships, son.\u201D\r\n\u201CThe most recent was Rilla,\u201D Renarin said.\r\nDalinar frowned. \u201CAnd you two\u2026\u201D\r\n\u201CHad some problems yesterday,\u201D Adolin said. He coughed, determined to change the subject. \u201CAnyway, don\u2019t you find it odd that the king would insist on coming to hunt the chasmfiend himself?\u201D\r\n\u201CNot particularly. It isn\u2019t often that a full-sized one makes its way out here, and the king rarely gets to go on plateau runs. This is a way for him to fight.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut he\u2019s so paranoid! Why does he now want to go and hunt, exposing himself on the Plains?\u201D\r\nDalinar looked toward the king\u2019s awning. \u201CI know he seems odd, son. But the king is more complex a man than many give him credit for being. He worries that his subjects see him as a coward because of how much he fears assassins, and so he finds ways to prove his courage. Foolish ways, sometimes\u2014but he\u2019s not the first man I\u2019ve known who will face battle without fear, yet cower in terror about knives in the shadows. The hallmark of insecurity is bravado.\r\n\u201CThe king is learning to lead. He needs this hunt. He needs to prove to himself, and to others, that he\u2019s still strong and worthy to command a kingdom at war. That\u2019s why I encouraged him. A successful hunt, under controlled circumstances, could bolster his reputation and his confidence.\u201D\r\nAdolin slowly closed his mouth, his father\u2019s words cutting down his complaints. Strange, how much the king\u2019s actions made sense when explained that way. Adolin looked up at his father.\r\nHow can the others whisper that he\u2019s a coward? Can\u2019t they see his wisdom?\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D Dalinar said, eyes growing distant. \u201CYour nephew is a better man than many think him, and a stronger king. At least he could be. I just have to figure out how to persuade him to leave the Shattered Plains.\u201D\r\nAdolin started. \u201C\r\nWhat?\u201D\r\n\u201CI didn\u2019t understand at first,\u201D Dalinar continued. \u201CUnite them. I\u2019m supposed to unite them. But aren\u2019t they already united? We fight together here on the Shattered Plains. We have a common enemy in the Parshendi. I\u2019m beginning to see that we\u2019re united only in name. The highprinces give lip service to Elhokar, but this war\u2014this siege\u2014is a game to them. A competition against one another.\r\n\u201CWe can\u2019t unite them here. We need to return to Alethkar and stabilize our homeland, learn how to work together as one nation. The Shattered Plains divide us. The others worry too much about winning wealth and prestige.\u201D\r\n\u201CWealth and prestige are what being Alethi is\r\nabout, Father!\u201D Adolin said. Was he really hearing this? \u201CWhat of the Vengeance Pact? The highprinces vowed to seek retribution upon the Parshendi!\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd we\r\nhavesought it.\u201D Dalinar looked to Adolin. \u201CI realize that it sounds terrible, son, but some things are more important than vengeance. I loved Gavilar. I miss him fiercely, and I hate the Parshendi for what they did. But Gavilar\u2019s life work was to unite Alethkar, and I\u2019ll go to Damnation before I let it break apart.\u201D\r\n\u201CFather,\u201D Adolin said, feeling pained, \u201Cif there\u2019s something wrong here, it\u2019s that we\u2019re not trying hard enough. You think the highprinces are playing games? Well, show them the way it should be done! Instead of talking of retreat, we should be talking of advancing, striking at the Parshendi instead of besieging them.\u201D\r\n\u201CPerhaps.\u201D\r\n\u201CEither way, we cannot speak of withdrawing,\u201D Adolin said. The men\r\nalreadytalked of Dalinar losing his spine. What would they say if they got hold of this? \u201CYou haven\u2019t brought this up with the king, have you?\u201D\r\n\u201CNot yet. I haven\u2019t found the right way.\u201D\r\n\u201CPlease. Don\u2019t talk to him about it.\u201D\r\n\u201CWe shall see.\u201D Dalinar turned back toward the Shattered Plains, his eyes growing distant again.\r\n\u201CFather\u2026\u201D\r\n\u201CYou\u2019ve made your point, son, and I\u2019ve replied to it. Do not press the issue. Have you gotten the report from the rear guard?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat of the vanguard?\u201D\r\n\u201CI just checked with them and\u2026\u201D He trailed off. Blast. It had been long enough that it was probably time to move the king\u2019s party onward. The last of the army couldn\u2019t leave this plateau until the king was safely on the other side.\r\nAdolin sighed and went off to collect the report. Before long, they were all across the chasm and riding over the next plateau. Renarin trotted up to Adolin and tried to engage him in conversation, but Adolin gave only halfhearted replies.\r\nHe was beginning to feel an odd longing. Most of the older men in the army\u2014even those only a few years older than Adolin\u2014had fought alongside his father during the glory days. Adolin found himself jealous of all of those men who had known his father and had seen him fight when he hadn\u2019t been so wrapped up in the Codes.\r\nThe changes in Dalinar had begun with the death of his brother. That terrible day was when everything had started to go wrong. The loss of Gavilar had nearly crushed Dalinar, and Adolin would\r\nneverforgive the Parshendi for bringing his father such pain. Never. Men fought on the Plains for different reasons, but this was why Adolin had come. Perhaps if they beat the Parshendi, his father would go back to the man he had been. Perhaps those ghostly delusions that haunted him would vanish.\r\nAhead, Dalinar was speaking quietly with Sadeas. Both men wore frowns. They barely tolerated one another, though they had once been friends. That had also changed the night of Gavilar\u2019s death. What had happened between them?\r\nThe day wore on, and they eventually arrived at the hunt site\u2014a pair of plateaus, one where the creature would be lured up to attack, and another one a safe distance away for those who would watch. Like most others, these plateaus had an uneven surface inhabited by hardy plants adapted to\u00A0regular storm exposure. Rocky shelves, depressions, and uneven footing made fighting on them treacherous.\r\nAdolin joined his father, who waited beside the final bridge as the king moved over onto the viewing plateau, followed by a company of soldiers. The attendants would be next.\r\n\u201CYou\u2019re doing well with your command, son,\u201D Dalinar said, nodding to a group of soldiers at they passed and saluted.\r\n\u201CThey\u2019re good men, Father. They hardly need someone to command them during a march from plateau to plateau.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CBut you need experience leading, and they need to learn to see you as a commander.\u201D Renarin trotted up to them on his horse; it was probably time to cross to the viewing plateau. Dalinar nodded for his sons to go first.\r\nAdolin turned to go, but hesitated as he noticed something on the plateau behind them. A rider, moving quickly to catch up with the hunting party, coming from the direction of the warcamps.\r\n\u201CFather,\u201D Adolin said, pointing.\r\nDalinar turned immediately, following the gesture. However, Adolin soon recognized the newcomer. Not a messenger, as he\u2019d expected.\r\n\u201CWit!\u201D Adolin called, waving.\r\nThe newcomer trotted up to them. Tall and thin, the King\u2019s Wit rode easily on a black gelding. He wore a stiff black coat and black trousers, a color matched by his deep onyx hair. Though he wore a long, thin sword tied to his waist, as far as Adolin knew, the man had never drawn it. A dueling foil rather than a military blade, it was mostly symbolic.\r\nWit nodded to them as he approached, wearing one of those keen smiles of his. He had blue eyes, but he wasn\u2019t really a lighteyes. Nor was he a darkeyes. He was\u2026well, he was the King\u2019s Wit. That was a category all its own.\r\n\u201CAh, young Prince Adolin!\u201D Wit exclaimed. \u201CYou actually managed to pry yourself away from the camp\u2019s young women long enough to join this hunt? I\u2019m impressed.\u201D\r\nAdolin chuckled uncomfortably. \u201CWell, that\u2019s been a topic of some discussion lately\u2026.\u201D\r\nWit raised an eyebrow.\r\nAdolin sighed. Wit would find out eventually anyway\u2014it was virtually impossible to keep anything from the man. \u201CI made a lunch appointment with one woman yesterday, but I was\u2026well, I was courting another. And she\u2019s the jealous type. So now neither will speak with me.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s a constant source of amazement that you get yourself into such messes, Adolin. Each one is more exciting than the previous!\u201D\r\n\u201CEr, yes. Exciting. That\u2019s\r\nexactlyhow it feels.\u201D\r\nWit laughed again, though he maintained a sense of dignity in his posture. The King\u2019s Wit was not a silly court fool such as one might find in other kingdoms. He was a sword, a tool maintained by the king. Insulting others was beneath the dignity of the king, so just as one used gloves when forced to handle something vile, the king retained a Wit so he didn\u2019t have to debase himself to the level of rudeness or offensiveness.\r\nThis new Wit had been with them for some months, and there was something\u2026different about him. He seemed to know things that he shouldn\u2019t, important things. Useful things.\r\nWit nodded to Dalinar. \u201CYour Lordship.\u201D\r\n\u201CWit,\u201D Dalinar said stiffly.\r\n\u201CAnd young Prince Renarin!\u201D\r\nRenarin kept his eyes down.\r\n\u201CNo greeting for me, Renarin?\u201D Wit said, amused.\r\nRenarin said nothing.\r\n\u201CHe thinks you\u2019ll mock him if he speaks to you, Wit,\u201D Adolin said. \u201CEarlier this morning, he told me he\u2019d determined not to say anything around you.\u201D\r\n\u201CWonderful!\u201D Wit exclaimed. \u201CThen I can say whatever I wish, and he\u2019ll not object?\u201D\r\nRenarin hesitated.\r\nWit leaned in to Adolin. \u201CHave I told you about the night Prince Renarin and I had two days back, walking the streets of the warcamp? We came across these two sisters, you see, blue eyed and\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s a lie!\u201D Renarin said, blushing.\r\n\u201CVery well,\u201D Wit said without missing a beat, \u201CI\u2019ll confess there were actually\r\nthreesisters, but Prince Renarin quite unfairly ended up with two of them, and I didn\u2019t wish to diminish my reputation by\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CWit.\u201D Dalinar was stern as he cut in.\r\nThe black-clad man looked to him.\r\n\u201CPerhaps you should restrict your mockery to those who deserve it.\u201D\r\n\u201CBrightlord Dalinar. I believe that was what I\r\nwasdoing.\u201D\r\nDalinar\u2019s frown deepened. He never had liked Wit, and picking on Renarin was a sure way to raise his ire. Adolin could understand that, but Wit was almost always good-natured with Renarin.\r\nWit moved to leave, passing Dalinar as he did. Adolin could barely overhear what was said as Wit leaned over to whisper something. \u201CThose who \u2018deserve\u2019 my mockery are those who can benefit from it, Brightlord Dalinar. That one is less fragile than you think him.\u201D He winked, then turned his horse to move on over the bridge.\r\n\u201CStormwinds, but I like that man,\u201D Adolin said. \u201CBest Wit we\u2019ve had in ages!\u201D\r\n\u201CI find him unnerving,\u201D Renarin said softly.\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s half the fun!\u201D\r\nDalinar said nothing. The three of them crossed the bridge, passing Wit, who had stopped to torment a group of officers\u2014lighteyes of low enough rank that they needed to serve in the army and earn a wage. Several of them laughed while Wit poked fun at another.\r\nThe three of them joined the king, and were immediately approached by the day\u2019s huntmaster. Bashin was a short man with a sizable paunch; he wore rugged clothing with a leather overcoat and a wide-brimmed hat. He was a darkeyes of the first nahn, the highest and most prestigious rank a darkeyes could have, worthy even of marrying into a lighteyed family.\r\nBashin bowed to the king. \u201CYour Majesty! Wonderful timing! We\u2019ve just tossed down the bait.\u201D\r\n\u201CExcellent,\u201D Elhokar said, climbing from the saddle. Adolin and Dalinar did likewise, Shardplate clinking softly, Dalinar untying his helm from the saddle. \u201CHow long will it take?\u201D\r\n\u201CTwo or three hours is likely,\u201D Bashin said, taking the reins of the king\u2019s horse. Grooms took the two Ryshadium. \u201CWe\u2019ve set up over there.\u201D\r\nBashin pointed toward the hunting plateau, the smaller plateau where the actual fighting would take place away from the attendants and the bulk of the soldiers. A group of hunters led a lumbering chull around its perimeter, towing a rope draped over the side of the cliff. That rope would be dragging the bait.\r\n\u201CWe\u2019re using hog carcasses,\u201D Bashin explained. \u201CAnd we poured hog\u2019s blood over the sides. The chasmfiend has been spotted by patrols here a good dozen times. He\u2019s got his nest nearby, for certain\u2014he\u2019s not here to pupate. He\u2019s too big for that, and he\u2019s remained in the area too long. So it should be a fine hunt! Once he arrives, we\u2019ll loose a group of wild hogs as distractions, and you can begin weakening him with arrows.\u201D\r\nThey had brought grandbows: large steel bows with thick strings and such a high draw weight that only a Shardbearer could use them, to fire shafts as thick as three fingers. They were recent creations, devised by Alethi engineers through the use of fabrial science, and each required a small infused gemstone to maintain the strength of its pull without warping the metal. Adolin\u2019s aunt Navani\u2014the widow of King Gavilar, mother of Elhokar and his sister Jasnah\u2014had led the research to develop the bows.\r\nIt would be nice if she hadn\u2019t left,Adolin thought idly. Navani was an interesting woman. Things were never boring around her.\r\nSome had started calling the bows Shardbows, but Adolin didn\u2019t like the term. Shardblades and Shardplate were something special. Relics from another time, a time when the Radiants had walked Roshar. No amount of fabrial science had even approached re-creating them.\r\nBashin led the king and his highprinces toward a pavilion at the center of the viewing plateau. Adolin joined his father, intending to give a report on the crossing. About half of the soldiers were in place, but many of the attendants were still making their way across the large, permanent bridge onto the viewing plateau. The king\u2019s banner flapped above the pavilion, and a small refreshment station had been erected. A soldier at the back was setting up the rack of four grandbows. They were sleek and dangerous-looking, with thick black shafts in four quivers beside them.\r\n\u201CI think you\u2019ll have a fine day for the hunt,\u201D Bashin said to Dalinar. \u201CJudging by reports, the beast is a big one. Larger than you\u2019ve ever slain before, Brightlord.\u201D\r\n\u201CGavilar always wanted to slay one of these,\u201D Dalinar said wistfully. \u201CHe loved greatshell hunts, though he never got a chasmfiend. Odd that I\u2019ve now killed so many.\u201D\r\nThe chull pulling the bait bleated in the distance.\r\n\u201CYou need to go for the legs on this one, Brightlords,\u201D Bashin said. Pre-hunt advice was one of Bashin\u2019s responsibilities, and he took those seriously. \u201CChasmfiends, well, you\u2019re used to attacking them in their chrysalises. Don\u2019t forget how mean they are when they\u2019re not pupating. With one this big, use a distraction and come in from\u2026\u201D He trailed off, then groaned, cursing softly. \u201CStorms take that animal. I swear, the man who trained it must have been daft.\u201D\r\nHe was looking across at the next plateau. Adolin followed his glance. The crablike chull that had been towing the bait was lumbering away from the chasm with a slow, yet determined gait. Its handlers were yelling, running after it.\r\n\u201CI\u2019m sorry, Brightlord,\u201D Bashin said. \u201CIt\u2019s been doing this all day.\u201D\r\nThe chull bleated in a gravelly voice. Something seemed wrong to Adolin.\r\n\u201CWe can send for another one,\u201D Elhokar said. \u201CIt shouldn\u2019t take too long to\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CBashin?\u201D Dalinar said, his voice suddenly alarmed. \u201CShouldn\u2019t there be\r\nbaiton the end of that beast\u2019s rope?\u201D\r\nThe huntmaster froze. The rope the chull was towing was frayed at the end.\r\nSomething dark\u2014something mind-numbingly enormous\u2014rose out of the chasm on thick, chitinous legs. It climbed onto the plateau\u2014not the small plateau where the hunt was supposed to take place, but the viewing plateau where Dalinar and Adolin stood. The plateau filled with attendants, unarmed guests, female scribes, and unprepared soldiers.\r\n\u201CAw, Damnation,\u201D Bashin said."

      "ChapterName": "13: TEN HEARTBEATS",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\nI realize that you are probably still angry. That is pleasant to know. Much as your perpetual health, I have come to rely upon your dissatisfaction with me. It is one of the cosmere\u2019s great constants, I should think.\r\nTen heartbeats.\r\nOne.\r\nThat was how long it took to summon a Shardblade. If Dalinar\u2019s heart was racing, the time was shorter. If he was relaxed, it took longer.\r\nTwo.\r\nOn the battlefield, the passing of those beats could stretch like an eternity. He pulled his helm on as he ran.\r\nThree.\r\nThe chasmfiend slammed an arm down, smashing the bridge filled with attendants and soldiers. People screamed, plunging into the chasm. Dalinar dashed forward on Plate-enhanced legs, following the king.\r\nFour.\r\nThe chasmfiend towered like a mountain of interlocking carapace the color of dark violet ink. Dalinar could see why the Parshendi called these things gods. It had a twisted, arrowhead-like face, with a mouth full of barbed mandibles. While it was vaguely crustacean, this was no bulky, placid chull. It had four wicked foreclaws set into broad shoulders, each claw the size of a horse, and a dozen smaller legs that clutched the side of the plateau.\r\nFive.\r\nChitin made a grinding noise against stone as the creature finished pulling itself onto the plateau, snatching a cart-pulling chull with a swift claw.\r\nSix.\r\n\u201CTo arms, to arms!\u201D Elhokar bellowed ahead of Dalinar. \u201CArchers, fire!\u201D\r\nSeven.\r\n\u201CDistract it from the unarmed!\u201D Dalinar bellowed at his soldiers.\r\nThe creature cracked the chull\u2019s shell\u2014platter-size fragments clattering to the plateau\u2014then stuffed the beast into its maw and began looking down at the fleeing scribes and attendants. The chull stopped bleating as the monster crunched down.\r\nEight.\r\nDalinar leaped a rocky shelf and sailed five yards before slamming into the ground, throwing up chips of rock.\r\nNine.\r\nThe chasmfiend bellowed with an awful screeching sound. It trumpeted with four voices, overlapping one another.\r\nArchers drew. Elhokar yelled orders just in front of Dalinar, his blue cape flapping.\r\nDalinar\u2019s hand tingled with anticipation.\r\nTen!\r\nHis Shardblade\u2014Oathbringer\u2014formed in his hand, coalescing from mist, appearing as the tenth beat of his heart thudded in his chest. Six feet long from tip to hilt, the Blade would have been unwieldy in the hands of any man not wearing Shardplate. To Dalinar, it felt perfect. He\u2019d carried Oathbringer since his youth, Bonding to it when he was twenty Weepings old. It was long and slightly curved, a handspan wide, with wavelike serrations near the hilt. It curved at the tip like a fisherman\u2019s hook, and was wet with cold dew.\r\nThis sword was a part of him. He could sense energy racing along its blade, as if it were eager. A man never really knew life itself until he charged into battle with Plate and Blade.\r\n\u201CMake it\r\nangry!\u201D Elhokar bellowed, his Shardblade\u2014Sunraiser\u2014springing from mist into his hand. It was long and thin with a large crossguard, and was etched up the sides with the ten fundamental glyphs. He didn\u2019t want the monster to escape; Dalinar could hear it in his voice. Dalinar was more worried about the soldiers and attendants; this hunt had already turned terribly wrong. Perhaps they should distract the monster long enough for everyone to escape, then pull back and let it dine on chulls and hogs.\r\nThe creature screamed its multivoiced wail again, slamming a claw down among the soldiers. Men screamed; bones splintered and bodies crumpled.\r\nArchers loosed, aiming for the head. A hundred shafts zipped into the air, but only a few hit the soft muscle between plates of chitin. Behind them, Sadeas was calling for his grandbow. Dalinar couldn\u2019t wait for that\u2014the creature was here, dangerous, killing his men. The bow would be too slow. This was a job for the Blade.\r\nAdolin charged past, riding Sureblood. The lad had gone racing for his horse, rather than charging like Elhokar had. Dalinar himself had been forced to stay with the king. The other horses\u2014even the warhorses\u2014panicked, but Adolin\u2019s white Ryshadium stallion held steady. In a moment, Gallant was there, trotting beside Dalinar. Dalinar grabbed the reins and heaved himself into the air with Plate-enhanced legs, jumping up into the saddle. The force of his landing might have strained the back of a regular horse, but Gallant was made of stronger stone than that.\r\nElhokar closed his helm, the sides misting.\r\n\u201CHold back, Your Majesty,\u201D Dalinar called, riding past. \u201CWait until Adolin and I weaken it.\u201D Dalinar reached up, slamming down his own visor. The sides misted, locking it into place, and the sides of the helm became translucent to him. You still needed the eye slit\u2014looking through the sides was like looking through dirty glass\u2014but the translucence was one of the most wonderful parts of Shardplate.\r\nDalinar rode into the monster\u2019s shadow. Soldiers scrambled about, clutching spears. They hadn\u2019t been trained to fight thirty-foot-tall beasts, and it was a testament to their valor that they formed up anyway, trying to draw attention away from the archers and the fleeing attendants.\r\nArrows rained down, bouncing off the carapace and becoming more deadly to the troops below than they were to the chasmfiend. Dalinar raised his free arm to shade his eye slit as an arrow clanged off his helm.\r\nAdolin fell back as the beast swung at a batch of archers, crushing them with one of its claws. \u201CI\u2019ll take left,\u201D Adolin yelled, voice muffled by his helm.\r\nDalinar nodded, cutting to the right, galloping past a group of dazed soldiers and into sunlight again as the chasmfiend raised a foreclaw for another sweep. Dalinar raced under the limb, transferring Oathbringer to his left hand and holding the sword out to the side, slashing it through one of the chasmfiend\u2019s trunklike legs.\r\nThe Blade sheared the thick chitin with barely a tug of resistance. As always, it didn\u2019t cut living flesh, though it killed the leg as surely as if it had been cut free. The large limb slipped, falling numb and useless.\r\nThe monster roared with its deep, overlapping, trumpeting voices. On the other side, Dalinar could make out Adolin slicing at a leg.\r\nThe creature shook, turning toward Dalinar. The two legs that had been cut dragged lifelessly. The monster was long and narrow like a cray-fish, and had a flattened tail. It walked on fourteen legs. How many could it lose before collapsing?\r\nDalinar rounded Gallant, meeting up with Adolin, whose blue Shardplate was gleaming, cape streaming behind him. They switched sides as they turned in wide arcs, each heading for another leg.\r\n\u201CMeet your enemy, monster!\u201D Elhokar bellowed.\r\nDalinar turned. The king had found his mount and had managed to get it under control. Vengeance wasn\u2019t a Ryshadium, but the animal was of the best Shin stock. Astride the animal, Elhokar charged, Blade held above his head.\r\nWell, there was no forbidding him the fight. He should be all right in his Plate so long as he kept moving. \u201CThe legs, Elhokar!\u201D Dalinar shouted.\r\nElhokar ignored him, charging directly for the beast\u2019s chest. Dalinar cursed, heeling Gallant as the monster swung. Elhokar turned at the last moment, leaning low, ducking under the blow. The chasmfiend\u2019s claw hit stone with a cracking sound. It roared in anger at missing Elhokar, the sound echoing through the chasms.\r\nThe king veered toward Dalinar, riding past him in a rush. \u201CI\u2019m distracting it, you fool. Keep attacking!\u201D\r\n\u201CI have the Ryshadium!\u201D Dalinar yelled back at him. \u201CI\u2019ll distract\u2014I\u2019m faster!\u201D\r\nElhokar ignored him again. Dalinar sighed. Elhokar, characteristically, could not be contained. Arguing would only cost more time and more lives, so Dalinar did as he\u2019d been told. He rounded to the side for another approach, Gallant\u2019s hooves beating against the stone ground. The king drew the monster\u2019s direct attention, and Dalinar was able to ride in and slam his Blade through another leg.\r\nThe beast emitted four overlapping screams and turned toward Dalinar. But as it did, Adolin rode past on the other side, cutting at another leg with a deft strike. The leg slumped, and arrows rained down as archers continued to fire.\r\nThe creature shook, confused by the attacks coming from every side. It was getting weak, and Dalinar raised his arm, gesturing. The command ordered the rest of the foot soldiers to retreat toward the pavilion. Orders given, he slipped in and killed another leg. That meant five down. Perhaps it was time to let the beast limp away; killing it now wasn\u2019t worth risking lives.\r\nHe called to the king, who rode\u2014Blade held out to the side\u2014a short distance away. The king glanced at him, but obviously didn\u2019t hear. As the chasmfiend loomed in the background, Elhokar wheeled Vengeance in a sharp right turn toward Dalinar.\r\nThere was a soft\r\nsnap, and suddenly the king\u2014and his saddle\u2014went tumbling through the air. The horse\u2019s quick turn had caused the saddle girth to break. A man in Shardplate was heavy and put a great strain on both his mount and saddle.\r\nDalinar felt a spike of fear, and he reined in Gallant. Elhokar slammed to the ground, dropping his Shardblade. The weapon reverted to mist, vanishing. It was a protection from keeping a Blade from being taken by your enemies; they vanished unless you willed them to stay when releasing them.\r\n\u201CElhokar!\u201D Dalinar bellowed. The king rolled, cape wrapping around his body, then came to rest. He lay dazed for a moment; the armor was cracked on one shoulder, leaking Stormlight. The Plate would have cushioned the fall. He\u2019d be all right.\r\nUnless\u2014\r\nA claw loomed above the king.\r\nDalinar felt a moment of panic, turning Gallant to charge toward the king. He was going to be too slow! The beast would\u2014\r\nAn enormous arrow slammed into the chasmfiend\u2019s head, cracking chitin. Purple gore spurted free, causing the beast to trump in agony. Dalinar twisted in the saddle.\r\nSadeas stood in his red Plate, taking another massive arrow from an attendant. He drew, launching the thick bolt into the chasmfiend\u2019s shoulder with a sharp crack.\r\nDalinar raised Oathbringer in salute. Sadeas acknowledged, raising his bow. They were not friends, and they did not like one another.\r\nBut they\r\nwouldprotect the king. That was the bond that united them.\r\n\u201CGet to safety!\u201D Dalinar yelled to the king as he charged past. Elhokar stumbled to his feet and nodded.\r\nDalinar moved in. He\r\nhadto distract the beast long enough for Elhokar to get away. More of Sadeas\u2019s arrows flew true, but the monster started to ignore them. Its sluggishness vanished, and its bleats became angry, wild, crazed. It was growing truly enraged.\r\nThis was the most dangerous part; there would be no retreating now. It would follow them until it either killed them or was slain.\r\nA claw smashed to the ground just beside Gallant, throwing chips of stone into the air. Dalinar hunkered low, careful to keep his Shardblade out, and he cut free another leg. Adolin had done the same on the other side. Seven legs down, half of them. How long before the beast dropped? Normally, at this stage, they had launched several dozen arrows into the animal. It was difficult to guess what one would do without that prior softening\u2014beside that, he\u2019d never fought one this large before.\r\nHe turned Gallant, trying to draw the creature\u2019s attention. Hopefully, Elhokar had\u2014\r\n\u201CAre you a god!\u201D Elhokar bellowed.\r\nDalinar groaned, looking over his shoulder. The king had\r\nnotfled. He strode toward the beast, hand to the side.\r\n\u201CI defy you, creature!\u201D Elhokar screamed. \u201CI claim your life! They will see their gods crushed, just as they will see their king dead at my feet! I\r\ndefyyou!\u201D\r\nDamnation\u2019s own fool!Dalinar thought, rounding Gallant.\r\nElhokar\u2019s Shardblade reformed in his hands, and he charged toward the monster\u2019s chest, his cracked shoulder leaking Stormlight. He got close and swung at the beast\u2019s torso, cutting free a piece of chitin\u2014like a person\u2019s hair or nails, it could be cut by a Blade. Then Elhokar slammed his weapon into the monster\u2019s breast, seeking its heart.\r\nThe beast roared and shook, knocking Elhokar free. The king barely kept hold of his Blade. The beast spun. That movement, unfortunately, brought its tail at Dalinar. He cursed, yanking Gallant in a tight turn, but the tail came too quickly. It slammed into Gallant, and in a heartbeat Dalinar found himself rolling, Oathbringer tumbling from his fingers and slicing a gash in the stone ground before puffing to mist.\r\n\u201CFather!\u201D a distant voice yelled.\r\nDalinar came to rest on the stones, dizzy. He raised his head to see Gallant stumbling to his feet. Blessedly, the horse hadn\u2019t broken a leg, though the animal bled from scrapes and was favoring one leg.\r\n\u201CAway!\u201D Dalinar said. The command word would send the horse to safety. Unlike Elhokar,\r\nitwould obey.\r\nDalinar climbed to his feet, unsteady. A scraping sound came from his left, and Dalinar spun just in time for the chasmfiend\u2019s tail to take him in the chest, tossing him backward.\r\nAgain the world lurched, and metal hit stone in a cacophony as he slid.\r\nNo!he thought, getting a gauntleted hand beneath himself and heaving, using the momentum of his slide to throw himself upright. As the sky spun, something seemed to\r\nright, as if the Plate itself knew which way was up. He landed\u2014still moving, feet grinding on stone.\r\nHe got his balance, then charged toward the king, beginning the process of summoning his Shardblade again. Ten heartbeats. An eternity.\r\nThe archers continued to fire, and more than a few of their shafts bristled form the chasmfiend\u2019s face. It ignored them, though Sadeas\u2019s larger arrows still seemed to distract it. Adolin had sheared through another leg, and the creature lumbered uncertainly, eight of its fourteen legs dragging uselessly.\r\n\u201CFather!\u201D\r\nDalinar turned to see Renarin\u2014dressed in a stiff blue Kholin uniform, with a long coat buttoning to the neck\u2014riding across the rocky ground. \u201CFather, are you well? Can I help?\u201D\r\n\u201CFool boy!\u201D Dalinar said, pointing. \u201CGo!\u201D\r\n\u201CBut\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CYou\u2019re unarmored and unarmed!\u201D Dalinar bellowed. \u201CGet back before you get yourself killed!\u201D\r\nRenarin pulled his roan horse to a halt.\r\n\u201CGO!\u201D\r\nRenarin galloped away. Dalinar turned and ran toward Elhokar, Oathbringer misting into existence in his waiting hand. Elhokar continued to hack at the beast\u2019s lower torso, and sections of flesh blackened and died when the Shardblade struck. If he rammed the Shardblade in just right, he could stop the heart or lungs, but that would be difficult while the beast was upright.\r\nAdolin\u2014stalwart as always\u2014had dismounted beside the king. He tried to stop the claws, striking at them as they fell. Unfortunately, there were four claws and only one of Adolin. Two swung at him at once, and though Adolin sliced a chunk out of one, he didn\u2019t see the other sweeping at his back.\r\nDalinar called out too late. Shardplate\r\nsnappedas the claw tossed Adolin into the air. He arced and hit in a tumble. His Plate didn\u2019t shatter, thank the Heralds, but the breastplate and side cracked widely, leaking trails of white smoke.\r\nAdolin rolled lethargically, hands moving. He was alive.\r\nNo time to think about him now. Elhokar was alone.\r\nThe beast struck, pounding the ground beside the king, knocking him off his feet. His blade vanished and Elhokar fell face-first on the stones.\r\nSomething changed inside of Dalinar. Reservations vanished. Other concerns became meaningless. His brother\u2019s son was in danger.\r\nHe had failed Gavilar, had lain drunk in his wine while his brother fought for his life. Dalinar should have been there to defend him. Only two things remained of his beloved brother, two things that Dalinar could protect in a hope to earn some form of redemption: Gavilar\u2019s kingdom and Gavilar\u2019s son.\r\nElhokar was alone and in danger.\r\nNothing else mattered.\r\nAdolin shook his head, dazed. He slammed his visor up, taking a gasp of fresh air to clear his mind.\r\nFighting. They were fighting. He could hear men screaming, rocks shaking, an enormous bleating sound. He smelled something moldy. Greatshell blood.\r\nThe chasmfiend!he thought. Before his mind was even clear, Adolin began summoning his Blade again and forced himself to his hands and knees.\r\nThe monster loomed a short distance away, a dark shadow upon the sky. Adolin had fallen near its right side. As his vision lost its fuzziness, he saw that the king was down, and his armor was cracked from the blow he\u2019d taken earlier.\r\nThe chasmfiend raised a massive claw, preparing to slam it down. Adolin knew\u2014suddenly\u2014that disaster was upon them. The king would be killed on a simple hunt. The kingdom would shatter, the highprinces divided, the one tenuous link that kept them together cut away.\r\nNo!Adolin thought, stunned, still dazed, trying to stumble forward.\r\nAnd then he saw his father.\r\nDalinar charged toward the king, moving with a speed and grace no man\u2014not even one wearing Shardplate\u2014should be able to manage. He leaped over a rock shelf, then ducked and skidded beneath a claw swinging for him. Other men thought they understood Shardblades and Shardplate, but Dalinar Kholin\u2026at times, he proved them all children.\r\nDalinar straightened and leaped\u2014still moving forward\u2014cresting by inches a second claw that smashed apart the rocky shelf behind him.\r\nIt was all just a moment. A breath. The third claw was falling toward the king, and Dalinar roared, leaping forward. He dropped his Blade\u2014it hit the ground and puffed away\u2014as he skidded beneath the falling claw. He raised his hands and\u2014\r\nAnd he caught it. He bent beneath the blow, going down on one knee, and the air rang with a resounding clang of carapace against armor.\r\nBut he\r\ncaught it.\r\nStormfather!Adolin thought, watching his father stand over the king, bowed beneath the enormous weight of a monster many times his size. Shocked archers hesitated. Sadeas lowered his grandbow. Adolin\u2019s breath caught in his chest.\r\nDalinar held back the claw and matched its strength, a figure in dark, silvery metal that almost seemed to glow. The beast trumpeted above, and Dalinar bellowed back a powerful, defiant yell.\r\nIn that moment, Adolin knew he was seeing\r\nhim. The Blackthorn, the very man he\u2019d been wishing he could fight alongside. The Plate of Dalinar\u2019s gauntlets and shoulders began to crack, webs of light moving down the ancient metal. Adolin finally shook himself into motion.\r\nI have to help!\r\nHis Shardblade formed in his hand and he scrambled to the side and sheared through the leg nearest to him. There was a crack in the air. With so many legs down, the beast\u2019s other legs couldn\u2019t hold its weight, particularly when it was trying so hard to crush Dalinar. The remaining legs on its right side snapped with a sickening crunch, spraying out violet ichor, and the beast toppled to the side.\r\nThe ground shook, nearly knocking Adolin to his knees. Dalinar tossed aside the now-limp claw, Stormlight from the many cracks steaming above him. Nearby, the king picked himself up off the ground\u2014it had been mere seconds since he\u2019d fallen.\r\nElhokar stumbled to his feet, looking at the fallen beast. Then he turned to his uncle, the Blackthorn.\r\nDalinar nodded thankfully to Adolin, then gestured sharply toward what passed for the beast\u2019s neck. Elhokar nodded, then summoned his Blade and rammed it deeply into the monster\u2019s flesh. The creature\u2019s uniform green eyes blackened and shriveled, smoke twisting into the air.\r\nAdolin walked up to join his father, watching as Elhokar plunged his Blade into the chasmfiend\u2019s chest. Now that the beast was dead, the Blade could cut its flesh. Violet ichor spurted out, and Elhokar dropped his blade and reached into the wound, questing with Plate-enhanced arms, grabbing something.\r\nHe ripped free the beast\u2019s gemheart\u2014the enormous gemstone that grew within all chasmfiends. It was lumpy and uncut, but it was a pure emerald and as big as a man\u2019s head. It was the largest gemheart Adolin had ever seen, and even the small ones were worth a fortune.\r\nElhokar held aloft the grisly prize, golden gloryspren appearing around him, and the soldiers yelled in triumph."

      "ChapterName": "14: PAYDAY",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\nLet me first assure you that the element is quite safe. I have found a good home for it. I protect its safety like I protect my own skin, you might say.\r\nThe morning after his decision in the highstorm, Kaladin made certain to arise before the others. He threw off his blanket and strode through the room full of blanketed lumps. He didn\u2019t feel excited, but he\r\ndidfeel resolute. Determined to fight again.\r\nHe began that fight by throwing the door open to the sunlight. Groans and curses sounded behind him as the groggy bridgemen awoke. Kaladin turned toward them, hands on hips. Bridge Four currently had thirty-four members. That number fluctuated, but at least twenty-five were needed to carry the bridge. Anything below that, and the bridge would topple for certain. Sometimes, it did even with more members.\r\n\u201CUp and organize!\u201D Kaladin shouted in his best squadleader\u2019s voice. He shocked himself with the authority in it.\r\nThe men blinked bleary eyes.\r\n\u201CThat\r\nmeans,\u201D Kaladin bellowed, \u201Cout of the barrack and form ranks! You\u2019ll do it now, storm you, or I\u2019ll haul you out one by one myself!\u201D\r\nSyl fluttered down and landed on his shoulder, watching curiously. Some of the bridgemen sat up, staring at him, baffled. Others turned over in their blankets, putting their backs to him.\r\nKaladin took a deep breath. \u201CSo be it.\u201D He strode into the room and chose a lean Alethi named Moash. He was a strong man; Kaladin needed an example, and one of the skinnier men like Dunny or Narm wouldn\u2019t do. Plus, Moash was one of those who\u2019d turned over to go back to sleep.\r\nKaladin grabbed Moash by one arm and heaved, pulling with all his strength. Moash stumbled to his feet. He was a younger man, perhaps near Kaladin\u2019s age, and had a hawkish face.\r\n\u201CStorm off!\u201D Moash snapped, pulling his arm back.\r\nKaladin punched Moash right in the gut, where he knew it would wind him. Moash gasped in shock, doubling over, and Kaladin stepped forward to grab him by the legs, slinging Moash over his shoulder.\r\nKaladin almost toppled from the weight. Luckily, carrying bridges was harsh but effective strength training. Of course, few bridgemen survived long enough to benefit from it. It didn\u2019t help that there were unpredictable lulls between runs. That was part of the problem; the bridge crews spent most of their time staring at their feet or doing menial chores, then were expected to run for miles carrying a bridge.\r\nHe carted the shocked Moash outside and set him down on the stone. The rest of the camp was awake, woodworkers arriving at the lumberyard, soldiers jogging to their breakfast or training. The other bridge crews, of course, were still asleep. They were often allowed to sleep late, unless they were on morning bridge duty.\r\nKaladin left Moash and walked back into the low-ceilinged barrack. \u201CI\u2019ll do the same to each of you, if I have to.\u201D\r\nHe didn\u2019t have to. The shocked bridgemen filed out into the light, blinking. Most stood bare-backed to the sunlight, wearing only knee-length trousers. Moash climbed to his feet, rubbing his stomach and glaring at Kaladin.\r\n\u201CThings are going to change in Bridge Four,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CFor one thing, there will be no more sleeping in.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd what are we going to do instead?\u201D Sigzil demanded. He had dark brown skin and black hair\u2014that meant he was Makabaki, from southwestern Roshar. He was the only bridgeman without a beard, and judging by his smooth accent, he was probably Azish or Emuli. Foreigners were common in bridge crews\u2014those who didn\u2019t fit in often made their way to the crem of an army.\r\n\u201CExcellent question,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CWe are going to train. Each morning before our daily chores, we will run the bridge in practice to build up our endurance.\u201D\r\nMore than one of the men\u2019s expressions grew dark at this.\r\n\u201CI know what you are thinking,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CAren\u2019t our lives hard enough? Shouldn\u2019t we be able to relax during the brief times we have for it?\u201D\r\n\u201CYeah,\u201D said Leyten, a tall, stout man with curly hair. \u201CThat\u2019s right.\u201D\r\n\u201C\r\nNo,\u201D Kaladin snapped. \u201CBridge runs exhaust us because we spend most of our days lounging. Oh, I know we have chores\u2014foraging in the chasms, cleaning latrines, scrubbing floors. But the soldiers don\u2019t expect us to work hard; they just want us busy. The work helps them ignore us.\r\n\u201CAs your bridgeleader, my primary duty is to keep you alive. There\u2019s not much I can do about the Parshendi arrows, so I have to do something about\r\nyou. I have to make you stronger, so that when you charge that last leg of a bridge run\u2014arrows flying\u2014you can run quickly.\u201D He met the eyes of the men in the line, one at a time. \u201CI intend to see that Bridge Four never loses another man.\u201D\r\nThe men stared at him incredulously. Finally, a hefty, thick-limbed man at the back bellowed out a laugh. He had tan skin, deep red hair, and was nearly seven feet tall, with large arms and a powerful torso. The Unkalaki\u2014simply called Horneaters by most\u2014were a group of people from the middle of Roshar, near Jah Keved. He\u2019d given his name as \u201CRock\u201D the previous night.\r\n\u201CCrazy!\u201D said the Horneater. \u201CIs crazy man who now thinks to lead us!\u201D He laughed in a deep-bellied way. The others joined him, shaking their heads at Kaladin\u2019s speech. A few laughterspren\u2014minnowlike silver spirits that darted through the air in circular patterns\u2014began to zip about them.\r\n\u201CHey Gaz,\u201D Moash called, cupping his hand around his mouth.\r\nThe short, one-eyed sergeant was chatting with some soldiers nearby. \u201CWhat?\u201D Gaz yelled back with a scowl.\r\n\u201CThis one wants us to carry bridges about as practice,\u201D Moash called back. \u201CDo we have to do what he says?\u201D\r\n\u201CBah,\u201D Gaz said, waving a hand. \u201CBridgeleaders only have authority in the field.\u201D\r\nMoash glanced back at Kaladin. \u201CLooks like you can storm off, friend. Unless you\u2019re going to beat us all into submission.\u201D\r\nThey broke apart, some men wandering back into the barrack, some walking toward the mess halls. Kaladin was left standing alone on the stones.\r\n\u201CThat didn\u2019t go so well,\u201D Syl said from his shoulder.\r\n\u201CNo. It didn\u2019t.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou look surprised.\u201D\r\n\u201CNo, just frustrated.\u201D He glared at Gaz. The bridge sergeant turned away from him pointedly. \u201CIn Amaram\u2019s army, I was given men who were inexperienced, but never ones who were blatantly insubordinate.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat\u2019s the difference?\u201D Syl asked. Such an innocent question. The answer should have been obvious, but she cocked her head in confusion.\r\n\u201CThe men in Amaram\u2019s army knew they had worse places they could go. You could punish them. These bridgemen know they\u2019ve reached the bottom.\u201D With a sigh, he let some of his tension bleed away. \u201CI\u2019m lucky I got them out of the barrack.\u201D\r\n\u201CSo what do you do now?\u201D\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know.\u201D Kaladin glanced to the side, where Gaz still stood chatting with the soldiers. \u201CActually, yes I do.\u201D\r\nGaz caught sight of Kaladin approaching and displayed a look of urgent, wide-eyed horror. He broke off his conversation and hastily rushed around the side of a stack of logs.\r\n\u201CSyl,\u201D Kaladin said, \u201Ccould you follow him for me?\u201D\r\nShe smiled, then became a faint line of white, shooting through the air and leaving a trail that vanished slowly. Kaladin stopped where Gaz had been standing.\r\nSyl zipped back a short time later and reassumed her girlish form. \u201CHe\u2019s hiding between those two barracks.\u201D She pointed. \u201CHe\u2019s crouched there, watching to see if you follow.\u201D\r\nWith a smile, Kaladin took the long way around the barracks. In the alleyway, he found a figure crouching in the shadows, watching in the other direction. Kaladin crept forward, then grabbed Gaz\u2019s shoulder. Gaz let out a yelp, spinning, swinging. Kaladin caught the fist easily.\r\nGaz looked up at Kaladin with horror. \u201CI wasn\u2019t going to lie! Storm you, you\r\ndon\u2019thave authority anywhere other than on the field. If you hurt me again, I\u2019ll have you\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CCalm yourself, Gaz,\u201D Kaladin said, releasing the man. \u201CI\u2019m not going to hurt you. Not yet, at least.\u201D\r\nThe shorter man backed away, rubbing his shoulder and glaring at Kaladin.\r\n\u201CToday\u2019s third pass,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CPayday.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou get your pay in an hour like everyone else.\u201D\r\n\u201CNo. You have it now; I saw you talking to the courier there.\u201D He held out his hand.\r\nGaz grumbled, but pulled out a pouch and counted spheres. Tiny, tentative white lights shone at their centers. Diamond marks, each worth five diamond chips. A single chip would buy a loaf of bread.\r\nGaz counted out four marks, though there were five days to a week. He handed them to Kaladin, but Kaladin left his hand open, palm forward. \u201CThe other one, Gaz.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou said\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CNow.\u201D\r\nGaz jumped, then pulled out a sphere. \u201CYou have a strange way of keeping your word, lordling. You promised me\u2026\u201D\r\nHe trailed off as Kaladin took the sphere he\u2019d just been given and handed it back.\r\nGaz frowned.\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t forget where this comes from, Gaz. I\u2019ll keep to my word, but you aren\u2019t keeping part of my pay. I\u2019m\r\ngivingit to you. Understand?\u201D\r\nGaz looked confused, though he did snatch the sphere from Kaladin\u2019s hand.\r\n\u201CThe money stops coming if something happens to me,\u201D Kaladin said, tucking the other four spheres into his pocket. Then he stepped forward. Kaladin was a tall man, and he loomed over the much shorter Gaz. \u201CRemember our bargain. Stay out of my way.\u201D\r\nGaz refused to be intimidated. He spat to the side, the dark spittle clinging to the rock wall, oozing slowly. \u201CI ain\u2019t going to lie for you. If you think one cremstained mark a week will\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CI expect only what I said. What is Bridge Four\u2019s camp duty today?\u201D\r\n\u201CEvening meal. Scrubbing and cleaning.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd bridge duty?\u201D\r\n\u201CAfternoon shift.\u201D\r\nThat meant the morning would be open. The crew would like that; they could spend payday losing their spheres on gambling or whores, perhaps forgetting for a short time the miserable lives they lived. They\u2019d have to be back for afternoon duty, waiting in the lumberyard in case there was a bridge run. After evening meal, they\u2019d go scrub pots.\r\nAnother wasted day. Kaladin turned to walk back to the lumberyard.\r\n\u201CYou aren\u2019t going to change anything,\u201D Gaz called after him. \u201CThose men are bridgemen for a reason.\u201D\r\nKaladin kept walking, Syl zipping down from the roof to land on his shoulder.\r\n\u201CYou don\u2019t have authority,\u201D Gaz called. \u201CYou\u2019re not some squadleader on the field. You\u2019re a storming\r\nbridgeman. You hear me? You can\u2019t have authority without a rank!\u201D\r\nKaladin left the alleyway behind. \u201CHe\u2019s wrong.\u201D\r\nSyl walked around to hang in front of his face, hovering there while he moved. She cocked her head at him.\r\n\u201CAuthority doesn\u2019t come from a rank,\u201D Kaladin said, fingering the spheres in his pocket.\r\n\u201CWhere does it come from?\u201D\r\n\u201CFrom the men who give it to you. That\u2019s the only way to get it.\u201D He looked back the way he\u2019d come. Gaz hadn\u2019t left the alleyway yet. \u201CSyl, you don\u2019t sleep, do you?\u201D\r\n\u201CSleep? A spren?\u201D She seemed amused by the concept.\r\n\u201CWould you watch over me at night?\u201D he said. \u201CMake sure Gaz doesn\u2019t sneak in and try something while I\u2019m sleeping? He may try to have me killed.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou think he\u2019d actually do that?\u201D\r\nKaladin thought for a moment. \u201CNo. No, probably not. I\u2019ve known a dozen men like him\u2014petty bullies with just enough power to be annoying. Gaz is a thug, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s a murderer. Besides, in his opinion, he doesn\u2019t\r\nhaveto hurt me; he just has to wait until I get killed on a bridge run. Still, best to be safe. Watch over me, if you would. Wake me if he tries something.\u201D\r\n\u201CSure. But what if he just goes to more important men? Tells them to execute you?\u201D\r\nKaladin grimaced. \u201CThen there\u2019s nothing I can do. But I don\u2019t think he\u2019d do that. It would make him look weak before his superiors.\u201D\r\nBesides, beheading was reserved for bridgemen who wouldn\u2019t run at the Parshendi. So long as he ran, he wouldn\u2019t be executed. In fact, the army leaders seemed hesitant to do much to punish bridgemen at all. One man had committed murder while Kaladin had been a bridgeman, and they\u2019d strung the fool up in a highstorm. But other than that, all Kaladin had seen was a few men get their wages garnished for brawling, and a couple get whipped for being too slow during the early part of a bridge run.\r\nMinimal punishments. The leaders of this army understood. The lives of bridgemen were as close to hopeless as possible; shove them down too much further, and the bridgemen might just stop caring and let themselves be killed.\r\nUnfortunately, that also meant that there wouldn\u2019t be much Kaladin could do to punish his own crew, even if he\u2019d had that authority. He had to motivate them in another way. He crossed the lumberyard to where the carpenters were constructing new bridges. After some searching, Kaladin found what he wanted\u2014a thick plank waiting to be fitted into a new portable bridge. A handhold for a bridgeman had been affixed to one side.\r\n\u201CCan I borrow this?\u201D Kaladin asked a passing carpenter.\r\nThe man raised a hand to scratch a sawdust-powdered head. \u201CBorrow it?\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll stay right here in the lumberyard,\u201D Kaladin explained, lifting the board and putting it on his shoulder. It was heavier than he\u2019d expected, and he was thankful for the padded leather vest.\r\n\u201CWe\u2019ll need it eventually\u2026\u201D the carpenter said, but didn\u2019t offer enough of an objection to stop Kaladin from walking away with the plank.\r\nHe chose a level stretch of stone directly in front of the barracks. Then he began to trot from one end of the lumberyard to the other, carrying the board on his shoulder, feeling the heat of the rising sun on his skin. He went back and forth, back and forth. He practiced running, walking, and jogging. He practiced carrying the plank on his shoulder, then carrying it up high, arms stretched out.\r\nHe worked himself ragged. In fact, he felt close to collapsing several times, but every time he did, he found a reserve of strength from somewhere. So he kept moving, teeth gritted against the pain and fatigue, counting his steps to focus. The apprentice carpenter he\u2019d spoken to brought a supervisor over. That supervisor scratched his head beneath his cap, watching Kaladin. Finally, he shrugged, and the two of them withdrew.\r\nBefore long, he drew a small crowd. Workers in the lumberyard, some soldiers, and a large number of bridgemen. Some from the other bridge crews called gibes, but the members of Bridge Four were more withdrawn. Many ignored him. Others\u2014grizzled Teft, youthful-faced Dunny, several more\u2014stood watching in a line, as if they couldn\u2019t believe what he was doing.\r\nThose stares\u2014stunned and hostile though they were\u2014were part of what kept Kaladin going. He also ran to work out his frustration, that boiling, churning pot of anger within. Anger at himself for failing Tien. Anger at the Almighty for creating a world where some dined in luxury while others died carrying bridges.\r\nIt felt surprisingly good to wear himself down in a way he chose. He felt as he had those first few months after Tien\u2019s death, training himself on the spear to forget. When the noon bells rang\u2014calling the soldiers to lunch\u2014Kaladin finally stopped and set the large plank down on the ground. He rolled his shoulder. He\u2019d been running for hours. Where had he found the strength?\r\nHe jogged over to the carpenter\u2019s station, dripping sweat to the stones, and took a long drink from the water barrel. The carpenters usually chased off bridgemen who tried that, but none said a word as Kaladin slurped down two full ladles of metallic rainwater. He shook the ladle free and nodded to a pair of apprentices, then jogged back to where he\u2019d left the plank.\r\nRock\u2014the large, tan-skinned Horneater\u2014was hefting it, frowning.\r\nTeft noticed Kaladin, then nodded to Rock. \u201CHe bet a few of us a chip each that you\u2019d used a lightweight board to impress us.\u201D\r\nIf they could have felt his exhaustion, they wouldn\u2019t have been so skeptical. He forced himself to take the plank from Rock. The large man let it go with a bewildered look, watching as Kaladin ran the plank back to where he\u2019d found it. He waved his thanks to the apprentice, then trotted back to the small cluster of bridgemen. Rock was reluctantly paying out chips on his bet.\r\n\u201CYou\u2019re dismissed for lunch,\u201D Kaladin told them. \u201CWe have afternoon bridge duty, so be back here in an hour. Assemble at the mess hall at last bell before sundown. Our camp chore today is cleaning up after supper. Last one to arrive has to do the pots.\u201D\r\nThey gave him bemused expressions as he trotted away from the lumberyard. Two streets away, he ducked into an alleyway and leaned against the wall. Then, wheezing, he sank to the ground and stretched out.\r\nHe felt as if he\u2019d strained every muscle in his body. His legs burned, and when he tried to make his hand into a fist, the fingers were too weak to fully comply. He breathed in and out in deep gasps, coughing. A passing soldier peeked in, but when he saw the bridgeman\u2019s outfit, he left without a word.\r\nEventually, Kaladin felt a light touch on his chest. He opened his eyes and found Syl lying prone in the air, face toward his. Her feet were toward the wall, but her posture\u2014indeed, the way her dress hung\u2014made it seem as if she were standing upright, not face toward the ground.\r\n\u201CKaladin,\u201D she said, \u201CI have something to tell you.\u201D\r\nHe closed his eyes again.\r\n\u201CKaladin, this is important!\u201D He felt a slight\r\njoltof energy on his eyelid. It was a very strange sensation. He grumbled, opening his eyes and forcing himself to sit. She walked in the air, as if circumnavigating an invisible sphere, until she was standing up in the right direction.\r\n\u201CI have decided,\u201D Syl declared, \u201Cthat I\u2019m glad you kept your word to Gaz, even if he is a disgusting person.\u201D\r\nIt took Kaladin a moment to realize what she was talking about. \u201CThe spheres?\u201D\r\nShe nodded. \u201CI thought you might break your word, but I\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t.\u201D\r\n\u201CAll right. Well, thank you for telling me, I guess.\u201D\r\n\u201CKaladin,\u201D she said petulantly, making fists at her side. \u201CThis is\r\nimportant.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2026\u201D He trailed off, then rested his head back against the wall. \u201CSyl, I can barely breathe, let alone think. Please. Just tell me what\u2019s bothering you.\u201D\r\n\u201CI know what a lie is,\u201D she said, moving over and sitting on his knee. \u201CA few weeks ago, I didn\u2019t even understand the\r\nconceptof lying. But now I\u2019m happy that you didn\u2019t lie. Don\u2019t you see?\u201D\r\n\u201CNo.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m changing.\u201D She shivered\u2014it must have been an intentional action, for her entire figure fuzzed for a moment. \u201CI know things I didn\u2019t just a few days ago. It feels so strange.\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, I guess that\u2019s a good thing. I mean, the more you understand, the better. Right?\u201D\r\nShe looked down. \u201CWhen I found you near the chasm after the highstorm yesterday,\u201D she whispered, \u201Cyou were going to kill yourself, weren\u2019t you?\u201D\r\nKaladin didn\u2019t respond. Yesterday. That was an eternity ago.\r\n\u201CI gave you a leaf,\u201D she said. \u201CA\r\npoisonousleaf. You could have used it to kill yourself or someone else. That\u2019s what you were probably planning to use it for in the first place, back in the wagons.\u201D She looked back up into his eyes, and her tiny voice seemed terrified. \u201CToday, I know what death is. Why do I know what death is, Kaladin?\u201D\r\nKaladin frowned. \u201CYou\u2019ve always been odd, for a spren. Even from the start.\u201D\r\n\u201CFrom the very start?\u201D\r\nHe hesitated, thinking back. No, the first few times she\u2019d come, she\u2019d acted like any other windspren. Playing pranks on him, sticking his shoe to the floor, then hiding. Even when she\u2019d persisted with him during the months of his slavery, she\u2019d acted mostly like any other spren. Losing interest in things quickly, flitting around.\r\n\u201CYesterday, I didn\u2019t know what death was,\u201D she said. \u201CToday I do. Months ago, I didn\u2019t know I was acting oddly for a spren, but I grew to realize that I was. How do I even know\r\nhowa spren is supposed to act?\u201D She shrank down, looking smaller. \u201CWhat\u2019s happening to me? What am I?\u201D\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know. Does it matter?\u201D\r\n\u201CShouldn\u2019t it?\u201D\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know what I am either. A bridgeman? A surgeon? A soldier? A slave? Those are all just labels. Inside, I\u2019m me. A very different me than I was a year ago, but I can\u2019t worry about that, so I just keep moving and hope my feet take me where I need to go.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou aren\u2019t angry at me for bringing you that leaf?\u201D\r\n\u201CSyl, if you hadn\u2019t interrupted me, I\u2019d have stepped off into the chasm. That leaf was what I needed. It was the right thing, somehow.\u201D\r\nShe smiled, and watched as Kaladin began to stretch. Once he finished, he stood and stepped out onto the street again, mostly recovered from his exhaustion. She zipped into the air and rested on his shoulder, sitting with her arms back and her feet hanging down in front, like a girl on the side of a cliff. \u201CI\u2019m glad you\u2019re not angry. Though I\r\ndothink that you\u2019re to blame for what\u2019s happening to me. Before I met you, I never had to think about death or lying.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s how I am,\u201D he said dryly. \u201CBringing death and lies wherever I go. Me and the Nightwatcher.\u201D\r\nShe frowned.\r\n\u201CThat was\u2014\u201D he began.\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D she said. \u201CThat was sarcasm.\u201D She cocked her head. \u201CI know what sarcasm is.\u201D Then she smiled deviously. \u201CI know what sarcasm is!\u201D\r\nStormfather,Kaladin thought, looking into those gleeful little eyes.\r\nThat strikes me as ominous.\r\n\u201CSo, wait,\u201D he said. \u201CThis sort of thing has never happened to you before?\u201D\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t remember anything farther back than about a year ago, when I first saw you.\u201D\r\n\u201CReally?\u201D\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s not odd,\u201D Syl said, shrugging translucent shoulders. \u201CMost spren don\u2019t have long memories.\u201D She hesitated. \u201CI don\u2019t know why I know that.\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, maybe this is normal. You could have gone through this cycle before, but you\u2019ve just forgotten it.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s not very comforting. I don\u2019t like the idea of forgetting.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut don\u2019t death and lying make you uncomfortable?\u201D\r\n\u201CThey do. But, if I were to lose these memories\u2026\u201D She glanced into the air, and Kaladin traced her movements, noting a pair of windspren darting through the sky on a gusting breeze, uncaring and free.\r\n\u201CScared to go onward,\u201D Kaladin said, \u201Cbut terrified to go back to what you were.\u201D\r\nShe nodded.\r\n\u201CI know how you feel,\u201D he said. \u201CCome on. I need to eat, and there are some things I want to pick up after lunch.\u201D"

      "ChapterName": "15: THE DECOY",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\nYou do not agree with my quest. I understand that, so much as it is possible to understand someone with whom I disagree so completely.\r\nFour hours after the chasmfiend attack, Adolin was still overseeing the cleanup. In the struggle, the monster had destroyed the bridge leading back to the warcamps. Fortunately, some soldiers had been left on the other side, and they\u2019d gone to fetch a bridge crew.\r\nAdolin walked amid the soldiers, gathering reports as the late afternoon sun inched toward the horizon. The air had a musty, moldy scent. The smell of greatshell blood. The beast itself lay where it had fallen, chest cut open. Some soldiers were harvesting its carapace amid cremlings that had come out to feast on the carcass. To Adolin\u2019s left, long lines of men lay in rows, using cloaks or shirts as pillows on the ragged plateau surface. Surgeons from Dalinar\u2019s army tended them. Adolin blessed his father for always bringing the surgeons, even on a routine expedition like this one.\r\nHe continued on his way, still wearing his Shardplate. The troops could have made their way back to the warcamps by another route\u2014there was still a bridge on the other side, leading farther out onto the Plains. They could have moved eastward, then wrapped back around. Dalinar, however, had made the call\u2014much to Sadeas\u2019s dismay\u2014that they would wait and tend the wounded, resting the few hours it would take to get a bridge crew.\r\nAdolin glanced toward the pavilion, which tinkled with laughter. Several large rubies glowed brightly, set atop poles, with worked golden tines holding them in place. They were fabrials that gave off heat, though there was no fire involved. He didn\u2019t understand how fabrials worked, though the more spectacular ones needed large gemstones to function.\r\nOnce again, the other lighteyes enjoyed their leisure while he worked. This time he didn\u2019t mind. He would have found it difficult to enjoy himself after such a disaster. And it\r\nhadbeen a disaster. A minor lighteyed officer approached, carrying a final list of casualties. The man\u2019s wife read it, then they left him with the sheet and retreated.\r\nThere were nearly fifty men dead, twice as many wounded. Many were men Adolin had known. When the king had been given the initial estimate, he had brushed aside the deaths, indicating that they\u2019d be rewarded for their valor with positions in the Heraldic Forces above. He seemed to have conveniently forgotten that he\u2019d have been one of the casualties himself, if not for Dalinar.\r\nAdolin sought out his father with his eyes; Dalinar stood at the edge of the plateau, looking eastward again. What did he search for out there? This wasn\u2019t the first time Adolin had seen such extraordinary actions from his father, but they had seemed particularly dramatic. Standing beneath the massive chasmfiend, holding it back from killing his nephew, Plate glowing. That image was fixed in Adolin\u2019s memory.\r\nThe other lighteyes stepped more lightly around Dalinar now, and during the last few hours, Adolin hadn\u2019t heard a single mention of his weakness, not even from Sadeas\u2019s men. He feared it wouldn\u2019t last. Dalinar\r\nwasheroic, but only infrequently. In the weeks that followed, the others would begin to talk again of how he rarely went on plateau assaults, about how he\u2019d lost his edge.\r\nAdolin found himself thirsting for more. Today when Dalinar had leaped to protect Elhokar, he\u2019d acted like the stories said he had during his youth. Adolin wanted that man back. The kingdom needed him.\r\nAdolin sighed, turning away. He needed to give the final casualty report to the king. Likely he\u2019d be mocked for it, but perhaps\u2014in waiting to deliver it\u2014he might be able to listen in on Sadeas. Adolin still felt he was missing something about that man. Something his father saw, but he did not.\r\nSo, steeling himself for the barbs, he made his way toward the pavilion.\r\nDalinar faced eastward with gauntleted hands clasped behind his back. Somewhere out there, at the center of the Plains, the Parshendi made their base camp.\r\nAlethkar had been at war for nearly six years, engaging in an extended siege. The siege strategy had been suggested by Dalinar himself\u2014striking at the Parshendi base would have required camping on the Plains, weathering highstorms, and relying on a large number of fragile bridges. One failed battle, and the Alethi could have found themselves trapped and surrounded, without any way back to fortified positions.\r\nBut the Shattered Plains could also be a trap for the Parshendi. The eastern and southern edges were impassable\u2014the plateaus there were weathered to the point that many were little more than spires, and the Parshendi could not jump the distance between them. The Plains were edged by mountains, and packs of chasmfiends prowled the land between, enormous and dangerous.\r\nWith the Alethi army boxing them in on the west and north\u2014and with scouts placed south and east just in case\u2014the Parshendi could not escape. Dalinar had argued that the Parshendi would run out of supplies. They\u2019d either have to expose themselves and try to escape the Plains, or would have to attack the Alethi in their fortified warcamps.\r\nIt had been an excellent plan. Except, Dalinar hadn\u2019t anticipated the gemhearts.\r\nHe turned from the chasm, walking across the plateau. He itched to go see to his men, but he needed to show trust in Adolin. He was in command, and he would do well by it. In fact, it seemed he was already taking some final reports over to Elhokar.\r\nDalinar smiled, looking at his son. Adolin was shorter than Dalinar, and his hair was blond mixed with black. The blond was an inheritance from his mother, or so Dalinar had been told. Dalinar himself remembered nothing of the woman. She had been excised from his memory, leaving strange gaps and foggy areas. Sometimes he could remember an exact scene, with everyone else crisp and clear, but\r\nshewas a blur. He couldn\u2019t even remember her name. When others spoke it, it slipped from his mind, like a pat of butter sliding off a too-hot knife.\r\nHe left Adolin to make his report and walked up to the chasmfiend\u2019s carcass. It lay slumped over on its side, eyes burned out, mouth lying open. There was no tongue, just the curious teeth of a greatshell, with a strange, complex network of jaws. Some flat platelike teeth for crushing and destroying shells and other, smaller mandibles for ripping off flesh or shoving it deeper into the throat. Rockbuds had opened nearby, their vines reaching out to lap up the beast\u2019s blood. There was a connection between a man and the beast he hunted, and Dalinar always felt a strange melancholy after killing a creature as majestic as a chasmfiend.\r\nMost gemhearts were harvested quite differently than the one had been today. Sometime during the strange life cycle of the chasmfiends, they sought the western side of the Plains, where the plateaus were wider. They climbed up onto the tops and made a rocky chrysalis, waiting for the coming of a highstorm.\r\nDuring that time, they were vulnerable. You just had to get to the plateau where it rested, break into its chrysalis with some mallets or a Shardblade, then cut out the gemheart. Easy work for a fortune. And the beasts came frequently, often several times a week, so long as the weather didn\u2019t get too cold.\r\nDalinar looked up at the hulking carcass. Tiny, near-invisible spren were floating out of the beast\u2019s body, vanishing into the air. They looked like the tongues of smoke that might come off a candle after being snuffed. Nobody knew what kind of spren they were; you only saw them around the freshly killed bodies of greatshells.\r\nHe shook his head. The gemhearts had changed everything for the war. The Parshendi wanted them too, wanted them badly enough to extend themselves. Fighting the Parshendi for the greatshells made sense, for the Parshendi could not replenish their troops from home as the Alethi could. So contests over the greatshells were both profitable and a tactically sound way of advancing the siege.\r\nWith the evening coming on, Dalinar could see lights twinkling across the Plains. Towers where men watched for chasmfiends coming up to pupate. They\u2019d watch through the night, though chasmfiends rarely came in the evening or night. The scouts crossed chasms with jumping poles, moving very lightly from plateau to plateau without the need of bridges. Once a chasmfiend was spotted the scouts would sound warning, and it became\u00A0a race\u2014Alethi against Parshendi. Seize the plateau and hold it long enough to get out the gemheart, attack the enemy if they got there first.\r\nEach highprince wanted those gemhearts. Paying and feeding thousands of troops was not cheap, but a single gemheart could cover a highprince\u2019s expenses for months. Beyond that, the larger a gemstone was when used by a Soulcaster, the less likely it was to shatter. Enormous gemheart stones offered near-limitless potential. And so, the highprinces raced. The first one to a chrysalis got to fight the Parshendi for the gemheart.\r\nThey could have taken turns, but that was not the Alethi way. Competition was doctrine to them. Vorinism taught that the finest warriors would have the holy privilege of joining the Heralds after death, fighting to reclaim the Tranquiline Halls from the Voidbringers. The highprinces were allies, but they were also rivals. To give up a gemheart to another\u2026well, it felt wrong. Better to have a contest. And so what had been a war had become sport instead. Deadly sport\u2014but that was the best kind.\r\nDalinar left the fallen chasmfiend behind. He understood each step in the process of what had happened during these six years. He\u2019d even hastened some of them. Only now did he worry. They\r\nweremaking headway in cutting down the Parshendi numbers, but the original goal of vengeance for Gavilar\u2019s murder had nearly been forgotten. The Alethi lounged, they played, and they idled.\r\nEven though they\u2019d killed plenty of Parshendi\u2014as many as a quarter of their originally estimated forces were dead\u2014this was just taking so long. The siege had lasted six years, and could easily take another six. That troubled him. Obviously the Parshendi had expected to be besieged here. They\u2019d prepared supply dumps and had been ready to move their entire population to the Shattered Plains, where they could use these Heralds-forsaken chasms and plateaus like hundreds of moats and fortifications.\r\nElhokar had sent messengers, demanding to know why the Parshendi had killed his father. They had never given an answer. They\u2019d taken credit for his murder, but had offered no explanation. Of late, it seemed that Dalinar was the only one who still wondered about that.\r\nDalinar turned to the side; Elhokar\u2019s attendants had retired to the pavilion, enjoying wine and refreshments. The large open-sided tent was dyed violet and yellow, and a light breeze ruffled the canvas. There was a small chance that another highstorm might arrive tonight, the stormwardens said. Almighty send that the army was back to the camp if one did come.\r\nHighstorms. Visions.\r\nUnite them\u2026.\r\nDid he really believe in what he\u2019d seen? Did he really think that the Almighty himself had spoken to him? Dalinar Kholin, the Blackthorn, a fearsome warlord?\r\nUnite them.\r\nAt the pavilion, Sadeas walked out into the night. He had removed his helm, revealing a head of thick black hair that curled and tumbled around his shoulders. He cut an imposing figure in his Plate; he certainly looked much better in armor than he did wearing one of those ridiculous costumes of lace and silk that were popular these days.\r\nSadeas caught Dalinar\u2019s eyes, nodding slightly.\r\nMy part is done,that nod said. Sadeas strolled for a moment, then reentered the pavilion.\r\nSo. Sadeas had remembered the reason for inviting Vamah on the hunt. Dalinar would have to seek out Vamah. He made his way toward the pavilion. Adolin and Renarin lurked near the king. Had the lad given his report yet? It seemed likely that Adolin was trying\u2014yet again\u2014to listen in on Sadeas\u2019s conversations with the king. Dalinar would have to do something about that; the boy\u2019s personal rivalry with Sadeas was understandable, perhaps, but counterproductive.\r\nSadeas was chatting with the king. Dalinar made to go find Vamah\u2014the other highprince was near the back of the pavilion\u2014but the king interrupted him.\r\n\u201CDalinar,\u201D the king said. \u201CCome here. Sadeas tells me he has won three gemhearts in the last few weeks alone!\u201D\r\n\u201CHe has indeed,\u201D Dalinar said, approaching.\r\n\u201CHow many have you won?\u201D\r\n\u201CIncluding the one today?\u201D\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D the king said. \u201CBefore this.\u201D\r\n\u201CNone, Your Majesty,\u201D Dalinar admitted.\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s Sadeas\u2019s bridges,\u201D Elhokar said. \u201CThey\u2019re more efficient than yours.\u201D\r\n\u201CI may not have won anything the last few weeks,\u201D Dalinar said stiffly, \u201Cbut my army has won its share of skirmishes in the past.\u201D\r\nAnd the gemhearts can go to Damnation, for all I care.\r\n\u201CPerhaps,\u201D Elhokar said, \u201Cbut what have you done lately?\u201D\r\n\u201CI have been busy with other important things.\u201D\r\nSadeas raised an eyebrow. \u201CMore important than the war? More important than vengeance? Is that possible? Or are you just making excuses?\u201D\r\nDalinar gave the other highprince a pointed look. Sadeas just shrugged. They were allies, but they were\r\nnotfriends. Not any longer.\r\n\u201CYou should switch to bridges like his,\u201D Elhokar said.\r\n\u201CYour Majesty,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CSadeas\u2019s bridges waste many lives.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut they are also fast,\u201D Sadeas said smoothly. \u201CRelying on wheeled bridges is foolish, Dalinar. Getting them over this plateau terrain is slow and plodding.\u201D\r\n\u201CThe Codes state that a general may not ask a man to do anything he would not do himself. Tell me, Sadeas. Would\r\nyourun at the front of those bridges you use?\u201D\r\n\u201CI wouldn\u2019t eat gruel either,\u201D Sadeas said dryly, \u201Cor cut ditches.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut you might if you had to,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CThe bridges are different. Stormfather, you don\u2019t even let them use armor or shields! Would you enter combat without your Plate?\u201D\r\n\u201CThe bridgemen serve a very important function,\u201D Sadeas snapped. \u201CThey distract the Parshendi from firing at my soldiers. I tried giving them shields at first. And you know what? The Parshendi ignored the bridgemen and fired volleys onto my soldiers and horses. I found that by doubling the number of bridges on a run, then making them extremely light\u2014no armor, no shields to slow them\u2014the bridgemen work far better.\r\n\u201CYou see, Dalinar? The Parshendi are too tempted by the exposed bridgemen to fire at anyone else! Yes, we lose a few bridge crews in each assault, but rarely so many that it hinders us. The Parshendi just keep firing at them\u2014I assume that, for whatever reason, they think killing the bridgemen hurts us. As if an unarmored man carrying a bridge was worth the same to the army as a mounted knight in Plate.\u201D Sadeas shook his head in amusement at the thought.\r\nDalinar frowned.\r\nBrother,Gavilar had written.\r\nYou must find the most important words a man can say\u2026.A quote from the ancient text\r\nThe Way of Kings. It would disagree strongly with the things Sadeas was implying.\r\n\u201CRegardless,\u201D Sadeas continued. \u201CSurely you can\u2019t argue with how effective my method has been.\u201D\r\n\u201CSometimes,\u201D Dalinar said, \u201Cthe prize is not worth the costs. The means by which we achieve victory are as important as the victory itself.\u201D\r\nSadeas looked at Dalinar incredulously. Even Adolin and Renarin\u2014who had come closer\u2014seemed shocked by the statement. It was a very un-Alethi way of thinking.\r\nWith the visions and the words of that book spinning in his mind lately, Dalinar wasn\u2019t feeling particularly Alethi.\r\n\u201CThe prize is worth\r\nanycost, Brightlord Dalinar,\u201D Sadeas said. \u201CWinning the competition is worth any effort, any expense.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt is a war,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201C\r\nNota contest.\u201D\r\n\u201CEverything is a contest,\u201D Sadeas said with a wave of his hand. \u201CAll dealings among men are a contest in which some will succeed and others fail. And some are failing quite spectacularly.\u201D\r\n\u201CMy father is one of the most renowned warriors in Alethkar!\u201D Adolin snapped, butting into the group. The king raised an eyebrow at him, but otherwise stayed out of the conversation. \u201CYou saw what he did earlier, Sadeas, while you were hiding back by the pavilion with your bow. My father held off the beast. You\u2019re a cowa\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CAdolin!\u201D Dalinar said. That was going too far. \u201CRestrain yourself.\u201D\r\nAdolin clenched his jaw, hand to his side, as if itching to summon his Shardblade. Renarin stepped forward and gently placed a hand on Adolin\u2019s arm. Reluctantly, Adolin backed down.\r\nSadeas turned to Dalinar, smirking. \u201COne son can barely control himself, and the other is incompetent. This is your legacy, old friend?\u201D\r\n\u201CI am proud of them both, Sadeas, whatever you think.\u201D\r\n\u201CThe firebrand I can understand,\u201D Sadeas said. \u201CYou were once impetuous just like him. But the other one? You saw how he ran out onto the field today. He even forgot to draw his sword or bow! He\u2019s useless!\u201D\r\nRenarin flushed, looking down. Adolin snapped his head up. He thrust his hand to the side again, stepping forward toward Sadeas.\r\n\u201CAdolin!\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CI will handle this!\u201D\r\nAdolin looked at him, blue eyes alight with rage, but he did not summon his Blade.\r\nDalinar turned his attention to Sadeas, speaking very softly, very pointedly. \u201CSadeas. Surely I did not just hear you openly\u2014before the king\u2014call my son\r\nuseless. Surely you would not say that, as such an insult would\r\ndemandthat I summon my Blade and seek your blood. Shatter the Vengeance Pact. Cause the king\u2019s two greatest allies to kill one another. Surely you would not have been that foolish. Surely I misheard.\u201D\r\nEverything grew still. Sadeas hesitated. He didn\u2019t back down; he met Dalinar\u2019s gaze. But he did hesitate.\r\n\u201CPerhaps,\u201D Sadeas said slowly, \u201Cyou did hear the wrong words. I would not insult your son. That would not have been\u2026wise of me.\u201D\r\nAn understanding passed between them, stares locked, and Dalinar nodded. Sadeas did as well\u2014one curt nod of the head. They would not let their hatred of one another become a danger to the king. Barbs were one thing, but dueling offenses were another. They couldn\u2019t risk that.\r\n\u201CWell,\u201D Elhokar said. He allowed his highprinces to jostle and contend for status and influence. He believed they were all stronger for it, and few faulted him; it was an established method of rule. More and more, Dalinar found himself disagreeing.\r\nUnite them\u2026.\r\n\u201CI guess we can be done with that,\u201D Elhokar said.\r\nTo the side, Adolin looked unsatisfied, as if he\u2019d really been hoping that Dalinar would summon his Blade and confront Sadeas. Dalinar\u2019s own blood felt hot, the Thrill tempting him, but he shoved it down. No. Not here. Not now. Not while Elhokar needed them.\r\n\u201CPerhaps we can be done, Your Majesty,\u201D Sadeas said. \u201CThough I doubt this particular discussion between Dalinar and me will ever be done. At least until he relearns how to act as a man should.\u201D\r\n\u201CI said that is quite enough, Sadeas,\u201D Elhokar said.\r\n\u201CQuite enough, you say?\u201D a new voice added. \u201CI believe that a single word from Sadeas is \u2018quite enough\u2019 for anyone.\u201D Wit picked his way through the groups of attendants, holding a cup of wine in one hand, silver sword belted at his side.\r\n\u201CWit!\u201D Elhokar exclaimed. \u201CWhen did you get here?\u201D\r\n\u201CI caught up to your party just before the battle, Your Majesty,\u201D Wit said, bowing. \u201CI was going to speak with you, but the chasmfiend beat me to you. I hear your conversation with it was rather energizing.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut, you arrived hours ago, then! What have you been doing? How could I have missed seeing you here?\u201D\r\n\u201CI had\u2026things to be about,\u201D Wit said. \u201CBut I couldn\u2019t stay away from the hunt. I wouldn\u2019t want you to lack for me.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve done well so far.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd yet, you were still Witless,\u201D Wit noted.\r\nDalinar studied the black-clad man. What to make of Wit? He\r\nwasclever. And yet, he was too free with his thoughts, as he\u2019d shown with Renarin earlier. This Wit had a strange air about him that Dalinar couldn\u2019t quite place.\r\n\u201CBrightlord Sadeas,\u201D Wit said, taking a sip of wine. \u201CI\u2019m terribly sorry to see you here.\u201D\r\n\u201CI should think,\u201D Sadeas said dryly, \u201Cthat you would be happy to see me. I seem always to provide you with such entertainment.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat is unfortunately true,\u201D Wit said.\r\n\u201CUnfortunately?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes. You see, Sadeas, you make it too easy. An uneducated, half-brained serving boy with a hangover could make mock of you. I am left with no need to exert myself, and your very nature makes mockery of my mockery. And so it is that through sheer stupidity you make me look incompetent.\u201D\r\n\u201CReally, Elhokar,\u201D Sadeas said. \u201CMust we put up with this\u2026creature?\u201D\r\n\u201CI like him,\u201D Elhokar said, smiling. \u201CHe makes me laugh.\u201D\r\n\u201CAt the expense of those who are loyal to you.\u201D\r\n\u201CExpense?\u201D Wit cut in. \u201CSadeas, I don\u2019t believe you\u2019ve ever paid me a sphere. Though no, please, don\u2019t offer. I can\u2019t take your money, as I know how many others you\r\nmustpay to get what you wish of them.\u201D\r\nSadeas flushed, but kept his temper. \u201CA whore joke, Wit? Is that the best you can manage?\u201D\r\nWit shrugged. \u201CI point out truths when I see them, Brightlord Sadeas. Each man has his place. Mine is to make insults. Yours is to be in-sluts.\u201D\r\nSadeas froze, then grew red-faced. \u201CYou are a fool.\u201D\r\n\u201CIf the Wit is a fool, then it is a sorry state for men. I shall offer you this, Sadeas. If you can speak, yet say nothing ridiculous, I will leave you alone for the rest of the week.\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, I think that shouldn\u2019t be too difficult.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd yet you failed,\u201D Wit said, sighing. \u201CFor you said \u2018I think\u2019 and I can imagine nothing so ridiculous as the concept of\r\nyouthinking. What of you, young Prince Renarin? Your father wishes me to leave you alone. Can you speak, yet say nothing ridiculous?\u201D\r\nEyes turned toward Renarin, who stood just behind his brother. Renarin hesitated, eyes opening wide at the attention. Dalinar grew tense.\r\n\u201CNothing ridiculous,\u201D Renarin said slowly.\r\nWit laughed. \u201CYes, I suppose that will satisfy me. Very clever. If Brightlord Sadeas should lose control of himself and finally kill me, perhaps you can be King\u2019s Wit in my stead. You seem to have the mind for it.\u201D\r\nRenarin perked up, which darkened Sadeas\u2019s mood further. Dalinar eyed the highprince; Sadeas\u2019s hand had gone to his sword. Not a Shardblade, for Sadeas didn\u2019t have one. But he did carry a lighteyes\u2019s side sword. Plenty deadly; Dalinar had fought beside Sadeas on many occasions, and the man was an expert swordsman.\r\nWit stepped forward. \u201CSo what of it, Sadeas?\u201D he asked softly. \u201CYou going to do Alethkar a favor and rid it of us both?\u201D\r\nKilling the King\u2019s Wit was legal. But by so doing, Sadeas would forfeit his title and lands. Most men found it a poor enough trade not to do it in the open. Of course, if you could assassinate a Wit without anyone knowing it was you, that was something different.\r\nSadeas slowly removed his hand from the hilt of his sword, then nodded curtly to the king and strode away.\r\n\u201CWit,\u201D Elhokar said, \u201CSadeas has my favor. There\u2019s no need to torment him so.\u201D\r\n\u201CI disagree,\u201D Wit said. \u201CThe king\u2019s favor may be torment enough for most men, but not him.\u201D\r\nThe king sighed and looked toward Dalinar. \u201CI should go placate Sadeas. I\u2019ve been meaning to ask you, though. Have you looked into the issue I asked you about earlier?\u201D\r\nDalinar shook his head. \u201CI have been busy with the needs of the army. But I will look into it now, Your Majesty.\u201D\r\nThe king nodded, then hastened off after Sadeas.\r\n\u201CWhat was that, Father?\u201D Adolin asked. \u201CIs it about the people he thinks were spying on him?\u201D\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CThis is something new. I\u2019ll show you shortly.\u201D\r\nDalinar looked toward Wit. The black-clad man was popping his knuckles one at a time, looking at Sadeas, seeming contemplative. He noticed Dalinar watching and winked, then walked away.\r\n\u201CI\r\nlikehim,\u201D Adolin repeated.\r\n\u201CI might be persuaded to agree,\u201D Dalinar said, rubbing his chin. \u201CRenarin,\u201D Dalinar said, \u201Cgo and get a report on the wounded. Adolin, come with me. We need to check into the matter the king spoke of.\u201D\r\nBoth young men looked confused, but they did as requested. Dalinar started across the plateau toward where the carcass of the chasmfiend lay.\r\nLet us see what your worries have brought us this time, nephew,he thought.\r\nAdolin turned the long leather strap over in his hands. Almost a handspan wide and a finger\u2019s width thick, the strap ended in a ragged tear. It was the girth to the king\u2019s saddle, the strap that wrapped under the horse\u2019s barrel. It had broken suddenly during the fight, throwing the saddle\u2014and the king\u2014from horseback.\r\n\u201CWhat do you think?\u201D Dalinar asked.\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know,\u201D Adolin said. \u201CIt doesn\u2019t\r\nlookthat worn, but I guess it was, otherwise it wouldn\u2019t have snapped, right?\r\nDalinar took the strap back, looking contemplative. The soldiers still hadn\u2019t returned with the bridge crew, though the sky was darkening.\r\n\u201CFather,\u201D Adolin said. \u201CWhy would Elhokar ask us to look into this? Does he expect us to discipline the grooms for not properly caring for his saddle? Is it\u2026\u201D Adolin trailed off, and he suddenly understood his father\u2019s hesitation. \u201CThe king thinks the strap was cut, doesn\u2019t he?\u201D\r\nDalinar nodded. He turned it over in his gauntleted fingers, and Adolin could see him thinking about it. A girth could get so worn that it would snap, particularly when strained by the weight of a man in Shardplate. This strap had broken off at the point where it had been affixed to the saddle, so it would have been easy for the grooms to miss it. That was the most rational explanation. But when looked at with slightly more irrational eyes, it could seem that something nefarious had happened.\r\n\u201CFather,\u201D Adolin said, \u201Che\u2019s getting increasingly paranoid. You know he is.\u201D\r\nDalinar didn\u2019t reply.\r\n\u201CHe sees assassins in every shadow,\u201D Adolin continued. \u201CStraps break. That doesn\u2019t mean someone tried to kill him.\u201D\r\n\u201CIf the king is worried,\u201D Dalinar said, \u201Cwe should look into it. The break\r\nissmoother on one side, as if it were sliced so that it would rip when it was stressed.\u201D\r\nAdolin frowned. \u201CMaybe.\u201D He hadn\u2019t noticed that. \u201CBut think about it, Father. Why would someone cut his strap? A fall from horseback wouldn\u2019t harm a Shardbearer. If it was an assassination attempt, then it was an incompetent one.\u201D\r\n\u201CIf it was an assassination attempt,\u201D Dalinar said, \u201Ceven an incompetent one, then we have something to worry about. It happened on our watch, and his horse was cared for by our grooms. We will look into this.\u201D\r\nAdolin groaned, some of his frustration slipping out. \u201CThe others already whisper that we\u2019ve become bodyguards and pets of the king. What will they say if they hear that we\u2019re chasing down his every paranoid worry, no matter how irrational?\u201D\r\n\u201CI have never cared what they say.\u201D\r\n\u201CWe spend all our time on bureaucracy while others win wealth and glory. We rarely go on plateau assaults because we\u2019re busy doing things like\r\nthis! We need to be out there, fighting, if we\u2019re ever going to catch up to Sadeas!\u201D\r\nDalinar looked at him, frown deepening, and Adolin bit off his next outburst.\r\n\u201CI see that we\u2019re no longer talking about this broken girth,\u201D Dalinar said.\r\n\u201CI\u2026I\u2019m sorry. I spoke in haste.\u201D\r\n\u201CPerhaps you did. But then again, perhaps I needed to hear it. I noticed that you didn\u2019t particularly like how I held you back from Sadeas earlier.\u201D\r\n\u201CI know you hate him too, Father.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou do not know as much as you presume you do,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CWe\u2019ll do something about that in a moment. For now, I swear\u2026this strap\r\ndoeslook like it was cut. Perhaps there is something we\u2019re not seeing. This could have been part of something larger that didn\u2019t work the way it had been anticipated.\u201D\r\nAdolin hesitated. It seemed overcomplicated, but if there was a group who liked their plots overly complicated, it was the Alethi lighteyes. \u201CDo you think one of the highprinces may have tried something?\u201D\r\n\u201CMaybe,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CBut I doubt any of them want him dead. So long as Elhokar rules, the highprinces get to fight in this war their way and fatten their purses. He doesn\u2019t make many demands of them. They like having him as their king.\u201D\r\n\u201CMen can covet the throne for the distinction alone.\u201D\r\n\u201CTrue. When we return, see if anyone has been bragging too much of late. Check to see if Roion is still bitter about Wit\u2019s insult at the feast last week and have Talata go over the contracts Highprince Bethab offered to the king for the use of his chulls. In previous contracts, he\u2019s tried to slip in language that would favor his claim in a succession. He\u2019s been bold ever since your aunt Navani left.\u201D\r\nAdolin nodded.\r\n\u201CSee if you can backtrack the girth\u2019s history,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CHave a leatherworker look at it and tell you what he thinks of the rip. Ask the grooms if they noticed anything, and watch to see if any have received any suspicious windfalls of spheres lately.\u201D He hesitated. \u201CAnd double the king\u2019s guard.\u201D\r\nAdolin turned, glancing at the pavilion. Sadeas was strolling out of it. Adolin narrowed his eyes. \u201CDo you think\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D Dalinar interrupted.\r\n\u201CSadeas is an eel.\u201D\r\n\u201CSon, you\r\nhaveto stop fixating on him. He likes Elhokar, which can\u2019t be said of most of the others. He\u2019s one of the few I\u2019d trust the king\u2019s safety to.\u201D\r\n\u201CI wouldn\u2019t do the same, Father, I can tell you that.\u201D\r\nDalinar fell silent for a moment. \u201CCome with me.\u201D He handed Adolin the saddle strap, then began to cross the plateau toward the pavilion. \u201CI want to show you something about Sadeas.\u201D\r\nResigned, Adolin followed. They passed the lit pavilion. Inside, darkeyed men served food and drink while women sat and scribed messages or wrote accounts of the battle. The lighteyes spoke with one another in verbose, excited tones, complimenting the king\u2019s bravery. The men wore dark, masculine colors: maroon, navy, forest green, deep burnt orange.\r\nDalinar approached Highprince Vamah, who stood outside the pavilion with a group of his own lighteyed attendants. He was dressed in a fashionable long brown coat that had slashes cut through it to expose the bright yellow silk lining. It was a subdued fashion, not as ostentatious as wearing silks on the outside. Adolin thought it looked nice.\r\nVamah himself was a round-faced, balding man. The short hair that remained stuck straight up, and he had light grey eyes. He had a habit of squinting\u2014which he did as Dalinar and Adolin approached.\r\nWhat is this about?Adolin wondered.\r\n\u201CBrightlord,\u201D Dalinar said to Vamah. \u201CI have come to make certain your comfort has been seen to.\u201D\r\n\u201CMy comfort would be\r\nbestseen to if we could be on our way back.\u201D Vamah glared over at the setting sun, as if blaming it for some misdeed. He wasn\u2019t normally so foul-mooded.\r\n\u201CI\u2019m certain that my men are moving as quickly as they can,\u201D Dalinar said.\r\n\u201CIt wouldn\u2019t be nearly as late if you hadn\u2019t slowed us so much on the way here,\u201D Vamah said.\r\n\u201CI like to be careful,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CAnd, speaking of care, there is something I\u2019ve been meaning to talk to you about. Might my son and I speak to you alone for a moment?\u201D\r\nVamah scowled, but let Dalinar lead him away from his attendants. Adolin followed, more and more baffled.\r\n\u201CThe beast was a large one,\u201D Dalinar said to Vamah, nodding toward the fallen chasmfiend. \u201CThe biggest I\u2019ve seen.\u201D\r\n\u201CI suppose.\u201D\r\n\u201CI hear you\u2019ve had success on your recent plateau assaults, killing a few cocooned chasmfiends of your own. You are to be congratulated.\u201D\r\nVamah shrugged. \u201CThe ones we won were small. Nothing like that gemheart that Elhokar took today.\u201D\r\n\u201CA small gemheart is better than none,\u201D Dalinar said politely. \u201CI hear that you have plans to augment the walls of your warcamp.\u201D\r\n\u201CHum? Yes. Fill in a few of the gaps, improve the fortification.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll be certain to tell His Majesty that you\u2019ll be wanting to purchase extra access to the Soulcasters.\u201D\r\nVamah turned to him, frowning. \u201CSoulcasters?\u201D\r\n\u201CFor lumber,\u201D Dalinar said evenly. \u201CSurely you don\u2019t intend to fill in the walls without using scaffolding? Out here, on these remote plains, it\u2019s fortunate that we have Soulcasters to provide things like wood, wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201D\r\n\u201CEr, yes,\u201D Vamah said, expression darkening further. Adolin looked from him to his father. There was a subtext to the conversation. Dalinar wasn\u2019t speaking only of wood for the walls\u2014the Soulcasters were the means by which all of the highprinces fed their armies.\r\n\u201CThe king is quite generous in allowing access to the Soulcasters,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CWouldn\u2019t you agree, Vamah?\u201D\r\n\u201CI take your point, Dalinar,\u201D Vamah said dryly. \u201CNo need to keep bashing the rock into my face.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve never been known as a subtle man, Brightlord,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CJust an effective one.\u201D He walked away, waving for Adolin to follow. Adolin did so, looking over his shoulder at the other highprince.\r\n\u201CHe\u2019s been complaining vocally about the fees that Elhokar charges to use his Soulcasters,\u201D Dalinar said softly. It was the primary form of taxation the king levied on the highprinces. Elhokar himself didn\u2019t fight for, or win, gemhearts except on the occasional hunt. He stood aloof from fighting personally in the war, as was appropriate.\r\n\u201CAnd so\u2026?\u201D Adolin said.\r\n\u201CSo I reminded Vamah of how much he relies on the king.\u201D\r\n\u201CI suppose that\u2019s important. But what does it have to do with Sadeas?\u201D\r\nDalinar didn\u2019t answer. He kept walking across the plateau, stepping up to the lip of the chasm. Adolin joined him, waiting. A few seconds later, someone approached from behind in clinking Shardplate, then Sadeas stepped up beside Dalinar at the lip of the chasm. Adolin narrowed his eyes at the man, and Sadeas raised an eyebrow, but said nothing about his presence.\r\n\u201CDalinar,\u201D Sadeas said, turning his eyes forward, looking out across the Plains.\r\n\u201CSadeas.\u201D Dalinar\u2019s voice was controlled and curt.\r\n\u201CYou spoke with Vamah?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes. He saw through what I was doing.\u201D\r\n\u201COf course he did.\u201D There was a hint of amusement in Sadeas\u2019s voice. \u201CI wouldn\u2019t have expected anything else.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou told him you were increasing what you charge him for wood?\u201D\r\nSadeas controlled the only large forest in the region. \u201CDoubling it,\u201D Sadeas said.\r\nAdolin looked over his shoulder. Vamah was watching them stand there, and his expression was as thunderous as a highstorm, angerspren boiling up from the ground around him like small pools of bubbling blood. Dalinar and Sadeas together sent him a very sound message.\r\nWhy\u2026this is probably why they invited him on the hunt,Adolin realized.\r\nSo they could maneuver him.\r\n\u201CWill it work?\u201D Dalinar asked.\r\n\u201CI\u2019m certain it will,\u201D Sadeas said. \u201CVamah\u2019s an agreeable enough fellow, when prodded\u2014he\u2019ll see that it\u2019s better to use the Soulcasters than spend a fortune running a supply line back to Alethkar.\u201D\r\n\u201CPerhaps we should tell the king about these sorts of things,\u201D Dalinar said, glancing at the king, who stood in the pavilion, oblivious of what had been done.\r\nSadeas sighed. \u201CI\u2019ve tried; he hasn\u2019t a mind for this sort of work. Leave the boy to his preoccupations, Dalinar. His are the grand ideals of justice, holding the sword high as he rides against his father\u2019s enemies.\u201D\r\n\u201CLately, he seems less preoccupied with the Parshendi, and more worried about assassins in the night,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CThe boy\u2019s paranoia worries me. I don\u2019t know where he gets it.\u201D\r\nSadeas laughed. \u201CDalinar, are you\r\nserious?\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m always serious.\u201D\r\n\u201CI know, I know. But surely you can see where the boy comes by the paranoia!\u201D\r\n\u201CFrom the way his father was killed?\u201D\r\n\u201CFrom the way his uncle treats him! A thousand guards? Halts on each and every plateau to let soldiers \u2018secure\u2019 the next one over? Really, Dalinar?\u201D\r\n\u201CI like to be careful.\u201D\r\n\u201COthers call that being paranoid.\u201D\r\n\u201CThe Codes\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CThe Codes are a bunch of idealized nonsense,\u201D Sadeas said, \u201Cdevised by poets to describe the way they think things\r\nshouldhave been.\u201D\r\n\u201CGavilar believed in them.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd look where it got him.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd where were you, Sadeas, when he was fighting for his life?\u201D\r\nSadeas\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201CSo we\u2019re going to rehash that now? Like old lovers, crossing paths unexpectedly at a feast?\u201D\r\nAdolin\u2019s father didn\u2019t reply. Once again, Adolin found himself baffled by Dalinar\u2019s relationship with Sadeas. Their barbs were genuine; one needed only look in their eyes to see that the men could barely stand one another.\r\nAnd yet, here they were, apparently planning and executing a joint manipulation of another highprince.\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll protect the boy my way,\u201D Sadeas said. \u201CYou do it your way. But don\u2019t complain to me about his paranoia when you insist on wearing your uniform to bed, just in case the Parshendi suddenly decide\u2014against all reason and precedent\u2014to attack the warcamps. \u2018I don\u2019t know where he gets it\u2019 indeed!\u201D\r\n\u201CLet\u2019s go, Adolin,\u201D Dalinar said, turning to stride away. Adolin followed.\r\n\u201CDalinar,\u201D Sadeas called from behind.\r\nDalinar hesitated, looking back.\r\n\u201CHave you found it yet?\u201D Sadeas asked. \u201CWhy he wrote what he did?\u201D\r\nDalinar shook his head.\r\n\u201CYou\u2019re not going to find the answer,\u201D Sadeas said. \u201CIt\u2019s a foolish quest, old friend. One that\u2019s tearing you apart. I know what happens to you during storms. Your mind is unraveling because of all this stress you put upon yourself.\u201D\r\nDalinar returned to walking away. Adolin hurried after him. What had that last part been about? Why \u201Che\u201D wrote? Men didn\u2019t write. Adolin opened his mouth to ask, but he could sense his father\u2019s mood. This was not a time to prod him.\r\nHe walked with Dalinar up to a small rock hill on the plateau. They picked their way up it to the top, and from there looked out at the fallen chasmfiend. Dalinar\u2019s men continued harvesting its meat and carapace.\r\nHe and his father stood there for a time, Adolin brimming with questions, yet unable to find a way to phrase them.\r\nEventually, Dalinar spoke. \u201CHave I ever told you what Gavilar\u2019s final words to me were?\u201D\r\n\u201CYou haven\u2019t. I\u2019ve always wondered about that night.\u201D\r\n\u201C\u2018Brother, follow the Codes tonight. There is something strange upon the winds.\u2019 That\u2019s what he said to me, the last thing he told me just before we began the treaty-signing celebration.\u201D\r\n\u201CI didn\u2019t realize that Uncle Gavilar followed the Codes.\u201D\r\n\u201CHe\u2019s the one who first showed them to me. He found them as a relic of old Alethkar, back when we\u2019d first been united. He began following them shortly before he died.\u201D Dalinar grew hesitant. \u201CThose were odd days, son. Jasnah and I weren\u2019t sure what to think of the changes in Gavilar. At the time, I thought the Codes foolishness, even the one that commanded an officer to avoid strong drink during times of war. Especially that one.\u201D His voice grew even softer. \u201CI was unconscious on the ground when Gavilar was murdered. I can remember voices, trying to wake me up, but I was too addled by my wine. I should have been there for him.\u201D\r\nHe looked to Adolin. \u201CI cannot live in the past. It is foolishness to do so. I blame myself for Gavilar\u2019s death, but there is nothing to be done for him now.\u201D\r\nAdolin nodded.\r\n\u201CSon, I keep hoping that if I make you follow the Codes long enough, you will see\u2014as I have\u2014their importance. Hopefully you will not need as dramatic an example of it as I did. Regardless, you need to understand. You speak of Sadeas, of beating him, of competing with him. Do you know of Sadeas\u2019s part in my brother\u2019s death?\u201D\r\n\u201CHe was the decoy,\u201D Adolin said. Sadeas, Gavilar, and Dalinar had been good friends up until the king\u2019s death. Everyone knew it. They had conquered Alethkar together.\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CHe was with the king and heard the soldiers crying that a Shardbearer was attacking. The decoy idea was Sadeas\u2019s plan\u2014he put on one of Gavilar\u2019s robes and fled in Gavilar\u2019s place. It was suicide, what he did. Wearing no Plate, making a Shardbearer assassin chase him. I honestly think it was one of the bravest things I\u2019ve ever known a man to do.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut it failed.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes. And there\u2019s a part of me that can never forgive Sadeas for that failure. I know it\u2019s irrational, but he should have\r\nbeenthere, with Gavilar. Just like I should have been. We both failed our king, and we cannot forgive one another. But the two of us are still united in one thing. We made a vow on that day. We\u2019d protect Gavilar\u2019s son. No matter what the cost, no matter what other things came between us,\r\nwe would protect Elhokar.\r\n\u201CAnd so that\u2019s why I\u2019m here on these Plains. It isn\u2019t wealth or glory. I care nothing for those things, not any longer. I came for the brother I loved, and for the nephew I love in his own right. And, in a way, this is what divides Sadeas and me even as it unites us. Sadeas thinks that the best way to protect Elhokar is to kill the Parshendi. He drives himself, and his men, brutally, to get to those plateaus and fight. I believe a part of him thinks I\u2019m breaking my vow by not doing the same.\r\n\u201CBut that\u2019s not the way to protect Elhokar. He needs a stable throne, allies that support him, not highprinces that bicker. Making a strong Alethkar will protect him better than killing our enemies will. This was Gavilar\u2019s life\u2019s work, uniting the highprinces\u2026\u201D\r\nHe trailed off. Adolin waited for more, but it did not come.\r\n\u201CSadeas,\u201D Adolin finally said. \u201CI\u2019m\u2026surprised to hear you call him brave.\u201D\r\n\u201CHe\r\nisbrave. And cunning. Sometimes, I make the mistake of letting his extravagant dress and mannerisms lead me to underestimate him. But there\u2019s a good man inside of him, son. He is not our enemy. We can be petty sometimes, the two of us. But he works to protect Elhokar, so I ask you to respect that.\u201D\r\nHow did one respond to that?\r\nYou hate him, but you ask me not to?\u201CAll right,\u201D Adolin said. \u201CI\u2019ll watch myself around him. But, Father, I still don\u2019t trust him. Please. At least consider the possibility that he\u2019s not as committed as you are, that he\u2019s playing you.\u201D\r\n\u201CVery well,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CI\u2019ll consider it.\u201D\r\nAdolin nodded. It was something. \u201CWhat of what he said at the end? Something about writing?\u201D\r\nDalinar hesitated. \u201CIt is a secret he and I share. Other than us, only Jasnah and Elhokar know of it. I\u2019ve contemplated for a time whether I should tell you, as you will take my place should I fall. I spoke to you of the last words my brother said to me.\u201D\r\n\u201CAsking you to follow the Codes.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes. But there is more. Something else he said to me, but not with spoken words. Instead, these are words that\u2026he wrote.\u201D\r\n\u201CGavilar could\r\nwrite?\u201D\r\n\u201CWhen Sadeas discovered the king\u2019s body, he found words written on the fragment of a board, using Gavilar\u2019s own blood. \u2018Brother,\u2019 they said. \u2018You must find the most important words a man can say.\u2019 Sadeas hid the fragment away, and we later had Jasnah read the words. If it is true that he could write\u2014and other possibilities seem implausible\u2014it was a shameful secret he hide. As I said, his actions grew very odd near the end of his life.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd what does it mean? Those words?\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s a quote,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CFrom an ancient book called\r\nThe Way of Kings. Gavilar favored readings from the volume near the end of his life\u2014he spoke to me of it often. I didn\u2019t realize the quote was from it until recently; Jasnah discovered it for me. I\u2019ve now had the text of the book read to me a few times, but so far, I find nothing to explain why he wrote what he did.\u201D He paused. \u201CThe book was used by the Radiants as a kind of guidebook, a book of counsel on how to live their lives.\u201D\r\nThe Radiants?\r\nStormfather!Adolin thought. The delusions his father had\u2026they often seemed to have something to do with the Radiants. This was further proof that the delusions were related to Dalinar\u2019s guilt over his brother\u2019s death.\r\nBut what could Adolin do to help?\r\nMetal footsteps ground on the rock behind. Adolin turned, then nodded in respect as the king approached, still wearing his golden Shardplate, though he\u2019d removed the helm. He was several years Adolin\u2019s senior, and had a bold face with a prominent nose. Some said they saw in him a kingly air and a regal bearing, and women Adolin trusted had confided that they found the king quite handsome.\r\nNot as handsome as Adolin, of course. But still handsome.\r\nThe king was married, however; his wife the queen managed his affairs back in Alethkar. \u201CUncle,\u201D Elhokar said. \u201CCan we not be on our way? I\u2019m certain that we Shardbearers could leap the chasm. You and I could be back at the warcamps shortly.\u201D\r\n\u201CI will not leave my men, Your Majesty,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CAnd I doubt you want to be running across the plateaus for several hours alone, exposed, without proper guards.\u201D\r\n\u201CI suppose,\u201D the king said. \u201CEither way, I did want to thank you for your bravery today. It appears that I owe you my life yet again.\u201D\r\n\u201CKeeping you alive is something else I try very hard to make a habit, Your Majesty.\u201D\r\n\u201CI am glad for it. Have you looked into the item I asked you about?\u201D He nodded to the girth, which Adolin realized he was still carrying in a gauntleted hand.\r\n\u201CI did,\u201D Dalinar said.\r\n\u201CWell?\u201D\r\n\u201CWe couldn\u2019t decide, Your Majesty,\u201D Dalinar said, taking the strap and handing it to the king. \u201CIt\r\nmayhave been cut. The tear is smoother along one side. Like it was weakened so that it would rip.\u201D\r\n\u201CI knew it!\u201D Elhokar held the strap up and inspected it.\r\n\u201CWe are not leatherworkers, Your Majesty,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CWe need to give both sides of the strap to experts and get their opinions. I have instructed Adolin to look into the matter further.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\r\nwascut,\u201D Elhokar said. \u201CI can see it clearly, right here. I keep telling you, Uncle. Someone is trying to kill me. They want me, just like they wanted my father.\u201D\r\n\u201CSurely you don\u2019t think the\r\nParshendidid this,\u201D Dalinar said, sounding shocked.\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know\r\nwhodid it. Perhaps someone on this very hunt.\u201D\r\nAdolin frowned. What was Elhokar implying? The majority of the people on this hunt were Dalinar\u2019s men.\r\n\u201CYour Majesty,\u201D Dalinar said frankly, \u201Cwe\r\nwilllook into the matter. But you have to be prepared to accept that this might have just been an accident.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou don\u2019t believe me,\u201D Elhokar said flatly. \u201CYou\r\nneverbelieve me.\u201D\r\nDalinar took a deep breath, and Adolin could see that his father had to struggle to keep his temper. \u201CI\u2019m\r\nnotsaying that. Even a potential threat to your life worries me very much. But I\r\ndosuggest that you avoid leaping to conclusions. Adolin has pointed out that this would be a terribly clumsy way to try to kill you. A fall from horseback isn\u2019t a serious threat to a man wearing Plate.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes, but during a hunt?\u201D Elhokar said. \u201CPerhaps they wanted the chasmfiend to kill me.\u201D\r\n\u201CWe weren\u2019t supposed to be in danger from the hunt,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CWe were\r\nsupposedto pelt the greatshell from a distance, then ride up and butcher it.\u201D\r\nElhokar narrowed his eyes, looking at Dalinar, then at Adolin. It was almost as if the king were suspicious of\r\nthem. The look was gone in a second. Had Adolin imagined it?\r\nStormfather!he thought.\r\nFrom behind, Vamah began calling to the king. Elhokar glanced at him and nodded. \u201CThis isn\u2019t over, Uncle,\u201D he said to Dalinar. \u201CLook into that strap.\u201D\r\n\u201CI will.\u201D\r\nThe king handed the strap back, then left, armor clinking.\r\n\u201CFather,\u201D Adolin said immediately, \u201Cdid you see\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll speak to him about it,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CSometime when he isn\u2019t so worked up.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CI will speak to him, Adolin. You look into that strap. And go gather your men.\u201D He nodded toward something in the distant west. \u201CI think I see that bridge crew coming.\u201D\r\nFinally, Adolin thought, following his gaze. A small group of figures was crossing the plateau in the distance, bearing Dalinar\u2019s banner and leading a bridge crew carrying one of Sadeas\u2019s mobile bridges. They\u2019d sent for one of those, as they were faster than Dalinar\u2019s larger, chull-pulled bridges.\r\nAdolin hurried off to give the orders, though he found himself distracted by his father\u2019s words, Gavilar\u2019s final message, and now the king\u2019s look of distrust. It seemed he would have plenty to preoccupy his mind on the long ride back to the camps.\r\nDalinar watched Adolin rush away to do as ordered. The lad\u2019s breastplate still bore a web of cracks, though it had stopped leaking Stormlight. With time, the armor would repair itself. It could reform even if it was completely shattered.\r\nThe lad liked to complain, but he was as good a son as a man could ask for. Fiercely loyal, with initiative and a strong sense of command. The soldiers liked him. Perhaps he was a little too friendly with them, but that could be forgiven. Even his hotheadedness could be forgiven, assuming he learned to channel it.\r\nDalinar left the young man to his work and went to check on Gallant. He found the Ryshadium with the grooms, who had set up a horse picket on the southern side of the plateau. They had bandaged the horse\u2019s scrapes, and he was no longer favoring his leg.\r\nDalinar patted the large stallion on the neck, looking into those deep black eyes. The horse seemed ashamed. \u201CIt wasn\u2019t your fault you threw me, Gallant,\u201D Dalinar said in a soothing voice. \u201CI\u2019m just glad you weren\u2019t harmed too badly.\u201D He turned to a nearby groom. \u201CGive him extra feed this evening, and two crispmelons.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes sir, Brightlord. But he won\u2019t eat extra food. He never does if we try to give it to him.\u201D\r\n\u201CHe\u2019ll eat it tonight,\u201D Dalinar said, patting the Ryshadium\u2019s neck again. \u201CHe only eats it when he feels he deserves it, son.\u201D\r\nThe lad seemed confused. Like most of them, he thought of Ryshadium as just another breed of horse. A man couldn\u2019t really understand until he\u2019d had one accept him as rider. It was like wearing Shardplate, an experience that was completely indescribable.\r\n\u201CYou\u2019ll eat both of those crispmelons,\u201D Dalinar said, pointing at the horse. \u201CYou deserve them.\u201D\r\nGallant blustered.\r\n\u201CYou\r\ndo,\u201D Dalinar said. The horse nickered, seeming content. Dalinar checked the leg, then nodded to the groom. \u201CTake good care of him, son. I\u2019ll ride another horseback.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes, Brightlord.\u201D\r\nThey got him a mount\u2014a sturdy, dust-colored mare. He was extra careful when he swung into the saddle. Ordinary horses always seemed so fragile to him.\r\nThe king rode out after the first squad of troops, Wit at his side. Sadeas, Dalinar noted, rode behind, where Wit couldn\u2019t get at him.\r\nThe bridge crew waited silently, resting as the king and his procession crossed. Like most of Sadeas\u2019s bridge crews, this one was constructed from a jumble of human refuse. Foreigners, deserters, thieves, murderers, and slaves. Many probably deserved their punishment, but the frightful way Sadeas chewed through them put Dalinar on edge. How long would it be before he could no longer fill the bridge crews with the suitably expendable? Did any man, even a murderer, deserve such a fate?\r\nA passage from\r\nThe Way of Kingscame to Dalinar\u2019s head unbidden. He\u2019d been listening to readings from the book more often than he\u2019d represented to Adolin.\r\nI once saw a spindly man carrying a stone larger than his head upon his back,the passage went.\r\nHe stumbled beneath the weight, shirtless under the sun, wearing only a loincloth. He tottered down a busy thoroughfare. People made way for him. Not because they sympathized with him, but because they feared the momentum of his steps. You dare not impede one such as this.\r\nThe monarch is like this man, stumbling along, the weight of a kingdom on his shoulders. Many give way before him, but so few are willing to step in and help carry the stone. They do not wish to attach themselves to the work, lest they condemn themselves to a life full of extra burdens.\r\nI left my carriage that day and took up the stone, lifting it for the man. I believe my guards were embarrassed. One can ignore a poor shirtless wretch doing such labor, but none ignore a king sharing the load. Perhaps we should switch places more often. If a king is seen to assume the burden of the poorest of men, perhaps there will be those who will help him with his own load, so invisible, yet so daunting.\r\nDalinar was shocked that he could remember the story word for word, though he probably shouldn\u2019t have been. In searching for the meaning behind Gavilar\u2019s last message, he\u2019d listened to readings from the book almost every day of the last few months.\r\nHe\u2019d been disappointed to find that there was no clear meaning behind the quote Gavilar had left. He\u2019d continued to listen anyway, though he tried to keep his interest quiet. The book did not have a good reputation, and not just because it was associated with the Lost Radiants. Stories of a king doing the work of a menial laborer were the least of its discomforting passages. In other places, it outright said that lighteyes were\r\nbeneathdarkeyes. That contradicted Vorin teachings.\r\nYes, best to keep this quiet. Dalinar had spoken truly when he\u2019d told Adolin he didn\u2019t care what people said about him. But when the rumors impeded his ability to protect Elhokar, they could become dangerous. He had to be careful.\r\nHe turned his mount and clopped up onto the bridge, then nodded his thanks to the bridgemen. They were the lowest in the army, and yet they bore the weight of kings."

      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\nSEVEN AND A HALF YEARS AGO\r\n\u201CHe wants to send me to Kharbranth,\u201D Kal said, perched atop his rock. \u201CTo train to become a surgeon.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat,\r\nreally?\u201D Laral asked, as she walked across the edge of the rock just in front of him. She had golden streaks in her otherwise black hair. She wore it long, and it streamed out behind her in a gust of wind as she balanced, hands out to the sides.\r\nThe hair was distinctive. But, of course, her eyes were more so. Bright, pale green. So different from the browns and blacks of the townspeople. There really\r\nwassomething different about being a lighteyes.\r\n\u201CYes, really,\u201D Kal said with a grunt. \u201CHe\u2019s been talking about it for a couple of years now.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd you didn\u2019t tell me?\u201D\r\nKal shrugged. He and Laral were atop a low ridge of boulders to the east of Hearthstone. Tien, his younger brother, was picking through rocks at the base. To Kal\u2019s right, a grouping of shallow hillsides rolled to the west. They were sprinkled with lavis polyps, a planting halfway to being harvested.\r\nHe felt oddly sad as he looked over those hillsides, filled with working men. The dark brown polyps would grow like melons filled with grain. After being dried, that grain would feed the entire town and their highprince\u2019s armies. The ardents who passed through town were careful to explain that the Calling of a farmer was a noble one, one of the highest save for the Calling of a soldier. Kal\u2019s father whispered under his breath that he saw far more honor in feeding the kingdom than he did in fighting and dying in useless wars.\r\n\u201CKal?\u201D Laral said, voice insistent. \u201CWhy didn\u2019t you\r\ntellme?\u201D\r\n\u201CSorry,\u201D he said. \u201CI wasn\u2019t sure if Father was serious or not. So I didn\u2019t say anything.\u201D\r\nThat was a lie. He\u2019d known his father was serious. Kal just hadn\u2019t wanted to mention leaving to become a surgeon, particularly not to Laral.\r\nShe placed her hands on her hips. \u201CI thought you were going to go become a soldier.\u201D\r\nKal shrugged.\r\nShe rolled her eyes, hopping down off her ridge onto a stone beside him. \u201CDon\u2019t you want to become a lighteyes? Win a Shardblade?\u201D\r\n\u201CFather says that doesn\u2019t happen very often.\u201D\r\nShe knelt down before him. \u201CI\u2019m sure\r\nyoucould do it.\u201D Those eyes, so bright and alive, shimmering green, the color of life itself.\r\nMore and more, Kal found that he liked looking at Laral. Kal knew, logically, what was happening to him. His father had explained the process of growing with the precision of a surgeon. But there was so much\r\nfeelinginvolved, emotions that his father\u2019s sterile descriptions hadn\u2019t explained. Some of those emotions were about Laral and the other girls of the town. Other emotions had to do with the strange blanket of melancholy that smothered him at times when he wasn\u2019t expecting.\r\n\u201CI\u2026\u201D Kal said.\r\n\u201CLook,\u201D Laral said, standing up again and climbing atop her rock. Her fine yellow dress ruffled in the wind. One more year, and she\u2019d start wearing a glove on her left hand, the mark that a girl had entered adolescence. \u201CUp, come on. Look.\u201D\r\nKal hauled himself to his feet, looking eastward. There, snarlbrush grew in dense thickets around the bases of stout markel trees.\r\n\u201CWhat do you see?\u201D Laral demanded.\r\n\u201CBrown snarlbrush. Looks like it\u2019s probably dead.\u201D\r\n\u201CThe Origin is out there,\u201D she said, pointing. \u201CThis is the stormlands. Father says we\u2019re here to be a windbreak for more timid lands to the west.\u201D She turned to him. \u201CWe\u2019ve got a noble heritage, Kal, darkeyes and light-eyes alike. That\u2019s why the best warriors have always been from Alethkar. Highprince Sadeas, General Amaram\u2026King Gavilar himself.\u201D\r\n\u201CI suppose.\u201D\r\nShe sighed exaggeratedly. \u201CI\r\nhatetalking to you when you\u2019re like this, you know.\u201D\r\n\u201CLike what?\u201D\r\n\u201CLike you are now. You know. Moping around, sighing.\u201D\r\n\u201C\r\nYou\u2019rethe one who just sighed, Laral.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou know what I mean.\u201D\r\nShe stepped down from the rock, walking over to go pout. She did that sometimes. Kal stayed where he was, looking eastward. He wasn\u2019t sure how he felt. His father really wanted him to be a surgeon, but he wavered. It wasn\u2019t just because of the stories, the excitement and wonder of them. He felt that by being a soldier, he could change things. Really change them. A part of him dreamed of going to war, of protecting Alethkar, of fighting alongside heroic lighteyes. Of doing good someplace other than a little town that nobody important ever visited.\r\nHe sat down. Sometimes he dreamed like that. Other times, he found it hard to care about anything. His dreary feelings were like a black eel, coiled inside of him. The snarlbrush out there survived the storms by growing together densely about the bases of the mighty markel trees. Their bark was coated with stone, their branches thick as a man\u2019s leg. But now the snarlbrush was dead. It hadn\u2019t survived. Pulling together hadn\u2019t been enough for it.\r\n\u201CKaladin?\u201D a voice asked from behind him.\r\nHe turned to find Tien. Tien was ten years old, two years Kal\u2019s junior, though he looked much younger. While other kids called him a runt, Lirin said that Tien just hadn\u2019t hit his height yet. But, well, with those round, flushed cheeks and that slight build, Tien\r\ndidlook like a boy half his age. \u201CKaladin,\u201D he said, eyes wide, hands cupped together. \u201CWhat are you looking at?\u201D\r\n\u201CDead weeds,\u201D Kal said.\r\n\u201COh. Well, you\r\nneedto see this.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat is it?\u201D\r\nTien opened his hands to reveal a small stone, weathered on all sides but with a jagged break on the bottom. Kal picked it up, looking it over. He couldn\u2019t see anything distinctive about it at all. In fact, it was dull.\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s just a rock,\u201D Kal said.\r\n\u201CNot\r\njusta rock,\u201D Tien said, taking out his canteen. He wetted his thumb, then rubbed it on the flat side of the stone. The wetness darkened the stone, and made visible an array of white patterns in the rock. \u201CSee?\u201D Tien asked, handing it back.\r\nThe strata of the rock alternated white, brown, black. The pattern was remarkable. Of course, it\r\nwasstill just a rock. But for some reason, Kal found himself smiling. \u201CThat\u2019s nice, Tien.\u201D He moved to hand the rock back.\r\nTien shook his head. \u201CI found it for you. To make you feel better.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2026\u201D It was just a stupid rock. Yet, inexplicably, Kal\r\ndidfeel better. \u201CThanks. Hey, you know what? I\u2019ll bet there\u2019s a lurg or two hiding in these rocks somewhere. Want to see if we can find one?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes, yes, yes!\u201D Tien said. He laughed and began moving down the rocks. Kal moved to follow, but paused, remembering something his father had said.\r\nHe poured some water on his hand from his own canteen and flung it at the brown snarlbrush. Wherever sprayed droplets fell, the brush grew instantly green, as if he were throwing paint. The brush wasn\u2019t dead; it just dried out, waiting for the storms to come. Kal watched the patches of green slowly fade back to tan as the water was absorbed.\r\n\u201CKaladin!\u201D Tien yelled. He often used Kal\u2019s full name, even though Kal had asked him not to. \u201CIs this one?\u201D\r\nKal moved down across the boulders, pocketing the rock he\u2019d been given. As he did so, he passed Laral. She was looking westward, toward her family\u2019s mansion. Her father was the citylord of Hearthstone. Kal found his eyes lingering on her again. That hair of hers was beautiful, with the two stark colors.\r\nShe turned to Kal and frowned.\r\n\u201CWe\u2019re going to hunt some lurgs,\u201D he explained, smiling and gesturing toward Tien. \u201CCome on.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou\u2019re cheerful suddenly.\u201D\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know. I feel better.\u201D\r\n\u201CHow does he do that? I wonder.\u201D\r\n\u201CWho does what?\u201D\r\n\u201CYour brother,\u201D Laral said, looking toward Tien. \u201CHe changes you.\u201D\r\nTien\u2019s head popped up behind some stones and he waved eagerly, bouncing up and down with excitement.\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s just hard to be gloomy when he\u2019s around,\u201D Kal said. \u201CCome on. Do you want to watch the lurg or not?\u201D\r\n\u201CI suppose,\u201D Laral said with a sigh. She held out a hand toward him.\r\n\u201CWhat\u2019s that for?\u201D Kal asked, looking at her hand.\r\n\u201CTo help me down.\u201D\r\n\u201CLaral, you\u2019re a better climber than me\r\norTien. You don\u2019t need help.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s polite, stupid,\u201D she said, proffering her hand more insistently. Kal sighed and took it, then she proceeded to hop down without even leaning on it or needing his help.\r\nShe,he thought,\r\nhas been acting very strange lately.\r\nThe two of them joined Tien, who jumped down into a hollow between some boulders. The younger boy pointed eagerly. A silky patch of white grew in a crevice on the rock. It was made of tiny threads spun together into a ball about the size of a boy\u2019s fist.\r\n\u201CI\u2019m right, aren\u2019t I?\u201D Tien asked. \u201CThat is one?\u201D\r\nKal lifted the flask and poured water down the side of the stone onto the patch of white. The threads dissolved in the simulated rainwater, the cocoon melting to reveal a small creature with slick brown and green skin. The lurg had six legs that it used to grip the stone, and its eyes were in the center of its back. It hopped off the stone, searching for insects. Tien laughed, watching it bounce from rock to rock, sticking to the stones. It left behind patches of mucus wherever it landed.\r\nKal leaned back against the stone, watching his brother, remembering days\u2014not so long ago\u2014when chasing lurgs had been more exciting.\r\n\u201CSo,\u201D Laral said, folding her arms. \u201CWhat are you going to do? If your father tries to send you to Kharbranth?\u201D\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know,\u201D Kal said. \u201CThe surgeons won\u2019t take anyone before their sixteenth Weeping, so I\u2019ve got time to think.\u201D The best surgeons and healers trained in Kharbranth. Everyone knew that. The city was said to have more hospitals than taverns.\r\n\u201CIt sounds like your father is forcing you to do what he wants, not what you want,\u201D Laral said.\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s the way everyone does it,\u201D Kal said, scratching his head. \u201CThe other boys don\u2019t mind becoming farmers because their fathers were farmers, and Ral just became the new town carpenter. He didn\u2019t mind that it was what his father did. Why should I mind being a surgeon?\u201D\r\n\u201CI just\u2014\u201D Laral looked angry. \u201CKal, if you go to war and find a Shardblade, then you\u2019d be a lighteyes\u2026. I mean\u2026Oh, this is useless.\u201D She settled back, folding her arms even more tightly.\r\nKal scratched his head. She really\r\nwasacting oddly. \u201CI wouldn\u2019t mind going to war, winning honor and all that. Mostly, I\u2019d like to travel. See what other lands are like.\u201D He\u2019d heard tales of exotic animals, like enormous crustaceans or eels that sang. Of Rall Elorim, City of Shadows, or Kurth, City of Lightning.\r\nHe\u2019d spent a lot of time studying these last few years. Kal\u2019s mother said he should be allowed to have a childhood, rather than focusing so much on his future. Lirin argued that the tests to be admitted by the Kharbranthian surgeons were very rigorous. If Kal wanted a chance with them, he\u2019d have to begin learning early.\r\nAnd yet, to become a soldier\u2026The other boys dreamed of joining the army, of fighting with King Gavilar. There was talk of going to war with Jah Keved, once and for all. What would it be like, to finally see some of the heroes from stories? To fight with Highprince Sadeas, or Dalinar the Blackthorn?\r\nEventually, the lurg realized that it had been tricked. It settled down on a rock to spin its cocoon again. Kal grabbed a small, weathered stone off the ground, then laid a hand on Tien\u2019s shoulder, stopping the boy from prodding the tired amphibian. Kal moved forward and nudged the lurg with two fingers, making it hop off the boulder and onto his stone. He handed this to Tien, who watched with wide eyes as the lurg spun its cocoon, spitting out the wet silk and using tiny hands to shape it. That cocoon would be watertight from the inside, sealed by dried mucus, but rainwater outside would dissolve the sack.\r\nKal smiled, then lifted the flask and drank. This was cool, clean water, which had already had the crem settled out. Crem\u2014the sludgy brown material that fell with rainwater\u2014could make a man sick. Everybody knew that, not just surgeons. You always let water sit for a day, then poured off the fresh water on top and used the crem to make pottery.\r\nThe lurg eventually finished its cocoon. Tien immediately reached for the flask.\r\nKal held the flask high. \u201CIt\u2019ll be tired, Tien. It won\u2019t jump around anymore.\u201D\r\n\u201COh.\u201D\r\nKal lowered the flask, patting his brother\u2019s shoulder. \u201CI put it on that stone so you could carry it around. You can get it out later.\u201D He smiled. \u201COr you could drop it in Father\u2019s bathwater through the window.\u201D\r\nTien grinned at that prospect. Kal ruffled the boy\u2019s dark hair. \u201CGo see if you can find another cocoon. If we catch two, you\u2019ll have one to play with\r\nandone to slip into the bathwater.\u201D\r\nTien carefully set the rock aside, then scampered up over the boulders. The hillside here had broken during a highstorm several months back. Shattered, as if it had been hit by the fist of some enormous creature. People said that it could have been a home that got destroyed. They burned prayers of thanks to the Almighty while at the same time whispering of dangerous things that moved in the darkness at full storm. Were the Voidbringers behind the destruction, or had it been the shades of the Lost Radiants?\r\nLaral was looking toward the mansion again. She smoothed her dress nervously\u2014lately she took far more care, not getting her clothes dirty as she once had.\r\n\u201CYou still thinking about war?\u201D Kal asked.\r\n\u201CUm. Yes. I am.\u201D\r\n\u201CMake sense,\u201D he said. An army had come through recruiting just a few weeks back and had picked up a few of the older boys, though only after Citylord Wistiow had given permission. \u201CWhat do you think broke the rocks here, during the highstorm?\u201D\r\n\u201CI couldn\u2019t say.\u201D\r\nKal looked eastward. What sent the storms? His father said no ship had ever sailed for the Origin of Storms and returned safely. Few ships ever even left the coast. Being caught on the open seas during a storm meant death, so the stories said.\r\nHe took another sip from his flask, then capped it, saving the rest in case Tien found another lurg. Distant men worked the fields, wearing overalls, laced brown shirts, and sturdy boots. It was worming season. A single worm could ruin an entire polyp\u2019s worth of grain. It would incubate inside, slowly eating as the grain grew. When you finally opened up the polyp in the fall, all you\u2019d find was a big fat slug the size of two men\u2019s hands. And so they searched in the spring, going over each polyp. Where they found a burrow, they\u2019d stick in a reed tipped with sugar, which the worm would latch on to. You pulled it out and squished it under your heel, then patched the hole with crem.\r\nIt could take weeks to properly worm a field, and farmers usually went over their hills three or four times, fertilizing as they went. Kal had heard the process described a hundred times over. You didn\u2019t live in a town like Hearthstone without listening to men gripe about worms.\r\nOddly, he noticed a group older boys gathering at the foot of one of the hills. He recognized all of them, of course. Jost and Jest, brothers. Mord, Tift, Naget, Khav, and others. They each had solid, Alethi darkeyes names. Not like Kaladin\u2019s own name. It was different.\r\n\u201CWhy aren\u2019t they worming?\u201D he asked.\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know,\u201D Laral said, shifting her attention to the boys. She got an odd look in her eyes. \u201CLet\u2019s go see.\u201D She started down the hillside before Kal had a chance to object.\r\nHe scratched his head, looking toward Tien. \u201CWe\u2019re going down to the hillside there.\u201D\r\nA youthful head popped up behind a boulder. Tien nodded energetically, then turned back to his searching. Kal slipped off the boulder and walked down the slope after Laral. She reached the boys, and they regarded her with uncomfortable expressions. She\u2019d never spent much time with them, not like she had with Kal and Tien. Her father and his were pretty good friends, for all that one was lighteyed and the other dark.\r\nLaral took a perch on a nearby rock, waiting and saying nothing. Kal walked up. Why had she wanted to come down here, if she wasn\u2019t going to talk to the other boys?\r\n\u201CHo, Jost,\u201D Kal said. Senior among the boys at fourteen, Jost was nearly a man\u2014and he looked it too. His chest was broad beyond his years, his legs thick and stocky, like those of his father. He was holding a length of wood from a sapling that had been shaved into a rough approximation of a quarterstaff. \u201CWhy aren\u2019t you worming?\u201D\r\nIt was the wrong thing to say, and Kal knew it immediately. Several of the boys\u2019 expressions darkened. It was a sore point to them that Kal never had to work the hills. His protests\u2014that he spent hours upon hours memorizing muscles, bones, and cures\u2014fell on uncaring ears. All they saw was a boy who got to spend his days in the shade while they toiled in the burning sun.\r\n\u201COld Tarn found a patch of polyps that ain\u2019t growing right,\u201D Jost finally said, shooting a glance at Laral. \u201CLet us go for the day while they talked over whether to try another planting there, or just let them grow and see what comes of it.\u201D\r\nKal nodded, feeling awkward as he stood before the nine boys. They were sweaty, the knees of their trousers stained with crem and patched from rubbing stone. But Kal was clean, wearing a fine pair of trousers his mother had purchased just a few weeks before. His father had sent him and Tien out for the day while he tended to something at the citylord\u2019s manor. Kal would pay for the break with late-night studying by Stormlight, but no use explaining that to the other boys.\r\n\u201CSo, er,\u201D Kal said, \u201Cwhat were you all talking about?\u201D\r\nRather than answering, Naget said, \u201CKal, you know things.\u201D Light haired and spindly, he was the tallest of the bunch. \u201CDon\u2019t you? About the world and the like?\u201D\r\n\u201CYeah,\u201D Kal said, scratching his head. \u201CSometimes.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou ever heard of a darkeyes becoming a lighteyes?\u201D Naget asked.\r\n\u201CSure,\u201D Kal said. \u201CIt can happen, Father says. Wealthy darkeyed merchants marry lowborn lighteyes and join their family. Then maybe have lighteyed children. That sort of thing.\u201D\r\n\u201CNo, not like that,\u201D Khav said. He had low eyebrows and always seemed to have a perpetual scowl on his face. \u201CYou know. Real darkeyes. Like us.\u201D\r\nNot like you,the tone seemed to imply. Kal\u2019s family were the only one of second nahn in the town. Everyone else was fourth or fifth, and Kal\u2019s rank made them uncomfortable around him. His father\u2019s strange profession didn\u2019t help either.\r\nIt all left Kal feeling distinctly out-of-place.\r\n\u201CYou know how it can happen,\u201D Kal said. \u201CAsk Laral. She was just talking about it. If a man wins a Shardblade on the battlefield, his eyes become light.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s right,\u201D Laral said. \u201CEverybody knows it. Even a\r\nslavecould become a lighteyes if he won a Shardblade.\u201D\r\nThe boys nodded; they all had brown, black, or other dark-colored eyes. Winning a Shardblade was one of the main reasons common men went to war. In Vorin kingdoms, everyone had a chance to rise. It was, as Kal\u2019s father would say, a fundamental tenet of their society.\r\n\u201CYeah,\u201D Naget said impatiently. \u201CBut have you ever\r\nheardof it happening? Not just in stories, I mean. Does it happen for real?\u201D\r\n\u201CSure,\u201D Kal said. \u201CIt must. Otherwise, why would so many men go to war?\u201D\r\n\u201CBecause,\u201D Jest said, \u201Cwe\u2019ve gotta prepare men to fight for the Tranquiline Halls. We\u2019ve gotta send soldiers to the Heralds. The ardents are always talking of it.\u201D\r\n\u201CIn the same breaths that they tell us it\u2019s all right to be a farmer too,\u201D Khav said. \u201CLike, farming\u2019s some lonely second place or something.\u201D\r\n\u201CHey,\u201D Tift said. \u201CMy fah\u2019s a farmer, and he\u2019s right good at it. It\u2019s a noble Calling! All your fahs are farmers.\u201D\r\n\u201CAll right, fine,\u201D Jost said. \u201CBut we ain\u2019t talking of that. We\u2019re talking of Shardbearers. You go to war, you can win a Shardblade and become a light-eyes. My fah, see, he\r\nshouldhave been given that Shardblade. But the man who was with him, he took it while my fah was knocked out. Told the officer that\r\nhe\u2019dbeen the one to kill the Shardbearer, so he got the Blade, and my fah\u2014\u201D\r\nHe was cut off by Laral\u2019s tinkling laughter. Kal frowned. That was a different kind of laughter than he normally heard from her, much more subdued and kind of annoying. \u201CJost, you\u2019re claiming your father won a\r\nShardblade?\u201D she said.\r\n\u201CNo. It was taken from him,\u201D the larger boy said.\r\n\u201CDidn\u2019t your father fight in the wastescum skirmishes up north?\u201D Laral said. \u201CTell him, Kaladin.\u201D\r\n\u201CShe\u2019s right, Jost. There weren\u2019t any Shardbearers there\u2014just Reshi raiders who thought they\u2019d take advantage of the new king. They\u2019ve never had any Shardblades. If your father saw one, he must be remembering incorrectly.\u201D\r\n\u201CRemembering incorrectly?\u201D Jost said.\r\n\u201CEr, sure,\u201D Kal said quickly. \u201CI\u2019m not saying he\u2019s lying, Jost. He just might have some trauma-induced hallucinations, or something like that.\u201D\r\nThe boys grew silent, looking at Kal. One scratched his head.\r\nJost spat to the side. He seemed to be watching Laral from the corner of his eye. She pointedly looked at Kal and smiled at him.\r\n\u201CYou always got to make a man feel like an idiot, don\u2019t you, Kal?\u201D Jost said.\r\n\u201CWhat? No, I\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CYou want to make my fah sound like a fool,\u201D Jost said, face red. \u201CAnd you want to make me sound stupid. Well, some of us ain\u2019t lucky enough to spend our days eating fruit and laying about. We\u2019ve got to work.\u201D\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t\u2014\u201D\r\nJost tossed the quarterstaff to Kal. He caught it awkwardly. Then Jost took the other staff from his brother. \u201CYou insult my fah, you get a fight. That\u2019s honor. You have honor, lordling?\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m no lordling,\u201D Kal spat. \u201CStormfather, Jost, I\u2019m only a few nahn higher than you are.\u201D\r\nJost\u2019s eyes grew angrier at the mention of nahn. He held up his quarterstaff. \u201CYou going to fight me or not?\u201D Angerspren began to appear in small pools at his feet, bright red.\r\nKal knew what Jost was doing. It wasn\u2019t uncommon for the boys to look for a way to make themselves look better than him. Kal\u2019s father said it had to do with their insecurity. He\u2019d have told Kal to just drop the quarterstaff and walk away.\r\nBut Laral was sitting right there, smiling at him. And men didn\u2019t become heroes by walking away. \u201CAll right. Sure.\u201D Kal held up his quarterstaff.\r\nJost swung immediately, more quickly than Kal had anticipated. The other boys watched with a mixture of glee, shock, and amazement. Kal barely managed to get his staff up. The lengths of wood cracked together, sending a jolt up Kal\u2019s arms.\r\nKal was knocked off balance. Jost moved quickly, stepping to the side and swinging his staff down and hitting Kal in the foot. Kal cried out as a flash of agony lanced up his leg, and he released the staff with one hand and reached down.\r\nJost swung his staff around and hit Kal\u2019s side. Kal gasped, letting the staff clatter to the stones and grabbing his side as he fell to his knees. He breathed out in huffing breaths, straining against the pain. Small, spindly painspren\u2014glowing pale orange hand shapes, like stretching sinew or muscles\u2014crawled from the stone around him.\r\nKal dropped one hand to the stones, leaning forward as he held his side.\r\nYou\u2019d better not have broken any of my ribs, you cremling,he thought.\r\nTo the side, Laral pursed her lips. Kal felt a sudden, overpowering shame.\r\nJost lowered his staff, looking abashed. \u201CWell,\u201D he said. \u201CYou can see that my fah trained me right good. Maybe that will show you. The things he says are true, and\u2014\u201D\r\nKal growled in anger and pain, snatching his quarterstaff from the ground and leaping at Jost. The older boy cursed, stumbling backward as he raised his weapon. Kal bellowed, slamming his weapon forward.\r\nSomething changed in that moment. Kal felt an energy as he held the weapon, an excitement that washed away his pain. He spun, smashing the staff into one of Jost\u2019s hands.\r\nJost let go with that hand, screaming. Kal brought his weapon around and slammed it into the boy\u2019s side. Kal had never held a weapon before, never been in a fight any more dangerous than a wrestling match with Tien. But the length of wood felt\r\nrightin his fingers. He was amazed by how wonderful the moment felt.\r\nJost grunted, stumbling again, and Kal brought his weapon back around, preparing to smash Jost\u2019s face. He raised his staff, but then froze. Jost was bleeding from the hand Kal had hit. Just a little, but it was blood.\r\nHe\u2019d hurt someone.\r\nJost growled and lurched upright. Before Kal could protest, the larger boy swept Kal\u2019s legs from underneath him, sending him to the ground, knocking the breath from his lungs. That set afire the wound in his side, and the painspren scampered across the ground, latching on to Kal\u2019s side, looking like an orange scar as they fed on Kal\u2019s agony.\r\nJost stepped back. Kal lay on his back, breathing. He didn\u2019t know what to feel. Holding the staff in that moment had felt wonderful. Incredible. At the same time, he could see Laral to the side. She stood up and, instead of kneeling to help him, turned and walked away, toward her father\u2019s mansion.\r\nTears welled in Kal\u2019s eyes. With a shout, he rolled over and grabbed the quarterstaff again. He would\r\nnotgive in!\r\n\u201CNone of that now,\u201D Jost said from behind. Kal felt something hard on his back, a boot shoving him down to the stone. Jest took the staff from Kal\u2019s fingers.\r\nI failed. I\u2026lost.He hated the feeling, hated it far more than the pain.\r\n\u201CYou did well,\u201D Jost said grudgingly. \u201CBut leave off. I don\u2019t want to have to hurt you for real.\u201D\r\nKal bowed his head down, letting his forehead rest on the warm, sunlit rock. Jost removed his foot, and the boys withdrew, chatting, their boots scraping on rock. Kal forced himself to his hands and knees, then up onto his feet.\r\nJost turned back, wary, holding his quarterstaff in one hand.\r\n\u201CTeach me,\u201D Kal said.\r\nJost blinked in surprise. He glanced at his brother.\r\n\u201CTeach me,\u201D Kal pled, stepping forward. \u201CI\u2019ll worm for you, Jost. My father gives me two hours off each afternoon. I\u2019ll do your work then if you\u2019ll teach me, in the evenings, what your father is teaching you with that staff.\u201D\r\nHe\r\nhadto know. Had to feel the weapon in his hands again. Had to see if that moment he\u2019d felt had been a fluke. Jost considered, then finally shook his head. \u201CCan\u2019t. Your fah would kill me. Get those surgeon\u2019s hands of yours all covered with calluses? Wouldn\u2019t be right.\u201D He turned away. \u201CYou go be what you are, Kal. I\u2019ll be what I am.\u201D\r\nKal stood for a long while, watching them go. He sat down on the rock. Laral\u2019s figure was growing distant. There were some servants coming down the hillside to fetch her. Should he chase after her? His side still hurt, and he was annoyed at her for leading him down to the others in the first place. And, above all, he was\r\nstillembarrassed.\r\nHe lay back down, emotions welling inside of him. He had trouble sorting through them.\r\n\u201CKaladin?\u201D\r\nHe turned, ashamed to find tears in his eyes, and saw Tien sitting on the ground behind him. \u201CHow long have you been there?\u201D Kal snapped.\r\nTien smiled, then set a rock on the ground. He climbed to his feet and hurried away, not stopping when Kal called after him. Grumbling, Kal forced himself to his feet and walked over to pick up the rock.\r\nIt was another dull, ordinary stone. Tien had a habit of finding those and thinking they were incredibly precious. He had an entire collection of them back in the house. He knew where he\u2019d found each one, and could tell you what was special about it.\r\nWith a sigh, Kal began walking back toward the town.\r\nYou go be what you are. I\u2019ll be what I am.\r\nHis side smarted. Why hadn\u2019t he hit Jost when he\u2019d had the chance? Could he train himself out of freezing in battle like that? He could learn to hurt. Couldn\u2019t he?\r\nDid he want to?\r\nYou go be what you are.\r\nWhat did a man do if he didn\u2019t\r\nknowwhat he was? Or even what he wanted to be?\r\nEventually, he reached Hearthstone proper. The hundred or so buildings were set in rows, each one shaped like a wedge with the low side pointing stormward. The roofs were of thick wood, tarred to seal out the rain. The northern and southern sides of the buildings rarely had windows, but the fronts\u2014facing west away from the storms\u2014were nearly all window. Like the plants of the stormlands, the lives of men here were dominated by the highstorms.\r\nKal\u2019s home was near the outskirts. It was larger than most, built wide to accommodate the surgery room, which had its own entrance. The door was ajar, so Kal peeked in. He\u2019d expected to see his mother cleaning, but instead found that his father had returned from Brightlord Wistiow\u2019s manor. Lirin sat on the edge of the operating table, hands in his lap, bald head bowed. He held his spectacles in his hand, and he looked exhausted.\r\n\u201CFather?\u201D Kal asked. \u201CWhy are you sitting in the dark?\u201D\r\nLirin looked up. His face was somber, distant.\r\n\u201CFather?\u201D Kal asked, growing more concerned.\r\n\u201CBrightlord Wistiow has been carried by the winds.\u201D\r\n\u201CHe\u2019s\r\ndead?\u201D Kal was so shocked he forgot his side. Wistiow had\r\nalwaysbeen there. He couldn\u2019t be gone. What of Laral? \u201CHe was healthy just last week!\u201D\r\n\u201CHe has always been frail, Kal,\u201D Lirin said. \u201CThe Almighty calls all men back to the Spiritual Realm eventually.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou didn\u2019t do anything?\u201D Kal blurted out; he regretted the words immediately.\r\n\u201CI did all I could,\u201D his father said, rising. \u201CPerhaps a man with more training than I\u2026Well, there is no use in regrets.\u201D He walked to the side of the room, removing the black covering from the goblet lamp filled with diamond spheres. It lit the room immediately, blazing like a tiny sun.\r\n\u201CWe have no citylord then,\u201D Kal said, raising a hand to his head. \u201CHe had no son\u2026.\u201D\r\n\u201CThose in Kholinar will appoint us a new citylord,\u201D Lirin said. \u201CAlmighty send them wisdom in the choice.\u201D He looked at the goblet lamp. Those were the citylord\u2019s spheres. A small fortune.\r\nKal\u2019s father put the covering right back on the goblet, as if he hadn\u2019t just removed it. The motion plunged the room back into darkness, and Kal blinked as his eyes adjusted.\r\n\u201CHe left these to us,\u201D Kal\u2019s father said.\r\nKal started. \u201C\r\nWhat?\u201D\r\n\u201CYou\u2019re to be sent to Kharbranth when you turn sixteen. These spheres will pay your way\u2014Brightlord Wistiow requested it be done, a last act to care for his people. You will go and become a true master surgeon, then return to Hearthstone.\u201D\r\nIn that moment, Kal knew his fate had been sealed. If Brightlord Wistiow had demanded it, Kal would go to Kharbranth. He turned and walked from the surgery room, passing out into the sunlight, not saying another word to his father.\r\nHe sat down on the steps. What\r\ndidhe want? He didn\u2019t know. That was the problem. Glory, honor, the things Laral had said\u2026none of those really mattered to him. But there had been\r\nsomethingthere when he\u2019d held the quarterstaff. And now, suddenly, the decision had been taken from him.\r\nThe rocks Tien had given him were still in his pocket. He pulled them out, then took his canteen off his belt and washed them with water. The first one he\u2019d been given showed the white swirls and strata. It appeared the other one had a hidden design too.\r\nIt looked like a face, smiling at him, made of white bits in the rock. Kal smiled despite himself, though it quickly faded. A rock wasn\u2019t going to solve his problems.\r\nUnfortunately, though he sat for a long while thinking, it didn\u2019t look like anything would solve his problems. He wasn\u2019t sure he wanted to be a surgeon, and he felt suddenly constricted by what life was forcing him to become.\r\nBut that one moment holding the quarterstaff sang to him. A single moment of clarity in an otherwise confusing world."

      "ChapterName": "17: A BLOODY, RED SUNSET",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\nMight I be quite frank? Before, you asked why I was so concerned. It is for the following reason:\r\n\u201CHe\u2019s\r\nold,\u201D Syl said with awe, flitting around the apothecary. \u201CReally old. I didn\u2019t know men got this old. You sure he\u2019s not decayspren wearing a man\u2019s skin?\u201D\r\nKaladin smiled as the apothecary shuffled forward with his cane, oblivious of the invisible windspren. His face was as full of chasms as the Shattered Plains themselves, weaving out in a pattern from his deeply recessed eyes. He wore a pair of thick spectacles on the tip of his nose, and was dressed in dark robes.\r\nKaladin\u2019s father had told him of apothecaries\u2014men who walked the line between herbalists and surgeons. Common people regarded the healing arts with enough superstition that it was easy for an apothecary to cultivate an arcane air. The wooden walls were draped with cloth glyphwards styled in cryptic patterns, and behind the counter were shelves with rows of jars. A full human skeleton hung in the far corner, held together by wires. The windowless room was lit with bundles of garnet spheres hanging from the corners.\r\nDespite all that, the place was clean and tidy. It had the familiar scent of antiseptic Kaladin associated with his father\u2019s surgery.\r\n\u201CAh, young bridgeman.\u201D The short apothecary adjusted his spectacles. He stooped forward, running his fingers through his wispy white beard. \u201CCome for a ward against danger, perhaps? Or maybe a young washwoman in the camp has caught your eye? I have a potion which, if slipped into her drink, will make her regard you with favor.\u201D\r\nKaladin raised an eyebrow.\r\nSyl, however, opened her mouth in an amazed expression. \u201CYou should give that to Gaz, Kaladin. It would be nice if he liked you more.\u201D\r\nI doubt that\u2019s what it\u2019s intended for,Kaladin thought with a smile.\r\n\u201CYoung bridgeman?\u201D the apothecary asked. \u201CIs it a charm against evil you desire?\u201D\r\nKaladin\u2019s father had spoken of these things. Many apothecaries purveyed supposed love charms or potions to cure all manner of ailments. They\u2019d contain nothing more than some sugar and a few pinches of common herbs to give a spike of alertness or drowsiness, depending on the purported effect. It was all nonsense, though Kaladin\u2019s mother\r\nhadput great stock in glyphwards. Kaladin\u2019s father had always expressed disappointment in her stubborn way of clinging to \u201Csuperstitions.\u201D\r\n\u201CI need some bandages,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CAnd a flask of lister\u2019s oil or knobweed sap. Also, a needle and gut, if you have any.\u201D\r\nThe apothecary\u2019s eyes opened wide in surprise.\r\n\u201CI\u2019m the son of a surgeon,\u201D Kaladin admitted. \u201CTrained by his hand. He was trained by a man who had studied in the Great Concourse of Kharbranth.\u201D\r\n\u201CAh,\u201D the apothecary said. \u201CWell.\u201D He stood up straighter, setting aside his cane and brushing his robes. \u201CBandages, you said? And some antiseptic? Let me see\u2026.\u201D He moved back behind the counter.\r\nKaladin blinked. The man\u2019s age hadn\u2019t changed, but he didn\u2019t seem nearly as frail. His step was firmer, and his voice had lost its whispering raspiness. He searched through his bottles, mumbling to himself as he read off his labels. \u201CYou could just go to the surgeon\u2019s hall. They would charge you far less.\u201D\r\n\u201CNot for a bridgeman,\u201D Kaladin said, grimacing. He\u2019d been turned away. The supplies there were for real soldiers.\r\n\u201CI see,\u201D the apothecary said, setting a jar on the counter, then bending down to poke in some drawers.\r\nSyl flitted over to Kaladin. \u201CEvery time he bends I think he\u2019ll snap like a twig.\u201D She\r\nwasgrowing able to understand abstract thought, and at a surprisingly rapid pace.\r\nI know what death is\u2026.He still wasn\u2019t certain whether to feel sorry for her or not.\r\nKaladin picked up the small bottle and undid the cork, smelling what was inside. \u201CLarmic mucus?\u201D He grimaced at the foul smell. \u201CThat\u2019s not nearly as effective as the two I asked for.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut it\u2019s far cheaper,\u201D the old man said, coming up with a large box. He opened the lid, revealing sterile white bandages. \u201CAnd you, as has been noted, are a bridgeman.\u201D\r\n\u201CHow much for the mucus, then?\u201D He\u2019d been worried about this; his father had never mentioned how much his supplies cost.\r\n\u201CTwo bloodmarks for the bottle.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s what you consider\r\ncheap?\u201D\r\n\u201CLister\u2019s oil costs two sapphire marks.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd knobweed sap?\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CI saw some of reeds of it growing just outside of camp! It can\u2019t be\r\nthatrare.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd do you know how much sap comes from a single plant?\u201D the apothecary asked, pointing.\r\nKaladin hesitated. It wasn\u2019t true sap, but a milky substance that you could squeeze from the stalks. Or so his father had said. \u201CNo,\u201D Kaladin admitted.\r\n\u201CA single drop,\u201D the man said. \u201CIf you\u2019re lucky. It\u2019s cheaper than lister\u2019s oil, sure, but more expensive than the mucus. Even if the mucus\r\ndoesstink like the Nightwatcher\u2019s own backside.\u201D\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t have that much,\u201D Kaladin said. It was five diamond marks to a garnet. Ten days\u2019 pay to buy one small jar of antiseptic. Stormfather!\r\nThe apothecary sniffed. \u201CThe needle and gut will cost two clearmarks. Can you afford that, at least?\u201D\r\n\u201CBarely. How much for the bandages? Two full emeralds?\u201D\r\n\u201CThey\u2019re just old scraps that I bleached and boiled. Two clearchips an arm length.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll give a mark for the box.\u201D\r\n\u201CVery well.\u201D Kaladin reached into his pocket to get the spheres as the old apothecary continued, \u201CYou surgeons, all the same. Never give a blink to consider where your supplies come from. You just use them like there will be no end.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou can\u2019t put a price on a person\u2019s life,\u201D Kaladin said. One of his father\u2019s sayings. It was the main reason that Lirin had never charged for his services.\r\nKaladin brought out his four marks. He hesitated when he saw them, however. Only one was still glowing with its soft crystal light. The other three were dull, the bits of diamond barely visible at the center of the drops of glass.\r\n\u201CHere now,\u201D the apothecary said, squinting. \u201CYou trying to pass dun spheres off on me?\u201D He snatched one before Kaladin could complain, then fished around under his counter. He brought up a jeweler\u2019s loupe, removing his spectacles and holding the sphere up toward the light. \u201CAh. No, that\u2019s a real gemstone. You should get your spheres infused, bridgeman. Not everyone is as trusting as I am.\u201D\r\n\u201CThey were glowing this morning,\u201D Kaladin protested. \u201CGaz must have paid me with run-down spheres.\u201D\r\nThe apothecary removed his loupe and replaced the spectacles. He selected three marks, including the glowing one.\r\n\u201CCould I have that one?\u201D Kaladin asked.\r\nThe apothecary frowned.\r\n\u201CAlways keep a glowing sphere in your pocket,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CIt\u2019s good luck.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou certain you don\u2019t want a love potion?\u201D\r\n\u201CIf you get caught in the dark, you\u2019ll have light,\u201D Kaladin said tersely. \u201CBesides, as you said, most people aren\u2019t as trusting as you.\u201D\r\nReluctantly, the apothecary traded the infused sphere for the dead one\u2014though he did check it with the loupe to be certain. A dun sphere was worth just as much as an infused one; all you had to do was leave it out in a highstorm, and it would recharge and give off light for a week or so.\r\nKaladin pocketed the infused sphere and picked up his purchase. He nodded farewell to the apothecary, and Syl joined him as he stepped out into the camp\u2019s street.\r\nHe\u2019d spent some of the afternoon listening to soldiers at the mess hall, and he\u2019d learned some things about the warcamps. Things he should have learned weeks ago, but had been too despondent to care about. He now knew about the chrysalises on the plateaus, the gemhearts they contained, and the competition between the highprinces. He understood why Sadeas pushed his men so hard, and he was beginning to see why Sadeas turned around if they got to the plateau later than another army. That wasn\u2019t very common. More often, Sadeas arrived first, and the other Alethi armies that came up behind them had to turn back.\r\nThe warcamps were enormous. All told, there were over a hundred thousand troops in the various Alethi camps, many times the population of Hearthstone. And that wasn\u2019t counting the civilians. A mobile warcamp attracted a large array of camp followers; stationary warcamps like these on the Shattered Plains brought even more.\r\nEach of the ten warcamps filled its own crater, and was filled with an incongruous mix of Soulcast buildings, shanties, and tents. Some merchants, like the apothecary, had the money to build a wooden structure. Those who lived in tents took them down for storms, then paid for shelter elsewhere. Even within the crater, the stormwinds were strong, particularly where the outer wall was low or broken. Some places\u2014like the lumberyard\u2014were completely exposed.\r\nThe street bustled with the usual crowd. Women in skirts and blouses\u2014the wives, sisters, or daughters of the soldiers, merchants, or craftsmen. Workers in trousers or overalls. A large number of soldiers in leathers, carrying spear and shield. All were Sadeas\u2019s men. Soldiers of one camp didn\u2019t mix with those of another, and you stayed away from another brightlord\u2019s crater unless you had business there.\r\nKaladin shook his head in dismay.\r\n\u201CWhat?\u201D Syl asked, settling on his shoulder.\r\n\u201CI hadn\u2019t expected there to be so much discord among the camps here. I thought it would all be one king\u2019s army, unified.\u201D\r\n\u201CPeople are discord,\u201D Syl said.\r\n\u201CWhat does that mean?\u201D\r\n\u201CYou all act differently and think differently. Nothing else is like that\u2014animals act alike, and all spren are, in a sense, virtually the same individual. There\u2019s harmony in that. But not in you\u2014it seems that no two of you can agree on anything. All the world does as it is supposed to, except for humans. Maybe that\u2019s why you so often want to kill each other.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut not\r\nallwindspren act alike,\u201D Kaladin said, opening the box and tucking some of the bandages into the pocket he\u2019d sewn into the inside of his leather vest. \u201CYou\u2019re proof of that.\u201D\r\n\u201CI know,\u201D she said softly. \u201CMaybe now you can see why it bothers me so.\u201D\r\nKaladin didn\u2019t know how to respond to that. Eventually, he reached the lumberyard. A few members of Bridge Four lounged in the shade on the east side of their barrack. It would be interesting to see one of those barracks get made\u2014they were Soulcast directly from air into stone. Unfortunately, Soulcastings happened at night, and under strict guard to keep the holy rite from being witnessed by anyone other than ardents or very high-ranking lighteyes.\r\nThe first afternoon bell sounded right as Kaladin reached the barrack, and he caught a glare from Gaz for nearly being late for bridge duty. Most of that \u201Cduty\u201D would be spent sitting around, waiting for the horns to blow. Well, Kaladin didn\u2019t intend to waste time. He couldn\u2019t risk tiring himself by carrying the plank, not when a bridge run could be imminent, but perhaps he could do some stretches or\u2014\r\nA horn sounded in the air, crisp and clean. It was like the mythical horn that was said to guide the souls of the brave to heaven\u2019s battlefield. Kaladin froze. As always, he waited for the second blast, an irrational part of him needing to hear confirmation. It came, sounding a pattern indicating the location of the pupating chasmfiend.\r\nSoldiers began to scramble toward the staging area beside the lumberyard; others ran into camp to fetch their gear. \u201CLine up!\u201D Kaladin shouted, dashing up to the bridgemen. \u201CStorm you! Every man in a line!\u201D\r\nThey ignored him. Some of the men weren\u2019t wearing their vests, and they clogged the barrack doorway, all trying to get in. Those who had their vests ran for the bridge. Kaladin followed, frustrated. Once there, the men gathered around the bridge in a carefully prearranged manner. Each man got a chance to be in the best position: running in front up to the chasm, then moving to the relative safety of the back for the final approach.\r\nThere was a strict rotation, and errors were neither made nor tolerated. Bridge crews had a brutal system of self-management: If a man tried to cheat, the others forced him to run the final approach in front. That sort of thing was supposed to be forbidden, but Gaz turned a blind eye toward cheaters. He also refused bribes to let men change positions. Perhaps he knew that the only stability\u2014the only hope\u2014the bridgemen had was in their rotation. Life wasn\u2019t fair, being a bridgeman wasn\u2019t fair, but at least if you ran the deathline and survived, the next time you got to run at the back.\r\nThere was one exception. As bridgeleader, Kaladin got to run in the front most of the way, then move to the back for the assault. His was the safest position in the group, though no bridgeman was truly safe. Kaladin was like a moldy crust on a starving man\u2019s plate; not the first bite, but still doomed.\r\nHe got into position. Yake, Dunny, and Malop were the last stragglers. Once they\u2019d taken their places, Kaladin commanded the men to lift. He was half surprised to be obeyed, but there was almost always a bridgeleader to give commands during a run. The voice changed, but the simple orders did not. Lift, run, lower.\r\nTwenty bridges charged down from the lumberyard and toward the Shattered Plains. Kaladin noticed a group of bridgemen from Bridge Seven watching with relief. They\u2019d been on duty until the first afternoon bell; they\u2019d avoided this run by mere moments.\r\nThe bridgemen worked hard. It wasn\u2019t just because of threats of beatings\u2014they ran so hard because they wanted to arrive at the target plateau before the Parshendi did. If they did so, there would be no arrows, no death. And so running their bridges was the one thing the bridgemen did without reservation or laziness. Though many hated their lives, they still clung to them with white-knuckled fervor.\r\nThey clomped across the first of the permanent bridges. Kaladin\u2019s muscles groaned in protest at being worked again so soon, but he tried not to dwell on his fatigue. The highstorm\u2019s rains from the night before meant that most plants were still open, rockbuds spewing out vines, flowering branzahs reaching clawlike branches out of crevices toward the sky. There were also occasional prickletacs: the needly, stone-limbed little shrubs Kaladin had noticed his first time through the area. Water pooled in the numerous crevices and depressions on the surface of the uneven plateau.\r\nGaz called out directions, telling them which pathway to take. Many of the nearby plateaus had three or four bridges, creating branching paths across the Plains. The running became rote. It was exhausting, but it was also familiar, and it was nice to be at the front, where he could see where he was going. Kaladin fell into his usual step-counting mantra, as he\u2019d been advised to do by that nameless bridgeman whose sandals he still wore.\r\nEventually, they reached the last of the permanent bridges. They crossed a short plateau, passing the smoldering ruins of a bridge the Parshendi had destroyed during the night. How had the Parshendi managed that, during a highstorm? Earlier, while listening to the soldiers, he\u2019d learned that the soldiers regarded the Parshendi with hatred, anger, and not a little awe. These Parshendi weren\u2019t like the lazy, nearly mute parshmen who worked throughout Roshar. These Parshendi were warriors of no small skill. That still struck Kaladin as incongruous. Parshmen? Fighting? It was just so strange.\r\nBridge Four and the other crews got their bridges down, spanning a chasm where it was narrowest. His men collapsed to the ground around their bridge, relaxing while the army crossed. Kaladin nearly joined them\u2014in fact, his knees nearly buckled in anticipation.\r\nNo,he thought, steadying himself.\r\nNo. I stand.\r\nIt was a foolish gesture. The other bridgemen barely paid him any heed. One man, Moash, even swore at him. But now that Kaladin had made the decision, he stubbornly stuck to it, clasping his hands behind his back and falling into parade rest while watching the army cross.\r\n\u201CHo, little bridgeman!\u201D a soldier called from among those waiting their turn. \u201CCurious at what\r\nrealsoldiers look like?\u201D\r\nKaladin turned toward the man, a solid, brown-eyed fellow with arms the size of many men\u2019s thighs. He was a squadleader, by the knots on the shoulder of his leather jerkin. Kaladin had borne those knots once.\r\n\u201CHow do you treat your spear and shield, squadleader?\u201D Kaladin called back.\r\nThe man frowned, but Kaladin knew what he was thinking. A soldier\u2019s gear was his life; you cared for your weapon as you\u2019d care for your children, often seeing to its upkeep before you took food or rest.\r\nKaladin nodded to the bridge. \u201CThis is\r\nmybridge,\u201D he said in a loud voice. \u201CIt is my weapon, the only one allowed me. Treat her well.\u201D\r\n\u201COr you\u2019ll do what?\u201D called one of the other soldiers, prompting laughter among the ranks. The squadleader said nothing. He looked troubled.\r\nKaladin\u2019s words were bravado. In truth, he hated the bridge. Still, he remained standing.\r\nA few moments later, Highprince Sadeas himself crossed on Kaladin\u2019s bridge. Brightlord Amaram had always seemed so heroic, so distinguished. A gentleman general. This Sadeas was a different creature entirely, with that round face, curly hair, and lofty expression. He rode as if he were in a parade, one hand lightly holding the reins before him, the other carrying his helm under his arm. His armor was painted red, and the helm bore frivolous tassels. There was so much pointless pomp that it nearly overshadowed the wonder of the ancient artifact.\r\nKaladin forgot his fatigue and formed his hands into fists. Here was a lighteyes he could hate even more than most, a man so callous that he threw away the lives of hundreds of bridgemen each month. A man who had expressly forbidden his bridgemen to have shields for reasons Kaladin still didn\u2019t understand.\r\nSadeas and his honor guard soon passed, and Kaladin realized that he probably should have bowed. Sadeas hadn\u2019t noticed, but it could have made trouble if he had. Shaking his head, Kaladin roused his bridge crew, though it took special prodding to get Rock\u2014the large Horneater\u2014up and moving. Once across the chasm, his men picked up their bridge and jogged toward the next chasm.\r\nThe process was repeated enough times that Kaladin lost count. At each crossing, he refused to lie down. He stood with hands behind his back, watching the army pass. More soldiers took note of him, jeering. Kaladin ignored them, and by the fifth or sixth crossing, the jeers faded. The one other time he saw Brightlord Sadeas, Kaladin gave a bow, though it made his stomach twist to do so. He did not serve this man. He did not give this man allegiance. But he\r\ndidserve his men of Bridge Four. He would save them, and that meant he had to keep himself from being punished for insolence.\r\n\u201CReverse runners!\u201D Gaz called. \u201CCross and reverse!\u201D\r\nKaladin turned sharply. The next crossing would be the assault. He squinted, looking into the distance, and could just barely make out a line of dark figures gathering on another plateau. The Parshendi had arrived and were forming up. Behind them, a group worked on breaking open the chrysalis.\r\nKaladin felt a spike of frustration. Their speed hadn\u2019t been enough. And\u2014tired though they were\u2014Sadeas would want to attack quickly, before the Parshendi could get the gemheart out of its shell.\r\nThe bridgemen rose from their rest, silent, haunted. They knew what was coming. They crossed the chasm and pulled the bridge over, then rearranged themselves in reverse order. The soldiers formed ranks. It was all so silent, like men preparing to carry a casket to the pyre.\r\nThe bridgemen left a space for Kaladin at the back, sheltered and protected. Syl alighted on the bridge, looking at the spot. Kaladin walked up to it, so tired, mentally and physically. He\u2019d pushed himself too hard in the morning, then again by standing instead of resting. What had possessed him to do such a thing? He could barely walk.\r\nHe looked over the bridgemen. His men were resigned, despondent, terrified. If they refused to run, they\u2019d be executed. If they did run, they\u2019d face the arrows. They didn\u2019t look toward the distant line of Parshendi archers. Instead, they looked down.\r\nThey are your men,Kaladin told himself.\r\nThey need you to lead them, even if they don\u2019t know it.\r\nHow can you lead from the rear?\r\nHe stepped out of line and rounded the bridge; two of the men\u2014Drehy and Teft\u2014looked up in shock as he passed. The deathpoint\u2014the spot in the very center of the front\u2014was being held by Rock, the beefy, tan-skinned Horneater. Kaladin tapped him on the shoulder. \u201CYou\u2019re in my spot, Rock.\u201D\r\nThe man glanced at him, surprised. \u201CBut\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CTo the back with you.\u201D\r\nRock frowned. Nobody ever tried to jump\r\naheadin the order. \u201CYou\u2019re airsick, lowlander,\u201D he said with his thick accent. \u201CYou wish to die? Why do you not just go leap into the chasm? That would be easier.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m bridgeleader. It\u2019s my privilege to run at the front. Go.\u201D\r\nRock shrugged, but did as ordered, taking Kaladin\u2019s position at the back. Nobody said a word. If Kaladin wanted to get himself killed, who were they to complain?\r\nKaladin looked over the bridgemen. \u201CThe longer we take to get this bridge down, the more arrows they can loose at us. Stay firm, stay determined, and\r\nbe quick. Raise bridge!\u201D\r\nThe men lifted, inner rows moving underneath and situating themselves in rows of five across. Kaladin stood at the very front with a tall, stout man named Leyten to his left, a spindly man named Murk to his right. Adis and Corl were at the edges. Five men in front. The deathline.\r\nOnce all of the crews had their bridges up, Gaz gave the command. \u201CAssault!\u201D\r\nThey ran, dashing alongside the standing ranks of the army, passing soldiers holding spears and shields. Some watched with curiosity, perhaps amused at the sight of the lowly bridgemen running so urgently to their deaths. Others looked away, perhaps ashamed of the lives it would cost to get them across that chasm.\r\nKaladin kept his eyes forward, squelching that incredulous voice in the back of his mind, one that screamed he was doing something very stupid. He barreled toward the final chasm, focused on the Parshendi line. Figures with black and crimson skin holding bows.\r\nSyl flitted close to Kaladin\u2019s head, no longer in the form of a person, streaking like a ribbon of light. She zipped in front of him.\r\nThe bows came up. Kaladin hadn\u2019t been at the deathpoint during a charge this bad since his first day on the crew. They always put new men into rotation at the deathpoint. That way, if they died, you didn\u2019t have to worry about training them.\r\nThe Parshendi archers drew, aiming at five or six of the bridge crews. Bridge Four was obviously in their sights.\r\nThe bows loosed.\r\n\u201CTien!\u201D Kaladin screamed, nearly mad with fatigue and frustration. He bellowed the name aloud\u2014uncertain why\u2014as a wall of arrows zipped toward him. Kaladin felt a jolt of energy, a surge of sudden strength, unanticipated and unexplained.\r\nThe arrows landed.\r\nMurk fell without a sound, four or five arrows striking him, spraying his blood across the stones. Leyten dropped as well, and with him both Adis and Corl. Shafts struck the ground at Kaladin\u2019s feet, shattering, and a good half dozen hit the wood around Kaladin\u2019s head and hands.\r\nKaladin didn\u2019t know if he\u2019d been hit. He was too flush with energy and alarm. He continued running, screaming, holding the bridge on his shoulders. For some reason, a group of Parshendi archers ahead lowered their bows. He saw their marbled skin, strange reddish or orange helms, and simple brown clothing. They appeared confused.\r\nWhatever the reason, it gained Bridge Four a few precious moments. By the time the Parshendi raised their bows again, Kaladin\u2019s team had reached the chasm. His men fell into line with the other bridge crews\u2014there were only fifteen bridges now. Five had fallen. They closed the gaps as they arrived.\r\nKaladin screamed for the bridgemen to drop amid another spray of arrows. One sliced open the skin near his ribs, deflecting off the bone. He felt it hit, but didn\u2019t feel any pain. He scrambled around the side of the bridge, helping push. Kaladin\u2019s team slammed the bridge into place as a wave of Alethi arrows distracted the enemy archers.\r\nA troop of cavalry charged across the bridges. The bridgemen were soon forgotten. Kaladin fell to his knees beside the bridge as the others of his crew stumbled away, bloodied and hurt, their part in the battle over.\r\nKaladin held his side, feeling the blood there.\r\nStraight laceration, only about an inch long, not wide enough to be of danger.\r\nIt was his father\u2019s voice.\r\nKaladin panted. He needed to get to safety. Arrows zipped over his head, fired by the Alethi archers.\r\nSome people take lives. Other people save lives.\r\nHe wasn\u2019t done yet. Kaladin forced himself to his feet and staggered to where someone lay beside the bridge. It was a bridgeman named Hobber; he had an arrow through the leg. The man moaned, holding his thigh.\r\nKaladin grabbed him under the arms and pulled him away from the bridge. The man cursed at the pain, dazed, as Kaladin towed him to a cleft behind a small bulge in the rock where Rock and some of the other bridgemen had sought shelter.\r\nAfter dropping off Hobber\u2014the arrow hadn\u2019t hit any major arteries, and he would be fine for a time yet\u2014Kaladin turned and tried to rush back out onto the battlefield proper. He slipped, however, stumbling in his fatigue. He hit the ground hard, grunting.\r\nSome take lives. Some save lives.\r\nHe pushed himself to his feet, sweat dripping from his brow, and scrambled back toward the bridge, his father\u2019s voice in his ears. The next bridgeman he found, a man named Koorm, was dead. Kaladin left the body.\r\nGadol had a deep wound in the side where an arrow had passed completely through him. His face was covered with blood from a gash on his temple, and he\u2019d managed to crawl a short distance from the bridge. He looked up with frenzied black eyes, orange painspren waving around him. Kaladin grabbed him under the arms and towed him away just before a thundering charge of cavalry trampled the place where he\u2019d been lying.\r\nKaladin dragged Gadol over to the cleft, noting two more dead. He did a quick count. That made twenty-nine bridgemen, including the dead he\u2019d seen. Five were missing. Kaladin stumbled back out onto the battlefield.\r\nSoldiers had bunched up around the back of the bridge, archers forming at the sides and firing into the Parshendi lines as the heavy cavalry charge\u2014led by Highprince Sadeas himself, virtually indestructible in his Shardplate\u2014tried to push the enemy back.\r\nKaladin wavered, dizzy, dismayed at the sight of so many men running, shouting, firing arrows and throwing spears. Five bridgemen, probably dead, lost in all of that\u2014\r\nHe spotted a figure huddled just beside the chasm lip with arrows flying back and forth over his head. It was Dabbid, one of the bridgemen. He curled up, arm twisted at an awkward angle.\r\nKaladin charged in. He threw himself to the ground and crawled beneath the zipping arrows, hoping that the Parshendi would ignore a couple of unarmed bridgemen. Dabbid didn\u2019t even notice when Kaladin reached him. He was in shock, lips moving soundlessly, eyes dazed. Kaladin grabbed him awkwardly, afraid to stand up too high lest an arrow hit him.\r\nHe dragged Dabbid away from the edge in a clumsy half crawl. He kept slipping on blood, falling, abrading his arms on the rock, hitting his face against the stone. He persisted, towing the younger man out from underneath the flying arrows. Finally, he got far enough away that he risked standing. He tried to pick up Dabbid. But his muscles were so weak. He strained and slipped, exhausted, falling to the stones.\r\nHe lay there, gasping, the pain of his side finally washing over him.\r\nSo tired\u2026.\r\nHe stood up shakily, then tried again to grab Dabbid. He blinked away tears of frustration, too weak to even pull the man.\r\n\u201CAirsick lowlander,\u201D a voice growled.\r\nKaladin turned as Rock arrived. The massive Horneater grabbed Dabbid under the arms, pulling him. \u201CCrazy,\u201D he grumbled to Kaladin, but easily lifted the wounded bridgeman and carried him back to the hollow.\r\nKaladin followed. He collapsed in the hollow, his back to the rock. The surviving bridgemen huddled around him, eyes haunted. Rock set Dabbid down.\r\n\u201CFour more,\u201D Kaladin said between gasps. \u201CWe have to find them\u2026.\u201D\r\n\u201CMurk and Leyten,\u201D Teft said. The older bridgeman had been near the back this run, and hadn\u2019t taken any wounds. \u201CAnd Adis and Corl. They were in the front.\u201D\r\nThat\u2019s right,Kaladin thought, exhausted.\r\nHow could I forget\u2026.\u201CMurk is dead,\u201D he said. \u201CThe others might live.\u201D He tried to stumble to his feet.\r\n\u201CIdiot,\u201D Rock said. \u201CStay here. Is all right. I will do this thing.\u201D He hesitated. \u201CGuess I\u2019m an idiot too.\u201D He scowled, but went back out onto the battlefield. Teft hesitated, then chased after him.\r\nKaladin breathed in and out, holding his side. He couldn\u2019t decide if the pain of the arrow impact hurt more than the cut.\r\nSave lives\u2026.\r\nHe crawled over to the three wounded. Hobber\u2014with an arrow through the leg\u2014would wait, and Dabbid had only a broken arm. Gadol was the worst off, with that hole in his side. Kaladin stared at the wound. He didn\u2019t have an operating table; he didn\u2019t even have antiseptic. How was he supposed to do anything?\r\nHe shoved despair aside. \u201COne of you go fetch me a knife,\u201D he told the bridgemen. \u201CTake it off the body of a soldier who has fallen. Someone else build a fire!\u201D\r\nThe bridgemen looked at each other.\r\n\u201CDunny, you get the knife,\u201D Kaladin said as he held his hand to Gadol\u2019s wound, trying to stanch the blood. \u201CNarm, can you make a fire?\u201D\r\n\u201CWith what?\u201D the man asked.\r\nKaladin pulled off his vest and shirt, then handed the shirt to Narm. \u201CUse this as tinder and gather some fallen arrows for wood. Does anyone have flint and steel?\u201D\r\nMoash did, fortunately. You carried anything valuable you had with you on a bridge run; other bridgemen might steal it if you left it behind.\r\n\u201CMove quickly!\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CSomeone else, go rip open a rockbud and get me the watergourd inside.\u201D\r\nThey stood for a few moments. Then, blessedly, they did as he demanded. Perhaps they were too stunned to object. Kaladin tore open Gadol\u2019s shirt, exposing the wound. It was bad, terribly bad. If it had cut the intestines or some of the other organs\u2026\r\nHe ordered one of the bridgemen to hold a bandage to Gadol\u2019s forehead to stanch the smaller blood flow there\u2014anything would help\u2014and inspected the wounded side with the speed his father had taught him. Dunny returned quickly with a knife. Narm was having trouble with the fire, though. The man cursed, trying his flint and steel again.\r\nGadol was spasming. Kaladin pressed bandages to the wound, feeling helpless. There wasn\u2019t a place he could make a tourniquet for a wound like this. There wasn\u2019t anything he could do but\u2014\r\nGadol spit up blood, coughing. \u201CThey break the land itself!\u201D he hissed, eyes wild. \u201CThey want it, but in their rage they will destroy it. Like the jealous man burns his rich things rather than let them be taken by his enemies! They come!\u201D\r\nHe gasped. And then he fell still, his dead eyes staring upward, bloody spittle running in a trail down his cheek. His final, haunting words hung over them. Not far away, soldiers fought and screamed, but the bridgemen were silent.\r\nKaladin sat back, stunned\u2014as always\u2014by the pain of losing someone. His father had always said that time would dull his sensitivity.\r\nIn this, Lirin had been wrong.\r\nHe felt so tired. Rock and Teft were hurrying back toward the cleft in the rock, bearing a body between them.\r\nThey wouldn\u2019t have brought anyone unless he was still alive,Kaladin told himself.\r\nThink of the ones you can help.\u201CKeep that fire going!\u201D he said, pointing at Narm. \u201CDon\u2019t let it die! Someone heat the blade in it.\u201D\r\nNarm jumped, noticing as if for the first time that he\u2019d actually managed to get a small flame started. Kaladin turned away from the dead Gadol and made room for Rock and Teft. They deposited a very bloody Leyten on the ground. He was breathing shallowly and had two arrows sticking from him, one from the shoulder, the other from the opposite arm. Another had grazed his stomach, and the cut there had been widened by movement. It looked like his left leg had been trampled by a horse; it was broken, and he had a large gash where the skin had split.\r\n\u201CThe other three are dead,\u201D Teft said. \u201CHe nearly is too. Nothing much we can do. But you said to bring him, so\u2014\u201D\r\nKaladin knelt down immediately, working with careful, efficient speed. He pressed a bandage against the side, holding it in place with his knee, then tied a quick bandage on the leg, ordering one of the soldiers to hold it firm and elevate the limb. \u201CWhere\u2019s that knife!\u201D Kaladin yelled, hurriedly tying a loose tourniquet around the arm. He needed to stop the blood right now; he\u2019d worry about saving the arm later.\r\nYouthful Dunny rushed over with the heated blade. Kaladin lifted the side bandage and quickly cauterized the wound there. Leyten was unconscious, his breathing growing more shallow.\r\n\u201CYou will\r\nnotdie,\u201D Kaladin muttered. \u201CYou will not die!\u201D His mind was numb, but his fingers knew the motions. For a moment, he was back in his father\u2019s surgery room, listening to careful instruction. He cut the arrow from Leyten\u2019s arm, but left the one in his shoulder, then sent the knife back to be reheated.\r\nPeet finally returned with the watergourd. Kaladin snatched it, using it to clean the leg wound, which was the nastiest, as it had been caused by trampling. When the knife came back, Kaladin pulled the arrow free of the shoulder and cauterized the wound as best he could, then used another of his quickly disappearing bandages to tie the wound.\r\nHe splinted the leg with arrow shafts\u2014the only thing they had. With a grimace, he cauterized the wound there too. He hated to cause so many scars, but he couldn\u2019t afford to let any more blood be lost. He was going to need antiseptic. How soon could he get some of that mucus?\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t you\r\ndaredie!\u201D Kaladin said, barely conscious that he was speaking. He quickly tied off the leg wound, then used his needle and thread to sew the arm wound. He bandaged it, then untied the tourniquet most of the way.\r\nFinally, he settled back, looking at the wounded man, completely drained. Leyten was still breathing. How long would that last? The odds were against him.\r\nThe bridgemen stood or sat around Kaladin, looking strangely reverent. Kaladin tiredly moved over to Hobber and saw to the man\u2019s leg wound. It didn\u2019t need to be cauterized. Kaladin washed it out, cut away some splinters, then sewed it. There were painspren all around the man, tiny orange hands stretching up from the ground.\r\nKaladin sliced off the cleanest portion of bandage he\u2019d used on Gadol and tied it around Hobber\u2019s wound. He hated the uncleanliness of it, but there was no other choice. Then he set Dabbid\u2019s arm with some arrows he had the other bridgemen fetch, using Dabbid\u2019s shirt to tie them in place. Then, finally, Kaladin sat back against the lip of stone, letting out a long, fatigued breath.\r\nBangs of metal on metal and shouts of soldiers rang from behind. He felt\r\nsotired. Too tired to even close his eyes. He just wanted to sit and stare at the ground forever.\r\nTeft settled down beside him. The grizzled man had the watergourd, which still had some liquid in the bottom. \u201CDrink, lad. You need it.\u201D\r\n\u201CWe should clean the wounds of the other men,\u201D Kaladin said numbly. \u201CThey took scrapes\u2014I saw some had cuts\u2014and they should\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CDrink,\u201D Teft said, his crackly voice insistent.\r\nKaladin hesitated, then drank the water. It tasted strongly bitter, like the plant from which it had been taken.\r\n\u201CWhere\u2019d you learn to heal men like that?\u201D Teft asked. Several of the nearby bridgemen turned toward him at the question.\r\n\u201CI wasn\u2019t always a slave,\u201D Kaladin whispered.\r\n\u201CThese things you did, they won\u2019t make a difference,\u201D Rock said, walking up. The massive Horneater squatted down. \u201CGaz makes us leave behind wounded who cannot walk. Is standing order from above.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll deal with Gaz,\u201D Kaladin said, resting his head back against the stone. \u201CGo return that knife to the body you took it off. I don\u2019t want to be accused of thievery. Then, when the time comes to leave, I want two men in charge of Leyten and two men in charge of Hobber. We\u2019ll tie them to the top of the bridge and carry them. At the chasms, you\u2019ll have to move quickly and untie them before the army crosses, then retie them at the end. We\u2019ll also need someone to lead Dabbid, if his shock hasn\u2019t passed.\u201D\r\n\u201CGaz won\u2019t stand for this thing,\u201D Rock said.\r\nKaladin closed his eyes, declining further argument.\r\nThe battle was a long one. As evening approached, the Parshendi finally retreated, jumping away across the chasms with their unnaturally powerful legs. There was a chorus of shouts from the Alethi soldiers, who had won the day. Kaladin forced himself to his feet and went looking for Gaz. It would be a while yet before they could get the chrysalis open\u2014it was like pounding on stone\u2014but he needed to deal with the bridge sergeant.\r\nHe found Gaz watching from well behind the battle lines. He glanced at Kaladin with his one eye. \u201CHow much of that blood is yours?\u201D\r\nKaladin looked down, realizing for the first time that he was crusted with dark, flaking blood, most belonging to the men he\u2019d worked on. He didn\u2019t answer the question. \u201CWe\u2019re taking our wounded with us.\u201D\r\nGaz shook his head. \u201CIf they can\u2019t walk, they stay behind. Standing orders. Not my choice.\u201D\r\n\u201CWe\u2019re taking them,\u201D Kaladin said, no more firm, no more loud.\r\n\u201CBrightlord Lamaril won\u2019t stand for it.\u201D Lamaril was Gaz\u2019s immediate superior.\r\n\u201CYou\u2019ll send Bridge Four last, to lead the wounded soldiers back to camp. Lamaril won\u2019t go with that troop; he\u2019ll go on ahead with the main body, as he won\u2019t want to miss Sadeas\u2019s victory feast.\u201D\r\nGaz opened his mouth.\r\n\u201CMy men will move quickly and efficiently,\u201D Kaladin said, interrupting him. \u201CThey won\u2019t slow anyone.\u201D He took the last sphere from his pocket and handed it over. \u201CYou won\u2019t say anything.\u201D\r\nGaz took the sphere, snorting. \u201COne clearmark? You think that will make me take a risk this big?\u201D\r\n\u201CIf you don\u2019t,\u201D Kaladin said, voice calm, \u201CI will kill you and let them execute me.\u201D\r\nGaz blinked in surprise. \u201CYou\u2019d never\u2014\u201D\r\nKaladin took a single step forward. He must have looked a dreadful sight, covered in blood. Gaz paled. Then he cursed, holding up the dark sphere. \u201CAnd a dun sphere at that.\u201D\r\nKaladin frowned. He was sure it had still glowed before the bridge run. \u201CThat\u2019s your fault. You gave it to me.\u201D\r\n\u201CThose spheres were newly infused last night,\u201D Gaz said. \u201CThey came straight from Brightlord Sadeas\u2019s treasurer. What did you do with them?\u201D\r\nKaladin shook his head, too exhausted to think. Syl landed on his shoulder as he turned to walk back to the bridgemen.\r\n\u201CWhat are they to you?\u201D Gaz called after him. \u201CWhy do you even care?\u201D\r\n\u201CThey\u2019re my men.\u201D\r\nHe left Gaz behind. \u201CI don\u2019t trust him,\u201D Syl said, looking over her shoulder. \u201CHe could just say you threatened him and send men to arrest you.\u201D\r\n\u201CMaybe he will,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CI guess I just have to count on him wanting more of my bribes.\u201D\r\nKaladin continued on, listening to the shouts of the victors and the groans of their wounded. The plateaus were littered with corpses, bunched up along the edges of the chasm, where the bridges had made a focus for the battle. The Parshendi\u2014as always\u2014had left their dead behind. Even when they won, they reportedly left their dead. The humans sent back bridge crews and soldiers to burn their dead and send their spirits to the afterlife, where the best among them would fight in the Heralds\u2019 army.\r\n\u201CSpheres,\u201D Syl said, still looking at Gaz. \u201CThat doesn\u2019t seem like much to count on.\u201D\r\n\u201CMaybe. Maybe not. I\u2019ve seen the way he looks at them. He wants the money I give him. Perhaps badly enough to keep him in line.\u201D Kaladin shook his head. \u201CWhat you said earlier is right; men are unreliable in many things. But if there\u2019s one thing you\r\ncancount on, it\u2019s their greed.\u201D\r\nIt was a bitter thought. But it had been a bitter day. A hopeful, bright beginning, and a bloody, red sunset.\r\nJust like every day."

      "ChapterName": "18: HIGHPRINCE OF WAR",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\nAti was once a kind and generous man, and you saw what became of him. Rayse, on the other hand, was among the most loathsome, crafty, and dangerous individuals I had ever met.\r\n\u201CYeah, this was cut,\u201D the portly leatherworker said, holding up the straps as Adolin watched. \u201CWouldn\u2019t you agree, Yis?\u201D\r\nThe other leatherworker nodded. Yis was a yellow-eyed Iriali, with stark golden hair. Not blond, golden. There was even a metallic sheen to it. He kept it short and wore a cap. Obviously, he didn\u2019t want to draw attention to it. Many considered a lock of Iriali hair to be a ward of good luck.\r\nHis companion, Avaran, was an Alethi darkeyes who wore an apron over his vest. If the two men worked in the traditional way, one would labor on the larger, more robust pieces\u2014like saddles\u2014while the other specialized in fine detail. A group of apprentices toiled in the background, cutting or sewing hogshide.\r\n\u201CSliced,\u201D Yis agreed, taking the straps from Avaran. \u201CI concur.\u201D\r\n\u201CWell hie me to Damnation,\u201D Adolin muttered. \u201CYou mean Elhokar was actually\r\nright?\u201D\r\n\u201CAdolin,\u201D a feminine voice said from behind. \u201CYou said we\u2019d be going on a walk.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s what we\u2019re doing,\u201D he said, turning to smile. Janala stood with arms folded, wearing a sleek yellow dress of impeccable fashion, buttoning up the sides, cupping around the neck with a stiff collar embroidered with crimson thread.\r\n\u201CI had imagined,\u201D she said, \u201Cthat a walk would involve more\r\nwalking.\u201D\r\n\u201CHm,\u201D he said. \u201CYes. We\u2019ll be getting right to that soon. It\u2019ll be grand. Lots of prancing, sauntering, and, er\u2026\u201D\r\n\u201CPromenading?\u201D Yis the leatherworker offered.\r\n\u201CIsn\u2019t that a type of drink?\u201D Adolin asked.\r\n\u201CEr, no, Brightlord. I\u2019m fairly certain it\u2019s another word for walking.\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, then,\u201D Adolin said. \u201CWe\u2019ll do plenty of it too. Promenading. I always love a good promenading.\u201D He rubbed his chin, taking the strap back. \u201CHow certain are you about this strap?\u201D\r\n\u201CThere\u2019s really no room for question, Brightlord,\u201D Avaran said. \u201CThat\u2019s not a simple tear. You should be more careful.\u201D\r\n\u201CCareful?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D Avaran said. \u201CMake sure that no loose buckles are scraping the leather, cutting into it. This looks like it came from a saddle. Sometimes, people let the girth straps hang down when setting the saddle for the night, and they get pinched underneath something. I\u2019d guess that caused the slice.\u201D\r\n\u201COh,\u201D Adolin said. \u201CYou mean it wasn\u2019t cut intentionally?\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, it could have been that,\u201D Avaran said. \u201CBut why would someone cut a girth like this?\u201D\r\nWhy indeed,Adolin thought. He bid farewell to the two leatherworkers, tucked the strap into his pocket, then held out his elbow to Janala. She took it with her freehand, obviously happy to finally be free of the leather-working shop. It had a faint odor about it, though not nearly as bad as a tannery. He\u2019d seen her reaching for her handkerchief a few times, acting as if she wanted to hold it up to her nose.\r\nThey stepped out into the midday sunlight. Tibon and Marks\u2014two lighteyed members of the Cobalt Guard\u2014waited outside with Janala\u2019s handmaiden, Falksi, who was a young Azish darkeyes. The three fell into step behind Adolin and Janala as they walked out onto the street of the warcamp, Falksi muttering under her breath in an accented voice about the lack of a proper palanquin for her mistress.\r\nJanala didn\u2019t seem to mind. She breathed deeply of the open air and clung to his arm. She was quite beautiful, even if she did like to talk about herself. Talkativeness was normally an attribute he was fond of in a woman, but today he had trouble paying attention as Janala began telling him about the latest court gossip.\r\nThe strap had been cut, but the leatherworkers had both assumed that it was the result of an accident. That implied they\u2019d seen cuts like this before. A loose buckle or other mishap slicing the leather.\r\nExcept this time, that cut had thrown the king in the middle of a fight. Could there be something to it?\r\n\u201C\u2026wouldn\u2019t you say, Adolin?\u201D Janala asked.\r\n\u201CUndoubtedly,\u201D he said, listening with half an ear.\r\n\u201CSo you\u2019ll talk to him?\u201D\r\n\u201CHum?\u201D\r\n\u201CYour father. You\u2019ll ask him about letting the men abandon that dreadfully unfashionable uniform once in a while?\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, he\u2019s rather set on the idea,\u201D Adolin said. \u201CBesides, it\u2019s really not\r\nthatunfashionable.\u201D\r\nJanala gave him a flat stare.\r\n\u201CAll right,\u201D he admitted. \u201CIt is a little drab.\u201D Like every other high-ranked lighteyed officer in Dalinar\u2019s army, Adolin wore a simple blue outfit of militaristic cut. A long coat of solid blue\u2014no embroidery\u2014and stiff trousers in a time when vests, silk accents, and scarves were the fashion. His father\u2019s Kholin glyphpair was emblazoned quite obtrusively on the back and breast, and the front fastened with silver buttons up both sides. It was simple, distinctly recognizable, but awfully plain.\r\n\u201CYour father\u2019s men love him, Adolin,\u201D Janala said. \u201CBut his requirements\r\naregrowing tiresome.\u201D\r\n\u201CI know. Trust me. But I don\u2019t think I can change his mind.\u201D How to explain? Despite six years at war, Dalinar wasn\u2019t weakening in his resolve to hold to the Codes. If anything, his dedication to them was strengthening.\r\nAt least now Adolin understood somewhat. Dalinar\u2019s beloved brother had made one last request: Follow the Codes. True, that request had been in reference to a single event, but Adolin\u2019s father was known to take things to extremes.\r\nAdolin just wished he wouldn\u2019t make the same requirement of everyone else. Individually, the Codes were only minor inconveniences\u2014always be in uniform when in public, never be drunken, avoid dueling. In aggregate, however, they were burdensome.\r\nHis response to Janala was cut off as a set of horns blared through the camp. Adolin perked up, spinning, looking eastward toward the Shattered Plains. He counted off the next series of horns. A chrysalis had been spotted on plateau one-forty-seven. That was within striking distance!\r\nHe held his breath, waiting for a third series of horns to blare, calling Dalinar\u2019s armies to battle. That would only happen if his father ordered it.\r\nPart of him knew those horns wouldn\u2019t come. One-forty-seven was close enough to Sadeas\u2019s warcamp that the other highprince would certainly try for it.\r\nCome on, Father,Adolin thought.\r\nWe can race him for it!\r\nNo horns came.\r\nAdolin glanced at Janala. She\u2019d chosen music as her Calling and paid little attention to the war, though her father was one of Dalinar\u2019s cavalry officers. From her expression, Adolin could tell that even she understood what the lack of a third horn meant.\r\nOnce again, Dalinar Kholin had chosen not to fight.\r\n\u201CCome on,\u201D Adolin said, turning and moving in another direction, practically towing Janala along by her elbow. \u201CThere\u2019s something else I want to check into.\u201D\r\nDalinar stood with hands clasped behind his back, looking out over the Shattered Plains. He was on one of the lower terraces outside Elhokar\u2019s elevated palace\u2014the king didn\u2019t reside in one of the ten warcamps, but in a small compound elevated along a hillside nearby. Dalinar\u2019s climb to the palace had been interrupted by the horns.\r\nHe stood long enough see Sadeas\u2019s army gathering inside his camp. Dalinar could have sent a soldier to prepare his own men. He was close enough.\r\n\u201CBrightlord?\u201D a voice asked from the side. \u201CDo you wish to continue?\u201D\r\nYou protect him your way, Sadeas,Dalinar thought.\r\nI\u2019ll protect him my way.\r\n\u201CYes, Teshav,\u201D he said, turning to continue walking up the switchbacks.\r\nTeshav joined him. She had streaks of blond in her otherwise black Alethi hair, which she wore up in an intricate crossing weave. She had violet eyes, and her pinched face bore a concerned expression. That was normal; she always seemed to need something to worry about.\r\nTeshav and her attendant scribe were both wives of his officers. Dalinar trusted them. Mostly. It was hard to trust anyone completely.\r\nStop it,he thought.\r\nYou\u2019re starting to sound as paranoid as the king.\r\nRegardless, he\u2019d be very glad for Jasnah\u2019s return. If she ever decided to return. Some of his higher officers hinted to him that he should marry again, if only to have a woman who could be his primary scribe. They thought he rejected their suggestions because of love for his first wife. They didn\u2019t know that she was gone, vanished from his mind, a blank patch of fog in his memory. Though, in a way, his officers were right. He hesitated to remarry because he hated the idea of replacing her. He\u2019d had everything of his wife taken from him. All that remained was the hole, and filling it to gain a scribe seemed callous.\r\nDalinar continued on his way. Other than the two women, he was attended by Renarin and three members of the Cobalt Guard. The latter wore deep blue felt caps and cloaks over silvery breastplates and deep blue trousers. They were lighteyes of low rank, able to carry swords for close fighting.\r\n\u201CWell, Brightlord,\u201D Teshav said, \u201CBrightlord Adolin asked me to report the progress of the saddle girth investigation. He\u2019s speaking with leatherworkers at this very moment, but so far, there is very little to say. Nobody witnessed anyone interfering with the saddle or His Majesty\u2019s horse. Our spies say there are no whispers of anyone in the other warcamps bragging, and nobody in our camp has suddenly received large sums of money, so far as we\u2019ve discovered.\u201D\r\n\u201CThe grooms?\u201D\r\n\u201CSay they checked over the saddle,\u201D she said, \u201Cbut when pressed, they admit that they can\u2019t\r\nspecificallyremember checking the girth.\u201D She shook her head. \u201CCarrying a Shardbearer places great strain on both horse and saddle. If there were only some way to tame more Ryshadium\u2026.\u201D\r\n\u201CI think you\u2019ll sooner tame the highstorms, Brightness. Well, this is good news, I suppose. Better for us all that this strap business turns out to be nothing. Now, there is another item I wish you to look into.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt is my pleasure to serve, Brightlord.\u201D\r\n\u201CHighprince Aladar has begun to talk of taking a short vacation back to Alethkar. I want to know if he\u2019s serious.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes, Brightlord.\u201D Teshav nodded. \u201CWould that be a problem?\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m honestly not sure.\u201D He didn\u2019t trust the highprinces, but at least with them all here, he could watch them. If one of them returned to Alethkar, the man could scheme unchecked. Of course, even brief visits might help stabilize their homeland.\r\nWhich was more important? Stability or the ability to watch over the others?\r\nBlood of my fathers,he thought.\r\nI wasn\u2019t made for this politicking and scheming. I was made to wield a sword and ride down enemies.\r\nHe\u2019d do what needed to be done anyway. \u201CI believe you said you had information on the king\u2019s accounts, Teshav?\u201D\r\n\u201CIndeed,\u201D she said as they continued the short hike. \u201CYou were correct to have me look into the ledgers, as it appears that three of the highprinces\u2014Thanadal, Hatham, and Vamah\u2014are well behind in their payments. Other than yourself, only Highprince Sadeas has actually paid ahead on what is owed, as the tenets of war require.\u201D\r\nDalinar nodded. \u201CThe longer this war stretches, the more comfortable the highprinces are getting. They\u2019re starting to question. Why pay high war time rates for Soulcasting? Why not move farmers out here and start growing their own food?\u201D\r\n\u201CPardon, Brightlord,\u201D Teshav said as they turned around a switchback. Her attendant scribe walked behind, several ledgers clipped to boards carried in a satchel. \u201CBut do we really wish to discourage that? A second stream of supplies could be valuable as a redundancy.\u201D\r\n\u201CThe merchants already provide redundancy,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CWhich is one of the reasons I haven\u2019t chased them off. I wouldn\u2019t mind another, but the Soulcasters are the only hold we have on the highprinces. They owed Gavilar loyalty, but they feel little of that for his son.\u201D Dalinar narrowed his eyes. \u201CThis is a vital point, Teshav. Have you read the histories I suggested?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes, Brightlord.\u201D\r\n\u201CThen you know. The most fragile period in a kingdom\u2019s existence comes during the lifetime of its founder\u2019s heir. During the reign of a man like Gavilar, men stay loyal because of their respect for him. During subsequent generations, men begin to see themselves as part of a kingdom, a united force that holds together because of tradition.\r\n\u201CBut the son\u2019s reign\u2026that\u2019s the dangerous point. Gavilar isn\u2019t here to hold everyone together, but there isn\u2019t yet a tradition of Alethkar being a kingdom. We\u2019ve\r\ngotto carry on long enough for the highprinces to begin seeing themselves as part of a greater whole.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes, Brightlord.\u201D\r\nShe didn\u2019t question. Teshav was deeply loyal to him, as were most of his officers. They didn\u2019t question why it was so important to him that the ten princedoms regard themselves as one nation. Perhaps they assumed it was because of Gavilar. Indeed, his brother\u2019s dream of a united Alethkar was part of it. There was something else, though.\r\nThe Everstorm comes. The True Desolation. The Night of Sorrows.\r\nHe suppressed a shiver. The visions certainly didn\u2019t make it sound like he had a great deal of time to prepare.\r\n\u201CDraft a missive in the king\u2019s name,\u201D Dalinar said, \u201Cdecreasing Soulcasting costs for those who have made their payments on time. That should wake up the others. Give it to Elhokar\u2019s scribes and have them explain it to him. Hopefully he will agree with the need.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes, Brightlord,\u201D Teshav said. \u201CIf I might note, I was quite surprised that you suggested I read those histories. In the past, such things haven\u2019t been particular to your interests.\u201D\r\n\u201CI do a lot of things lately that aren\u2019t particular to my interests or my talents,\u201D Dalinar said with a grimace. \u201CMy lack of capacity doesn\u2019t change the kingdom\u2019s needs. Have you gathered reports of banditry in the area?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes, Brightlord.\u201D She hesitated. \u201CThe rates are quite alarming.\u201D\r\n\u201CTell your husband I give him command of the Fourth Battalion,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CI want the two of you to work out a better pattern of patrol in the Unclaimed Hills. So long as the Alethi monarchy has a presence here, I do\r\nnotwant it to be a land of lawlessness.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes, Brightlord,\u201D Teshav said, sounding hesitant. \u201CYou realize that means you\u2019ve committed two entire battalions to patrolling?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D Dalinar said. He had asked for help from the other highprinces. Their reactions had ranged from shock to mirth. None had given him any soldiers.\r\n\u201CThat is added to the battalion you assigned to peacekeeping in the areas between warcamps and the exterior merchant markets,\u201D Teshav added. \u201CIn total, that\u2019s over a quarter of your forces here, Brightlord.\u201D\r\n\u201CThe orders stand, Teshav.\u201D he said. \u201CSee to it. But first, I have more to discuss with you regarding the ledgers. Go on ahead to the ledger room and wait for us there.\u201D\r\nShe nodded respect. \u201COf course, Brightlord.\u201D She withdrew with her ward.\r\nRenarin stepped up to Dalinar. \u201CShe wasn\u2019t pleased about that, Father.\u201D\r\n\u201CShe wishes her husband to be fighting,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CThey all hope that I\u2019ll win another Shardblade out there, then give it to them.\u201D The Parshendi had Shards. Not many, but even a single one was surprising. Nobody had an explanation for where they\u2019d gotten them. Dalinar had won a Parshendi Shardblade and Plate during his first year here. He\u2019d given both to Elhokar to award to a warrior he felt would be the most useful to Alethkar and the war effort.\r\nDalinar turned and entered the palace proper. The guards at the doorway saluted him and Renarin. The young man kept his eyes forward, staring at nothing. Some people thought him emotionless, but Dalinar knew he was just preoccupied.\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve been meaning to speak with you, son,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CAbout the hunt last week.\u201D\r\nRenarin\u2019s eyes flickered downward in shame, the edges of his mouth pulling back in a grimace. Yes, he\r\ndidhave emotions. He just didn\u2019t show them as often as others.\r\n\u201CYou realize that you shouldn\u2019t have rushed into battle as you did,\u201D Dalinar said sternly. \u201CThat chasmfiend could have killed you.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat would you have done, Father, if it had been me in danger?\u201D\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t fault your bravery; I fault your wisdom. What if you\u2019d had one of your fits?\u201D\r\n\u201CThen perhaps the monster would have swept me off the plateau,\u201D Renarin said bitterly, \u201Cand I would no longer be such a useless drain on everyone\u2019s time.\u201D\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t say such things! Not even in jest.\u201D\r\n\u201CWas it jest? Father, I can\u2019t fight.\u201D\r\n\u201CFighting is not the only thing of value a man can do.\u201D The ardents were very specific about that. Yes, the highest Calling of men was to join the battle in the afterlife to reclaim the Tranquiline Halls, but the Almighty accepted the excellence of any man or woman, regardless of what they did.\r\nYou just did your best, picking a profession and an attribute of the Almighty to emulate. A Calling and a Glory, it was said. You worked hard at your profession, and you spent your life trying to live according to a single ideal. The Almighty would accept that, particularly if you were lighteyed\u2014the better your blood as a lighteyes, the more innate Glory you had already.\r\nDalinar\u2019s Calling was to be a leader, and his chosen Glory was determination. He\u2019d chosen both in his youth, though he now viewed them very differently than he once had.\r\n\u201CYou are right, of course, Father,\u201D Renarin said. \u201CI am not the first hero\u2019s son to be born without any talent for warfare. The others all got along. So shall I. Likely I will end up as citylord of a small town. Assuming I don\u2019t tuck myself away in the devotaries.\u201D The boy\u2019s eyes turned forward.\r\nI still think of him as \u201Cthe boy,\u201DDalinar thought.\r\nEven though he\u2019s now in his twentieth year.Wit had been right. Dalinar underestimated Renarin.\r\nHow would I react, if I were forbidden to fight? Kept back with the women and the merchants?\r\nDalinar would have been bitter, particularly against Adolin. In fact, Dalinar\r\nhadoften been envious of Gavilar during their boyhood. Renarin, however, was Adolin\u2019s greatest supporter. He all but worshipped his elder brother. And he was brave enough to dash heedless into the middle of a battlefield where a nightmare creature was smashing spearmen and tossing aside Shardbearers.\r\nDalinar cleared his throat. \u201CPerhaps it is time to again try training you in the sword.\u201D\r\n\u201CMy blood weakness\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CWon\u2019t matter a bit if we get you into a set of Plate and give you a Blade,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CThe armor makes any man strong, and a Shardblade is nearly as light as air itself.\u201D\r\n\u201CFather,\u201D Renarin said flatly, \u201CI\u2019ll never be a Shardbearer. You yourself have said that the Blades and Plate we win from the Parshendi must go to the most skilled warriors.\u201D\r\n\u201CNone of the other highprinces give up their spoils to the king,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CAnd who would fault me if, for once, I made a gift to my son?\u201D\r\nRenarin stopped in the hallway, displaying an unusual level of emotion, eyes opening wider, face eager. \u201CYou are serious?\u201D\r\n\u201CI give you my oath, son. If I can capture another Blade and Plate, they will go to you.\u201D He smiled. \u201CTo be honest, I\u2019d do it simply for the joy of seeing Sadeas\u2019s face when you become a full Shardbearer. Beyond that, if your strength is made equal to others, I expect that your natural skill will make you shine.\u201D\r\nRenarin smiled. Shardplate wouldn\u2019t solve everything, but Renarin would have his chance. Dalinar would see to it.\r\nI know what it\u2019s like to be a second son,he thought as they continued walking toward the king\u2019s chambers,\r\novershadowed by an older brother you love yet envy at the same time. Stormfather, but I do.\r\nI still feel that way.\r\n\u201CAh, good Brightlord Adolin,\u201D the ardent said, walking forward with open arms. Kadash was a tall man in his later years, and wore the shaved head and square beard of his Calling. He also had a twisting scar that ran around the top of his head, a memento from his earlier days as an army officer.\r\nIt was uncommon to find a man such as him\u2014a lighteyes who had once been a soldier\u2014in the ardentia. In fact, it was odd for any man to change his Calling. But it wasn\u2019t forbidden, and Kadash had risen far in the ardentia considering his late start. Dalinar said it was a sign of either faith or perseverance. Perhaps both.\r\nThe warcamp\u2019s temple had started as a large Soulcast dome, then Dalinar had granted money and stonemasons to transform it into a more suitable house of worship. Carvings of the Heralds now lined the inside walls, and broad windows carved on the leeward side had been set with glass to let in the light. Diamond spheres blazed in bunches hung from the high ceiling, and stands had been set up for the instruction, practice, and testing of the various arts.\r\nMany women were in at the moment, receiving instruction from the ardents. There were fewer men. Being at war, it was easy to practice the masculine arts in the field.\r\nJanala folded her arms, scanning the temple with obvious dissatisfaction as she stood beside Adolin. \u201CFirst a stinky leatherworker\u2019s shop, now the temple? I had assumed we would walk someplace at least\r\nfaintlyromantic.\u201D\r\n\u201CReligion\u2019s romantic,\u201D Adolin said, scratching his head. \u201CEternal love and all that, right?\u201D\r\nShe eyed him. \u201CI\u2019m going to go wait outside.\u201D She turned and walked out with her handmaiden. \u201CAnd someone get me a storming palanquin.\u201D\r\nAdolin frowned, watching her go. \u201CI\u2019ll have to buy her something quite expensive to make up for this, I suspect.\u201D\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t see what the problem is,\u201D Kadash said. \u201C\r\nIthink religion is romantic.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou\u2019re an ardent,\u201D Adolin said flatly. \u201CBesides, that scar makes you a little too unsightly for my tastes.\u201D He sighed. \u201CIt\u2019s not so much the temple that has set her off, but my lack of attention. I haven\u2019t been a very good companion today.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou have matters pressing upon your mind, bright one?\u201D Kadash asked. \u201CIs this about your Calling? You haven\u2019t made much progress lately.\u201D\r\nAdolin grimaced. His chosen Calling was dueling. By working with the ardents to make personal goals and fulfill them, he could prove himself to the Almighty. Unfortunately, during war, the Codes said Adolin was supposed to limit his duels, as frivolous dueling could wound officers who might be needed in battle.\r\nBut Adolin\u2019s father avoided battle more and more. So what was the point of not dueling? \u201CHoly one,\u201D Adolin said, \u201Cwe need to speak somewhere we can\u2019t be overheard.\u201D\r\nKadash raised an eyebrow and led Adolin around the central apex. Vorin temples were always circular with a gently sloping mound at the center, by custom rising ten feet high. The building was dedicated to the Almighty, maintained by Dalinar and the ardents he owned. All devotaries were welcome to use it, though most would have their own chapter houses in one of the warcamps.\r\n\u201CWhat is it you wish to ask of me, bright one?\u201D the ardent asked once they reached a more secluded section of the vast chamber. Kadash was deferential, though he had tutored and trained Adolin during his childhood.\r\n\u201CIs my father going mad?\u201D Adolin asked. \u201COr could he really be seeing visions sent by the Almighty, as I think he believes?\u201D\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s a rather blunt question.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou\u2019ve known him longer than most, Kadash, and I know you to be loyal. I also know you to be one who keeps his ears open and notices things, so I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard the rumors.\u201D Adolin shrugged. \u201CSeems like a time for bluntness if there ever was one.\u201D\r\n\u201CI take it, then, the rumors are not unfounded.\u201D\r\n\u201CUnfortunately, no. It happens during every highstorm. He raves and thrashes about, and afterward claims to have seen things.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat sorts of things?\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m not certain, precisely.\u201D Adolin grimaced. \u201CThings about the Radiants. And perhaps\u2026about what is to come.\u201D\r\nKadash looked disturbed. \u201CThis is dangerous territory, bright one. What you are asking me about risks tempting me to violate my oaths. I am an ardent, owned by and loyal to your father.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut he is not your religious superior.\u201D\r\n\u201CNo. But he\r\nisthe Almighty\u2019s guardian of this people, set to watch me and make certain I don\u2019t rise above my station.\u201D Kadash pursed his lips. \u201CIt is a delicate balance we walk, bright one. Do you know much of the Hierocracy, the War of Loss?\u201D\r\n\u201CThe church tried to seize control,\u201D Adolin said, shrugging. \u201CThe priests tried to conquer the world\u2014for its own good, they claimed.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat was part of it,\u201D Kadash said. \u201CThe part we speak of most often. But the problem goes much deeper. The church back then, it clung to knowledge. Men were not in command of their own religious paths; the priests controlled the doctrine, and few members of the Church were allowed to know theology. They were taught to follow the priests. Not the Almighty or the Heralds, but the priests.\u201D\r\nHe began walking, leading Adolin around the back rim of the temple chamber. They passed statues of the Heralds, five male, five female. In truth, Adolin knew very little of what Kadash was saying. He\u2019d never had much of a mind for history that didn\u2019t relate directly to the command of armies.\r\n\u201CThe problem, bright one,\u201D Kadash said, \u201Cwas mysticism. The priests claimed that common men could not understand religion or the Almighty. Where there should have been openness, there was smoke and whispers. The priests began to claim visions and prophecies, though such things had been denounced by the Heralds themselves. Voidbinding is a dark and evil thing, and the soul of it was to try to divine the future.\u201D\r\nAdolin froze. \u201CWait, you\u2019re saying\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t get ahead of me please, bright one,\u201D Kadash assured, turning back toward him. \u201CWhen the priests of the Hierocracy were cast down, the Sunmaker made a point of interrogating them and going through their correspondences with one another. It was discovered that there\r\nhadbeen no prophecies. No mystical promises from the Almighty. That had all been an excuse, fabricated by the priests to placate and control the people.\u201D\r\nAdolin frowned. \u201CWhere are you going with this, Kadash?\u201D\r\n\u201CAs close as I dare to the truth, bright one,\u201D the ardent said. \u201CAs I cannot be as blunt as you.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou think my father\u2019s visions are fabrications, then.\u201D\r\n\u201CI would never accuse my highprince of lying,\u201D Kadash said. \u201COr even of feebleness. But neither can I condone mysticism or prophecy in any form. To do so would be to deny Vorinism. The days of the priests are gone. The days of lying to the people, of keeping them in darkness, are gone. Now, each man chooses his own path, and the ardents help him achieve closeness to the Almighty through it. Instead of shadowed prophecies and pretend powers held by a few, we have a population who understand their beliefs and their relationship with their God.\u201D\r\nHe stepped closer, speaking very softly. \u201CYour father is not to be mocked or diminished. If his visions are true, then it is between him and the Almighty. All I can say is this: I know something of what it is to be haunted by the death and destruction of war. I see in your father\u2019s eyes much of what I have felt, but worse. My personal opinion is that the things he sees are likely more a reflection of his past than any mystical experience.\u201D\r\n\u201CSo he is going mad,\u201D Adolin whispered.\r\n\u201CI did not say that.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou implied that the Almighty probably wouldn\u2019t send visions like these.\u201D\r\n\u201CI did.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd that his visions are a product of his own mind.\u201D\r\n\u201C\r\nLikelyso,\u201D the ardent said, raising his finger. \u201CA delicate balance, you see. One that is particularly difficult to keep when speaking to my highprince\u2019s own son.\u201D He reached out, taking Adolin\u2019s arm. \u201CIf any are to help him, it must be you. It would not be the place of any other, even myself.\u201D\r\nAdolin nodded slowly. \u201CThank you.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou should likely go see to that young woman now.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D Adolin said with a sigh. \u201CI fear that even with the right gift, she and I are not long for courting. Renarin will mock me again.\u201D\r\nKadash smiled. \u201CBest not to give up so easily, bright one. Go now. But do return sometime so we can speak of your goals in regard to your Calling. It has been too long since you\u2019ve Elevated.\u201D\r\nAdolin nodded and hurried from the chamber.\r\nAfter hours going over the ledgers with Teshav, Dalinar and Renarin reached the hallway before the king\u2019s chambers. They walked in silence, the soles of their boots clapping the marble flooring, the sound echoing against stone walls.\r\nThe corridors of the king\u2019s war palace were growing richer by the week. Once, this hallway had been just another Soulcast stone tunnel. As Elhokar settled in, he had ordered improvements. Windows were cut into the leeward side. Marble tiling was set into the floor. The walls were carved with reliefs, with mosaic trim at the corners. Dalinar and Renarin passed a group of stonemasons carefully cutting a scene of Nalan\u2019Elin, emitting sunlight, the sword of retribution held over his head.\r\nThey reached the king\u2019s antechamber, a large, open room guarded by ten members of the King\u2019s Guard, dressed in blue and gold. Dalinar recognized each face; he had personally organized the unit, handpicking its members.\r\nHighprince Ruthar waited to see the king. He had brawny arms folded in front of him, and wore a short black beard that surrounded his mouth. The red silk coat was cut short and did not button; almost more of a sleeved vest, it was a mere token nod to traditional Alethi uniform. The shirt underneath was ruffled and white, and his blue trousers were loose, with wide cuffs.\r\nRuthar glanced Dalinar\u2019s way and nodded to him\u2014a minor token of respect\u2014then turned to chat with one of his attendants. He cut off, however, as the guards at the doorway stepped aside to let Dalinar enter. Ruthar sniffed in annoyance. Dalinar\u2019s easy access to the king galled the other highprinces.\r\nThe king wasn\u2019t in his wardroom, but the wide doors to his balcony were open. Dalinar\u2019s guardsmen waited behind as he stepped out onto the balcony, Renarin hesitantly following. The light outside was dimming as sunset neared. Setting the war palace up high like this was tactically sound, but it meant the place was mercilessly buffeted by storms. That was an old campaign conundrum. Did one choose the best position to weather storms, or did one seize the high ground?\r\nMost would have chosen the former; their warcamps on the edge of the Shattered Plains were unlikely to be attacked, making the advantage of the high ground less important. But kings tended to prefer height. In this instance, Dalinar had encouraged Elhokar, just in case.\r\nThe balcony itself was a thick platform of rock cut onto the top of the small peak, edged with an iron railing. The king\u2019s rooms were a Soulcast dome sitting atop the natural formation, with covered ramps and stairways leading to tiers lower on the hillside. Those housed the king\u2019s various attendants: guards, stormwardens, ardents, and distant family members. Dalinar had his own bunker at his warcamp. He refused to call it a palace.\r\nThe king leaned against the railing, two guards watching from a distance. Dalinar motioned for Renarin to join them, so that he could speak with the king in private.\r\nThe air was cool\u2014spring having come for a time\u2014and it was sweet with the scents of evening: blooming rockbuds and wet stone. Below, the warcamps were starting to come alight, ten sparkling circles filled with watchfires, cookfires, lamps, and the steady glow of infused gems. Elhokar stared over the camps and toward the Shattered Plains. They were utterly dark, save for the occasional twinkle of a watchpost.\r\n\u201CDo they watch us, from out there?\u201D Elhokar asked as Dalinar joined him.\r\n\u201CWe know their raiding bands move at night, Your Majesty,\u201D Dalinar said, resting one hand on the iron railing. \u201CI can\u2019t help but think they watch us.\u201D\r\nThe king\u2019s uniform had the traditional long coat with buttons up the sides, but it was loose and relaxed, and ruffled lace poked out of the collar and cuffs. His trousers were solid blue, and were cut in the same baggy fashion as Ruthar\u2019s. It all looked so informal to Dalinar. Increasingly, their soldiers were being led by a slack group who dressed in lace and spent their evenings at feasts.\r\nThis is what Gavilar foresaw,Dalinar thought.\r\nThis is why he grew so insistent that we follow the Codes.\r\n\u201CYou look thoughtful, Uncle,\u201D Elhokar said.\r\n\u201CJust considering the past, Your Majesty.\u201D\r\n\u201CThe past is irrelevant. I only look forward.\u201D\r\nDalinar was not certain he agreed with either statement.\r\n\u201CI sometimes think I should be able to see the Parshendi,\u201D Elhokar said. \u201CI feel that if I stare long enough, I will find them, pin them down so I can challenge them. I wish they\u2019d just fight me, like men of honor.\u201D\r\n\u201CIf they were men of honor,\u201D Dalinar said, clasping his hands behind his back, \u201Cthen they would not have killed your father as they did.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhy did they do it, do you suppose?\u201D\r\nDalinar shook his head. \u201CThat question has churned in my head, over and over, like a boulder tumbling down a hill. Did we offend their honor? Was it some cultural misunderstanding?\u201D\r\n\u201CA cultural misunderstanding would imply that they\r\nhavea culture. Primitive brutes. Who knows why a horse kicks or an axehound bites? I shouldn\u2019t have asked.\u201D\r\nDalinar didn\u2019t reply. He\u2019d felt that same disdain, that same anger, in the months following Gavilar\u2019s assassination. He could understand Elhokar\u2019s desire to dismiss these strange, wildland parshmen as little more than animals.\r\nBut he\u2019d\r\nseenthem during those early days. Interacted with them. They were primitive, yes, but not brutes. Not stupid.\r\nWe never really understood them,he thought.\r\nI guess that\u2019s the crux of the problem.\r\n\u201CElhokar,\u201D he said softly. \u201CIt may be time to ask ourselves some difficult questions.\u201D\r\n\u201CSuch as?\u201D\r\n\u201CSuch as how long we will continue this war.\u201D\r\nElhokar started. He turned, looking at Dalinar. \u201CWe\u2019ll keep fighting until the Vengeance Pact is satisfied and my father is avenged!\u201D\r\n\u201CNoble words,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CBut we\u2019ve been away from Alethkar for six years now. Maintaining two far-flung centers of government is not healthy for the kingdom.\u201D\r\n\u201CKings often go to war for extended periods, Uncle.\u201D\r\n\u201CRarely do they do it for so long,\u201D Dalinar said, \u201Cand rarely do they bring every Shardbearer and Highprince in the kingdom with them. Our resources are strained, and word from home is that the Reshi border encroachments grow increasingly bold. We are still fragmented as a people, slow to trust one another, and the nature of this extended war\u2014without a clear path to victory and with a focus on riches rather than capturing ground\u2014is not helping at all.\u201D\r\nElhokar sniffed, wind blowing at them atop the peaked rock. \u201CYou say there\u2019s no clear path to victory? We\u2019ve been winning! The Parshendi raids are coming less frequently, and aren\u2019t striking as far westward as they once did. We\u2019ve killed thousands of them in battle.\u201D\r\n\u201CNot enough,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CThey still come in strength. The siege is straining us as much as, or more than, it is them.\u201D\r\n\u201CWeren\u2019t\r\nyouthe one to suggest this tactic in the first place?\u201D\r\n\u201CI was a different man, then, flush with grief and anger.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd you no longer feel those things?\u201D Elhokar was incredulous. \u201CUncle, I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m hearing this! You aren\u2019t\r\nseriouslysuggesting that I abandon the war, are you? You\u2019d have me slink home, like a scolded axehound?\u201D\r\n\u201CI said they were difficult questions, Your Majesty,\u201D Dalinar said, keeping his anger in check. It was taxing. \u201CBut they\r\nmustbe considered.\u201D\r\nElhokar breathed out, annoyed. \u201CIt\u2019s true, what Sadeas and the others whisper. You\u2019re changing, Uncle. It has something to do with those episodes of yours, doesn\u2019t it?\u201D\r\n\u201CThey are unimportant, Elhokar. Listen to me! What are we willing to give, in order to get vengeance?\u201D\r\n\u201CAnything.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd if that means everything your father worked for? Do we honor his memory by undermining his vision for Alethkar, all to get revenge in his name?\u201D\r\nThe king hesitated.\r\n\u201CYou pursue the Parshendi,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CThat is laudable. But you can\u2019t let your passion for just retribution blind you to the needs of our kingdom. The Vengeance Pact has kept the highprinces channeled, but what will happen once we win? Will we shatter? I think we need to forge them together, to unite them. We fight this war as if we were ten different nations, fighting beside one another but not\r\nwithone another.\u201D\r\nThe king didn\u2019t respond immediately. The words, finally, seemed to be sinking in. He was a good man, and shared more with his father than others chose to admit.\r\nHe turned away from Dalinar, leaning against the railing. \u201CYou think I\u2019m a poor king, don\u2019t you, Uncle?\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat? Of course not!\u201D\r\n\u201CYou always talk about what I\r\nshouldbe doing, and where I am lacking. Tell me truthfully, Uncle. When you look at me, do you wish you saw my father\u2019s face instead?\u201D\r\n\u201COf course I do,\u201D Dalinar said.\r\nElhokar\u2019s expression darkened.\r\nDalinar laid a hand on his nephew\u2019s shoulder. \u201CI\u2019d be a poor brother if I didn\u2019t wish that Gavilar had lived. I failed him\u2014it was the greatest, most terrible failure of my life.\u201D Elhokar turned to him, and Dalinar held his gaze, raising a finger. \u201CBut just because I loved your father does\r\nnotmean that I think you are a failure. Nor does it mean I do not love you in your own right. Alethkar itself could have collapsed upon Gavilar\u2019s death, but\r\nyouorganized and executed our counterattack. You are a fine king.\u201D\r\nThe king nodded slowly. \u201CYou\u2019ve been listening to readings from that book again, haven\u2019t you?\u201D\r\n\u201CI have.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou sound like him, you know,\u201D Elhokar said, turning back to look eastward again. \u201CNear the end. When he began to act\u2026erratically.\u201D\r\n\u201CSurely I\u2019m not so bad as that.\u201D\r\n\u201CPerhaps. But this is much like how he was. Talking about an end to war, fascinated by the Lost Radiants, insisting everyone follow the Codes\u2026\u201D\r\nDalinar remembered those days\u2014and his own arguments with Gavilar.\r\nWhat honor can we find on a battlefield while our people starve?the king had once asked him.\r\nIs it honor when our lighteyes plot and scheme like eels in a bucket, slithering over one another and trying to bite each other\u2019s tails?\r\nDalinar had reacted poorly to his words. Just as Elhokar was reacting to his words now.\r\nStormfather! Iam\r\nstarting to sound like him, aren\u2019t I?\r\nThat was troubling, yet somehow encouraging at the same time. Either way, Dalinar realized something. Adolin was right. Elhokar\u2014and the highprinces with him\u2014would never respond to a suggestion that they retreat. Dalinar was approaching the conversation in the wrong way.\r\nAlmighty be blessed for sending me a son willing to speak his mind.\r\n\u201CPerhaps you are right, Your Majesty,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CEnd the war? Leave a battlefield with an enemy still in control? That would shame us.\u201D\r\nElhokar nodded in agreement. \u201CI\u2019m glad you see sense.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut something\r\ndoeshave to change. We need a better way to fight.\u201D\r\n\u201CSadeas has a better way already. I spoke of his bridges to you. They work so well, and he\u2019s captured so many gemhearts.\u201D\r\n\u201CGemhearts are meaningless,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201C\r\nAllof this is meaningless if we don\u2019t find a way to get the vengeance we all want. You can\u2019t tell me you enjoy watching the highprinces squabble, practically ignoring our real purpose in being here.\u201D\r\nElhokar fell silent, looking displeased.\r\nUnite them. He remembered those words, booming in his head. \u201CElhokar,\u201D he said, an idea occurring to him. \u201CDo you remember what Sadeas and I spoke of to you when we first came here to war? The specialization of the highprinces?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D Elhokar said. In the distant past, each of the ten highprinces in Alethkar had been given a specific charge for the governing of the kingdom. One had been the ultimate law in regard to merchants, and his troops had patrolled the roadways of all ten princedoms. Another had administrated judges and magistrates.\r\nGavilar had been very taken by the idea. He claimed it was a clever device, meant to force the highprinces to work together. Once, this system had forced them to submit to one another\u2019s authority. Things hadn\u2019t been done that way in centuries, ever since the fragmenting of Alethkar into ten\u00A0autonomous princedoms.\r\n\u201CElhokar, what if you named me Highprince of War?\u201D Dalinar asked.\r\nElhokar didn\u2019t laugh; that was a good sign. \u201CI thought you and Sadeas decided that the others would revolt if we tried something like that.\u201D\r\n\u201CPerhaps I was wrong about that too.\u201D\r\nElhokar appeared to consider it. Finally, the king shook his head. \u201CNo. They barely accept my leadership. If I did something like this, they\u2019d assassinate me.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019d protect you.\u201D\r\n\u201CBah. You don\u2019t even take the\r\npresentthreats on my life seriously.\u201D\r\nDalinar sighed. \u201CYour Majesty, I\r\ndotake threats to your life seriously. My scribes and attendants are looking into the strap.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd what have they discovered?\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, so far we have nothing conclusive. Nobody has taken credit for trying to kill you, even in rumor. Nobody saw anything suspicious. But Adolin is speaking with leatherworkers. Perhaps he\u2019ll bring something more substantial.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\r\nwascut, Uncle.\u201D\r\n\u201CWe will see.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou don\u2019t believe me,\u201D Elhokar said, face growing red. \u201CYou should be trying to find out what the assassins\u2019 plan was, rather than pestering me with some arrogant quest to become overlord of the entire army!\u201D\r\nDalinar gritted his teeth. \u201CI do this for you, Elhokar.\u201D\r\nElhokar met his eyes for a moment, and his blue eyes flashed with suspicion again, as they had the week before.\r\nBlood of my fathers!Dalinar thought.\r\nHe\u2019s getting worse.\r\nElhokar\u2019s expression softened a moment later, and he seemed to relax. Whatever he\u2019d seen in Dalinar\u2019s eyes had comforted him. \u201CI know you try for the best, Uncle,\u201D Elhokar said. \u201CBut you have to admit that you\u2019ve been erratic lately. The way you react to storms, your infatuation with my father\u2019s last words\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m trying to understand him.\u201D\r\n\u201CHe grew weak at the end,\u201D Elhokar said. \u201CEveryone knows it. I won\u2019t repeat his mistakes, and you should avoid them as well\u2014rather than listening to a book that claims that lighteyes should be the slaves of the darkeyes.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s\r\nnotwhat it says,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CIt has been misinterpreted. It\u2019s mostly just a collection of stories which teach that a leader should serve those he leads.\u201D\r\n\u201CBah. It was written by the Lost Radiants!\u201D\r\n\u201CThey didn\u2019t write it. It was their inspiration. Nohadon, an ordinary man, was its author.\u201D\r\nElhokar glanced at him, raising an eyebrow.\r\nSee,it seemed to say.\r\nYou defend it.\u201CYou are growing weak, Uncle. I will not exploit that weakness. But others will.\u201D\r\n\u201CI am\r\nnotgetting weak.\u201D Yet again, Dalinar forced himself to be calm. \u201CThis conversation has gone off the path. The highprinces need a single leader to force them to work together. I vow that if you name me Highprince of War, I\r\nwillsee you protected.\u201D\r\n\u201CAs you saw my father protected?\u201D\r\nDalinar\u2019s mouth snapped shut.\r\nElhokar turned away. \u201CI should not have said that. It was uncalled for.\u201D\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CNo, it was one of the truest things you have said to me, Elhokar. Perhaps you are right to distrust my protection.\u201D\r\nElhokar glanced at him, curious. \u201CWhy do you react that way?\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat way?\u201D\r\n\u201COnce, if someone had said that to you, you\u2019d have summoned your Blade and demanded a duel! Now you agree with them instead.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CMy father started refusing duels, near the end.\u201D Elhokar tapped on the railing. \u201CI see why you feel the need for a Highprince of War, and you may have a point. But the others very much like the present arrangement.\u201D\r\n\u201CBecause it is comfortable to them. If we are going to win, we will\r\nneedto upset them.\u201D Dalinar stepped forward. \u201CElhokar, maybe it\u2019s been long enough. Six years ago, naming a Highprince of War might well have been a mistake. But now? We know one another better, and we\u2019ve been working united against the Parshendi. Perhaps it is time to take the next step.\u201D\r\n\u201CPerhaps,\u201D the king said. \u201CYou think they are ready? I\u2019ll let you prove it to me. If you can show me that they are willing to work with you, Uncle, then I\u2019ll consider naming you Highprince of War. Is that satisfactory?\u201D\r\nIt was a solid compromise. \u201CVery well.\u201D\r\n\u201CGood,\u201D the king said, standing up. \u201CThen let us part for now. It is growing late, and I have yet to hear what Ruthar wishes of me.\u201D\r\nDalinar nodded his farewell, walking back through the king\u2019s chambers, Renarin trailing him.\r\nThe more he considered, the more he felt that this was the right thing to do. Retreating would not work with the Alethi, particularly not with their current mind-set. But if he could shock them out of their complacency, force them to adopt a more aggressive strategy\u2026\r\nHe was still lost in thought considering that as they left the king\u2019s palace and made their way down the ramps to where their horses waited. He climbed astride Gallant, nodding his thanks to the groom who had cared for the Ryshadium. The horse had recovered from his fall during the hunt, his leg solid and hale.\r\nIt was a short distance back to Dalinar\u2019s warcamp, and they rode in silence.\r\nWhich of the highprinces should I approach first?Dalinar thought.\r\nSadeas?\r\nNo. No, he and Sadeas were already seen working together too often. If the other highprinces began to smell a stronger alliance, it would drive them to turn against him. Best that he approach less powerful highprinces first and see if he could get them to work with him in some way. A joint plateau assault, perhaps?\r\nHe\u2019d have to approach Sadeas eventually. He didn\u2019t relish the thought. Things were always so much easier when the two of them could work at a safe distance from one another. He\u2014\r\n\u201CFather,\u201D Renarin said. He sounded dismayed.\r\nDalinar sat upright, looking around, hand going for his side sword even while he prepared to summon his Shardblade. Renarin pointed. Eastward. Stormward.\r\nThe horizon was growing dark.\r\n\u201CWas there supposed to be a highstorm today?\u201D Dalinar asked, alarmed.\r\n\u201CElthebar said it was unlikely,\u201D Renarin said. \u201CBut he\u2019s been wrong before.\u201D\r\nEveryone could be wrong about highstorms. They could be predicted, but it was never an exact science. Dalinar narrowed his eyes, heart thumping. Yes, he could sense the signs now. The dust picking up, the scents changing. It was evening, but there should still be more light left. Instead, it was rapidly growing darker and darker. The very air felt more frantic.\r\n\u201CShould we go to Aladar\u2019s camp?\u201D Renarin said, pointing. They were nearest Highprince Aladar\u2019s warcamp, and perhaps only a quarter-hour ride from the rim of Dalinar\u2019s own.\r\nAladar\u2019s men would take him in. Nobody would forbid shelter to a highprince during a storm. But Dalinar shuddered, thinking of spending a highstorm trapped in an unfamiliar place, surrounded by another highprince\u2019s attendants. They would see him during an episode. Once that happened, the rumors would spread like arrows above a battlefield.\r\n\u201CWe ride!\u201D he called, kicking Gallant into motion. Renarin and the guardsmen fell in behind him, hooves a thunder to precurse the coming highstorm. Dalinar leaned low, tense. The grey sky grew clotted with dust and leaves blown ahead of the stormwall and the air grew dense with humid anticipation. The horizon burgeoned with thickening clouds. Dalinar and the others galloped past Aladar\u2019s perimeter guards, who bustled with activity, holding their coats or cloaks against the wind.\r\n\u201CFather?\u201D Renarin called from behind. \u201CAre you\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CWe have time!\u201D Dalinar shouted.\r\nThey eventually reached the jagged wall of the Kholin warcamp. Here, the remaining soldiers wore blue and white and saluted. Most had already retreated to their enclosures. He had to slow Gallant to get through the checkpoint. However, it would just be another short gallop to his quarters. He turned Gallant, preparing to go.\r\n\u201CFather!\u201D Renarin said, pointing eastward.\r\nThe stormwall hung like a curtain in the air, speeding toward the camp. The massive sheet of rain was a silvery grey, the clouds above onyx black, lit from within by occasional flashes of lightning. The guards who had saluted him were hurrying to a nearby bunker.\r\n\u201CWe can make it,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CWe\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CFather!\u201D Renarin said, riding up beside him and catching his arm. \u201CI\u2019m sorry.\u201D\r\nThe wind whipped at them, and Dalinar gritted his teeth, looking at his son. Renarin\u2019s spectacled eyes were wide with concern.\r\nDalinar glanced at the stormwall again. It was only moments away.\r\nHe\u2019s right.\r\nHe handed Gallant\u2019s reins to an anxious soldier, who took the reins of Renarin\u2019s mount as well, and the two of them dismounted. The groom rushed away, towing the horses into a stone stable. Dalinar almost followed\u2014there would be fewer people to watch him in a stable\u2014but a nearby barrack had the door open, and those inside waved anxiously. That would be safer.\r\nResigned, Dalinar joined Renarin, dashing to the stone-walled barrack. The soldiers made room for them; there was a group of servants packed inside as well. In Dalinar\u2019s camp, no one was forced to weather the tempests in stormtents or flimsy wooden shacks, and nobody had to pay for protection inside stone structures.\r\nThe occupants seemed shocked to see their highprince and his son step in; several paled as the door thumped shut. Their only light was from a few garnets mounted on the walls. Someone coughed, and outside a scattering of windblown rock chips sprayed against the building. Dalinar tried to ignore the uncomfortable eyes around him. Wind howled outside. Perhaps nothing would happen. Perhaps this time\u2014\r\nThe storm hit.\r\nIt began."

      "ChapterName": "19: STARFALLS",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\nHe holds the most frightening and terrible of all of the Shards. Ponder on that for a time, you old reptile, and tell me if your insistence on nonintervention holds firm. Because I assure you, Rayse will not be similarly inhibited.\r\nDalinar blinked. The stuffy, dimly lit barrack was gone. Instead, he stood in darkness. The air was thick with the scent of dried grain, and when he reached out with his left hand, he felt a wooden wall. He was in a barn of some sort.\r\nThe cool night was still and crisp; there was no sign of a storm. He felt carefully at his side. His side sword was gone, as was his uniform. Instead, he wore a homespun belted tunic and a pair of sandals. It was the type of clothing he\u2019d seen depicted on ancient statues.\r\nStormwinds, where have you sent me this time?Each of the visions was different. This would be the twelfth one he\u2019d seen.\r\nOnly twelve?he thought. It seemed like so many more, but this had only begun happening to him a few months ago.\r\nSomething moved in the darkness. He flinched in surprise as something living pressed against him. He nearly struck it, but froze when he heard it whimper. He carefully lowered his arm, feeling the figure\u2019s back. Slight and small\u2014a child. She was quivering.\r\n\u201CFather.\u201D Her voice trembled. \u201CFather, what is happening?\u201D As usual, he was being seen as someone of this place and time. The girl clutched him, obviously terrified. It was too dark to see the fearspren he suspected were climbing up through the ground.\r\nDalinar rested his hand on her back. \u201CHush. It will be all right.\u201D It seemed the right thing to say.\r\n\u201CMother\u2026\u201D\r\n\u201CShe will be fine.\u201D\r\nThe girl huddled more closely against him in the black room. He remained still. Something felt wrong. The building creaked in the wind. It wasn\u2019t well built; the plank beneath Dalinar\u2019s hand was loose, and he was tempted to push it free so he could peek out. But the stillness, the terrified child\u2026There was an oddly putrid scent in the air.\r\nSomething scratched, ever so softly, at the barn\u2019s far wall. Like a fingernail being drawn across a wooden tabletop.\r\nThe girl whimpered, and the scraping sound stopped. Dalinar held his breath, heart beating furiously. Instinctively, he held his hand out to summon his Shardblade, but nothing happened. It would never come during the visions.\r\nThe far wall of the building exploded inward.\r\nSplintered wood flew through the darkness as a large shape burst in. Lit only by moonglow and starlight from outside, the black thing was bigger than an axehound. He couldn\u2019t make out details, but it seemed to have an unnatural wrongness to its form.\r\nThe girl screamed, and Dalinar cursed, grabbing her with one arm and rolling to the side as the black thing leaped for them. It nearly got the child, but Dalinar whipped her out of the creature\u2019s path. Breathless with terror, her scream cut off.\r\nDalinar spun, pushing the girl behind him. His side hit a stack of sacks filled with grain as he edged away. The barn fell silent. Salas\u2019s violet light shone in the sky outside, but the small moon wasn\u2019t bright enough to illuminate the barn\u2019s interior, and the creature had moved into a shadowed recess. He couldn\u2019t see much of it.\r\nIt seemed part of the shadows. Dalinar tensed, fists forward. It made a soft wheezing noise, eerie and faintly reminiscent of rhythmic whispering.\r\nBreathing?Dalinar thought.\r\nNo. It\u2019s sniffing for us.\r\nThe thing darted forward. Dalinar whipped a hand to the side and grabbed one of the grain sacks, pulling it in front of himself. The beast struck the sack, its teeth ripping into it, and Dalinar pulled, tearing the coarse fabric and flinging a fragrant cloud of dusty lavis grain into the air. Then he stepped to the side and kicked the beast as hard as he could.\r\nThe creature felt too soft under his foot, as if he\u2019d kicked a waterskin. The blow knocked it to the ground, and it made a hissing sound. Dalinar flung the bag and its remaining contents upward, filling the air with more dried lavis and dust.\r\nThe beast scrambled to its feet and twisted around, smooth skin reflecting moonlight. It seemed disoriented. Whatever it was, it hunted by smell, and the dust in the air confused it. Dalinar grabbed the girl and threw her over his shoulder, then dashed past the confused creature, barreling through the hole in the broken wall.\r\nHe burst out into violet moonlight. He was in a small lait\u2014a wide rift in the stone with good enough drainage to avoid flooding and a high stone outcropping to break the highstorms. In this case, the eastern rock formation was shaped like an enormous wave, creating shelter for a small village.\r\nThat explained the flimsiness of the barn. Lights flickered here and there across the hollow, indicating a settlement of several dozen homes. He was on the outskirts. There was a hogpen to Dalinar\u2019s right, distant homes to his left, and just ahead\u2014nestled against the rock hill\u2014was a midsized farm house. It was built in an archaic style, with crem bricks for walls.\r\nHis decision was easy. The thing had moved quickly, like a predator. Dalinar wouldn\u2019t outrun it, so he charged toward the farm house. The sound of the beast breaking out through the barn wall came from behind. Dalinar reached the home, but the front door was barred. Dalinar cursed loudly, pounding on it.\r\nClaws scraped on stone from behind as the thing bounded toward them. Dalinar threw his shoulder against the door just as it opened.\r\nHe stumbled inside, dropping the girl to the floor as he found his balance. A middle-aged woman stood inside; violet moonlight revealed that she had thick curly hair and a wide-eyed terrified expression. She slammed the door closed behind him, then barred it.\r\n\u201CPraise the Heralds,\u201D she exclaimed, scooping up the girl. \u201CYou found her, Heb. Bless you.\u201D\r\nDalinar sidled up to the glassless window, looking out. The shutter appeared to be broken loose, making the window impossible to latch closed.\r\nHe couldn\u2019t see the creature. He glanced back over his shoulder. The building\u2019s floor was simple stone and there was no second story. A fireless brick hearth was set on one side, with a rough-cast iron pot hanging above it. It all looked so primitive. What year was this?\r\nIt\u2019s just a vision,he thought.\r\nA waking dream.\r\nWhy did it feel so real, then?\r\nHe looked back out the window. It was silent outside. A twin row of rockbuds grew on the right side of the yard, probably curnips or some other kind of vegetable. Moonlight reflected off the smooth ground. Where was the creature? Had it\u2014\r\nSomething slick-skinned and black leapt up from below and crashed against the window. It shattered the frame, and Dalinar cursed, falling as the thing landed on him. Something sharp slashed his face, cutting open his cheek, spilling blood across his skin.\r\nThe girl screamed again.\r\n\u201CLight!\u201D Dalinar bellowed. \u201CGet me light!\u201D He slammed his fist into the side of the creature\u2019s too-soft head, using his other arm to push back a clawed paw. His cheek burned with pain, and something raked his side, slashing his tunic and cutting his skin.\r\nWith a heave he threw the creature off him. It crashed against the wall, and he rolled to his feet, gasping. As the beast righted itself in the dark room, Dalinar scrambled away, old instincts kicking in, pain evaporating as the battle Thrill surged through him. He needed a weapon! A stool or a table leg. The room was so\u2014\r\nLight flickered on as the woman uncovered a lit pottery lamp. The primitive thing used oil, not Stormlight, but was more than enough to illuminate her terrified face and the girl clinging to her robelike dress. The room had a low table and a pair of stools, but his eyes were drawn to the small hearth.\r\nThere, gleaming like one of the Honorblades of ancient lore, was a simple iron fire poker. It leaned against the stone hearth, tip white with ash. Dalinar lunged forward, snatching it in one hand, twirling it to feel out its balance. He had been trained in classical Windstance, but he fell into Smokestance instead, as it was better with an imperfect weapon. One foot forward, one foot behind, sword\u2014or, in this case, poker\u2014held forward with the tip toward his opponent\u2019s heart.\r\nOnly years of training allowed him to maintain his stance as he saw what he was facing. The creature\u2019s smooth, dark-as-midnight skin reflected light like a pool of tar. It had no visible eyes and its black, knifelike teeth bristled in a head set on a sinuous, boneless neck. The six legs were slender and bent at the sides, appearing far too thin to bear the weight of the fluid, inklike body.\r\nThis isn\u2019t a vision,Dalinar thought.\r\nIt\u2019s a nightmare.\r\nThe creature raised its head, clicking teeth together, and made a hissing sound. Tasting the air.\r\n\u201CSweet wisdom of Battar,\u201D the woman breathed, holding her child close. Her hands shook as she held up the lamp, as if to use it as a weapon.\r\nA scraping came from outside, and was followed by another set of spindly legs slinking over the lip of the broken window. This new beast climbed into the room, joining its companion, which crouched anxiously, sniffing at Dalinar. It seemed wary, as if it could sense that it faced an armed\u2014or at least determined\u2014opponent.\r\nDalinar cursed himself for a fool, raising one hand to his side to stanch the blood. He knew, logically, that he was really back in the barrack with Renarin. This was all happening in his mind; there was no need for him to fight.\r\nBut every instinct, every shred of honor he had, drove him to step to the side, placing himself between the woman and the beasts. Vision, memory, or delusion, he could\r\nnotstand aside.\r\n\u201CHeb,\u201D the woman said, her voice nervous. Who did she see him as? Her husband? A farmhand? \u201CDon\u2019t be a fool! You don\u2019t know how\u2014\u201D\r\nThe beasts attacked. Dalinar leapt forward\u2014remaining in motion was the essence of Smokestance\u2014and spun between the creatures, striking to the side with his poker. He hit the one on the left, ripping a gash in its too-smooth skin.\r\nThe wound bled smoke.\r\nMoving behind the creatures, Dalinar swung again, sweeping low at the feet of the unwounded beast, knocking it off balance. With the follow-through, he slammed the side of the poker into the face of the wounded beast as it turned and snapped at him.\r\nThe old Thrill, the sense of battle, consumed him. It did not enrage him, as it did some men, but everything seemed to become clearer, crisper. His muscles moved easily; he breathed more deeply. He came\r\nalive.\r\nHe leaped backward as the creatures pressed at him. With a kick, he knocked over the table, tumbling it at one of the beasts. He drove the poker at the open maw of the other. As he had hoped, the inside of its mouth was sensitive. The creature let out a pained hiss and scrambled back.\r\nDalinar moved to the overturned table and kicked off one of the legs. He scooped it up, falling into Smokestance\u2019s sword-and-knife form. He used the wooden leg to fend off one creature while he thrust three times at the face of the other, ripping a gash in its cheek that bled smoke; it came out as a hiss.\r\nThere were distant screams outside.\r\nBlood of my fathers,he thought.\r\nThese aren\u2019t the only two.He needed to be done, and quickly. If the fight dragged on, they\u2019d wear him down faster than he wore them down. Who even knew if beasts like this got tired?\r\nBellowing, he jumped forward. Sweat streamed from his forehead, and the room seemed to grow just faintly darker. Or, no, more focused. Just him and the beasts. The only wind was that of his weapons spinning, the only sound that of his feet hitting the floor, the only vibration that of his heart thumping.\r\nHis sudden whirlwind of blows shocked the creatures. He smashed the table leg against one, forcing it back, then threw himself at the other one, earning a rake of the claws against his arm as he rammed the poker into the beast\u2019s chest. The skin resisted at first, but then broke, his poker moving through easily after that.\r\nA powerful jet of smoke burst out around Dalinar\u2019s hand. He pulled his arm free, and the creature stumbled back, legs growing thinner, body deflating like a leaking wineskin.\r\nHe knew he\u2019d exposed himself in attacking. There was nothing to do but throw his arm up as the other beast leapt on him, slashing his forehead and his arm, biting his shoulder. Dalinar screamed, slamming the table leg again and again at the beast\u2019s head. He tried forcing the creature back, but it was terribly strong.\r\nSo Dalinar let himself slip to the ground and kicked upward, tossing the beast over his head. The fangs ripped free of Dalinar\u2019s shoulder with a spray of blood. The beast hit the floor in a mess of black legs.\r\nDizzy, Dalinar forced himself to his feet and fell into his stance.\r\nAlways keep the stance.The creature got to its feet at about the same time, and Dalinar ignored the pain, ignored the blood, letting the Thrill give him focus. He leveled the poker. The table leg had fallen from his blood-slick fingers.\r\nThe beast crouched, then charged. Dalinar let the fluid nature of Smokestance direct him, stepping to the side and smashing the poker into the beast\u2019s legs. It tripped as Dalinar turned around, wielding his poker with both hands and\r\nslammingit directly down into the creature\u2019s back.\r\nThe powerful blow broke the skin, passed through the creature\u2019s body, and hit the stone floor. The creature struggled, legs working ineffectively, as smoke hissed out the holes in its back and stomach. Dalinar stepped away, wiping blood from his forehead, leaving the weapon to fall to the side and clang to the ground, still impaling the beast.\r\n\u201C\r\nThree Gods, Heb,\u201D the woman whispered.\r\nHe turned to find her looking completely shocked as she stared at the deflating carcasses. \u201CI should have helped,\u201D she mumbled, \u201Cshould have grabbed something to hit them. But you were so fast. It\u2014it was just a few heartbeats. Where\u2014How\u2014?\u201D She focused on him. \u201CI\u2019ve never seen anything like it, Heb. You fought like a\u2026like one of the Radiants themselves. Where did you learn that?\u201D\r\nDalinar didn\u2019t answer. He pulled off his shirt, grimacing as the pain of his wounds returned. Only the shoulder was immediately dangerous, but it was bad; his left arm was growing numb. He ripped the shirt in half, tying one portion around his gashed right forearm, then wadded the rest and pressed it against his shoulder. He walked over and pulled the poker free of the deflated body, which now resembled a black silk sack. Then he moved to the window. The other homes showed signs of being attacked, fires burning, faint screams hanging on the wind.\r\n\u201CWe need to get someplace safe,\u201D he said. \u201CIs there a cellar nearby?\u201D\r\n\u201CA what?\u201D\r\n\u201CCave in the rock, man-made or natural.\u201D\r\n\u201CNo caves,\u201D the woman said, joining him at the window. \u201CHow would men make a hole in the\r\nrock?\u201D\r\nWith a Shardblade or a Soulcaster. Or even with basic mining\u2014though that could be difficult, as the crem would seal up caverns and highstorm rains made for an extremely potent risk of flooding. Dalinar looked out the window again. Dark shapes moved in the moonlight; some were coming in their direction.\r\nHe wavered, dizzy. Blood loss. Gritting his teeth, he steadied himself against the frame of the window. How long was this vision going to last? \u201CWe need a river. Something to wash away the trail of our scent. Is there one nearby?\u201D\r\nThe woman nodded, growing pale faced as she noticed the dark forms in the night.\r\n\u201CGet the girl, woman.\u201D\r\n\u201C\u2018The girl\u2019? Seeli, our\r\ndaughter. And since when have you called me woman? Is Taffa so hard to say? Stormwinds, Heb, what has gotten into you?\u201D\r\nHe shook his head, moving to the door and throwing it open, still carrying the poker. \u201CBring the lamp. The light won\u2019t give us away; I don\u2019t think they can see.\u201D\r\nThe woman obeyed, hurrying to collect Seeli\u2014she looked to be about six or seven\u2014then followed Dalinar out, the clay lamp\u2019s fragile flame quivering in the night. It looked a little like a slipper.\r\n\u201CThe river?\u201D Dalinar asked.\r\n\u201CYou know where\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CI hit my head, Taffa,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CI\u2019m dizzy. It\u2019s hard to think.\u201D\r\nThe woman looked worried at that, but seemed to accept this answer. She pointed away from the village.\r\n\u201CLet\u2019s go,\u201D he said, moving out into the darkness. \u201CAre attacks by these beasts common?\u201D\r\n\u201CDuring Desolations, perhaps, but not in my life! Stormwinds, Heb. We need to get you to\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D he said. \u201CWe keep moving.\u201D\r\nThey continued along a path, which ran up toward the back side of the\u00A0wave formation. Dalinar kept glancing back at the village. How many people were dying below, murdered by those beasts from Damnation? Where were the landlord\u2019s soldiers?\r\nPerhaps this village was too remote, too far from a citylord\u2019s direct protection. Or perhaps things didn\u2019t work that way in this era, this place.\r\nI\u2019ll see the woman and child to the river, then I\u2019ll return to organize a resistance. If anyone is left.\r\nThe thought seemed laughable. He had to use the poker to keep himself upright. How was\r\nhegoing to organize a resistance?\r\nHe slipped on a steep portion of the trail, and Taffa set down the lamp, grabbing his arm, concerned. The landscape was rough with boulders and rockbuds, their vines and leaves extended in the cool, wet night. Those rustled in the wind. Dalinar righted himself, then nodded to the woman, gesturing for her to continue.\r\nA faint scraping sounded in the night; Dalinar turned, tense.\r\n\u201CHeb?\u201D the woman asked, sounding afraid.\r\n\u201CHold up the light.\u201D\r\nShe raised the lamp, illuminating the hillside in flickering yellow. A good dozen midnight patches, skins too smooth, were creeping over rockbuds and boulders. Even their teeth and claws were black.\r\nSeeli whimpered, pulling close to her mother.\r\n\u201CRun,\u201D Dalinar said softly, raising his poker.\r\n\u201CHeb, they\u2019re\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CRun!\u201D he bellowed.\r\n\u201CThey\u2019re in front of us too!\u201D\r\nHe spun, picking out the dark patches ahead. He cursed, looking around. \u201CThere,\u201D he said, pointing to a nearby rock formation. It was tall and flat. He shoved Taffa forward, and she towed Seeli, their single-piece, blue dresses rippling in the wind.\r\nThey ran more quickly than he could in his state, and Taffa reached the rock wall first. She looked up, as if to climb to the top. It was too steep for that; Dalinar just wanted something solid to put at his back. He stepped onto a flat, open section of rock before the formation and raised his weapon. Black beasts crawled carefully over the stones. Could he distract them, somehow, and let the other two flee? He felt so dizzy.\r\nWhat I\u2019d give for my Shardplate\u2026\r\nSeeli whimpered. Her mother tried to comfort her, but the woman\u2019s voice was unnerved. She knew. Knew those bundles of blackness, like living night, would rip them and tear them. What was that word she\u2019d used? Desolation. The book spoke of them. The Desolations had happened during the near-mythical shadowdays, before real history began. Before mankind had defeated the Voidbringers and taken the war to heaven.\r\nThe Voidbringers. Was that what these things were? Myths. Myths come to life to kill him.\r\nSeveral of the creatures lunged forward, and he felt the Thrill surge within him again, strengthening him as he swung. They jumped back, cautious, testing for weakness. Others sniffed the air, pacing. They wanted to get at the woman and child.\r\nDalinar jumped at them, forcing them away, uncertain where he found the strength. One got close, and he swung at it, falling into Windstance, as it was most familiar. The sweeping strikes, the grace.\r\nHe struck at the beast, scoring it on its flank, but two others jumped at him from the side. Claws raked his back, and the weight threw him to the stones. He cursed, rolling, punching a creature and tossing it back. Another bit his wrist, causing him to drop the poker in a flash of pain. He bellowed and slammed his fist into the creature\u2019s jaw and it opened reflexively, freeing his hand.\r\nThe monsters pressed forward. Somehow he got to his feet and stumbled back against the rock wall. The woman threw the lamp at a creature that got too close, spraying oil across the stones and setting it alight. The fire didn\u2019t seem to bother the creatures.\r\nThe move exposed Seeli, as Taffa fell off balance in the throw. A monster knocked her down, and others scrambled for the child\u2014but Dalinar leaped for her, wrapping his arms around her, huddling down and turning his back on the monsters. One leaped on his back. Claws sliced his skin.\r\nSeeli whimpered in terror. Taffa was screaming as the monsters overwhelmed her.\r\n\u201CWhy are you showing me this!\u201D Dalinar bellowed into the night. \u201CWhy must I live\r\nthisvision? Curse you!\u201D Claws raked his back; he clutched Seeli, back arching in pain. He cast his eyes upward, toward the sky.\r\nAnd there, he saw a brilliant blue light falling through the air.\r\nIt was like a star rock, dropping at an incredible speed. Dalinar cried out as the light hit the ground a short distance away, cracking the stone, spraying rock chips in the air. The ground shook. The beasts froze.\r\nDalinar turned numbly to the side, then he watched in amazement as the light stood up, limbs unfolding. It wasn\u2019t a star at all. It was a man\u2014a man in glowing blue Shardplate, bearing a Shardblade, trails of Stormlight rising from his body.\r\nThe creatures hissed furiously, suddenly throwing themselves at the figure, ignoring Dalinar and the other two. The Shardbearer raised his Blade and struck forward with skill, stepping into the attacks.\r\nDalinar lay stunned. This was unlike any Shardbearer he had ever seen. The Plate glowed with an even blue light, and glyphs\u2014some familiar, others not\u2014were etched into the metal. They trailed blue vapor.\r\nMoving fluidly, Plate clinking, the man struck at the beasts. He effortlessly sheared a monster in half, flinging pieces into the night that trailed black smoke.\r\nDalinar pulled himself to Taffa. She was alive, though her side was torn and flayed. Seeli tugged at her, weeping.\r\nNeed to\u2026do something\u2026Dalinar thought dully.\r\n\u201CBe at peace,\u201D a voice said.\r\nDalinar lurched, turning to see a woman in delicate Shardplate kneeling beside him, holding something bright. It was a topaz entwined with a heliodor, both set into a fine metal framework, each stone as big as a man\u2019s hand. The woman had light tan eyes that almost seemed to glow in the night, and she wore no helm. Her hair was pulled back into a bun. She raised a hand and touched his forehead.\r\nIce washed across him. Suddenly, his pain was gone.\r\nThe woman reached out and touched Taffa. The flesh on her arm regrew in an eyeblink; the torn muscle remained where it was, but other flesh just\r\ngrewwhere the chunks had been torn out. The skin knitted up over it without flaw, and the female Shardbearer wiped away the blood and torn flesh with a white cloth.\r\nTaffa looked up, awed. \u201CYou came,\u201D she whispered. \u201CBless the Almighty.\u201D\r\nThe female Shardbearer stood; her armor glowed with an even amber light. She smiled and turned to the side, a Shardblade forming from mist into her hand as she rushed to aid her companion.\r\nA woman Shardbearer,Dalinar thought. He\u2019d never seen such a thing.\r\nHe stood up, hesitant. He felt strong and healthy, as if he\u2019d just awakened from a good night\u2019s sleep. He glanced down at his arm, pulling off his makeshift bandage. He had to wipe free blood and some torn skin, but underneath, the skin was perfectly healed. He took a few deep breaths. Then shrugged, picked up his poker, and joined the fight.\r\n\u201CHeb?\u201D Taffa called from behind. \u201CAre you insane?\u201D\r\nHe didn\u2019t respond. He couldn\u2019t very well just sit there while two strangers fought to protect him. There were dozens of the black creatures. As he watched, one landed a scraping hit on the Shardbearer in blue, and the claw scored the Shardplate, digging into and cracking it. The danger to these Shardbearers was real.\r\nThe female Shardbearer turned to Dalinar. She had her helm on now. When had she put it on? She seemed shocked as Dalinar threw himself at one of the black beasts, slashing it with his poker. He fell into Smokestance and fended against its counterattack. The female Shardbearer turned to her companion, then the two of them fell into stances forming a triangle with Dalinar, his position closest to the rock formation.\r\nWith two Shardbearers alongside him, the fighting went remarkably better than it had back at the house. He only managed to dispatch a single beast\u2014they were quick and strong, and he fought defensively, trying to distract and keep pressure off the Shardbearers. The creatures did not retreat. They continued to attack until the last one was sliced in two by the female Shardbearer.\r\nDalinar stopped, puffing, lowering his poker. Other lights had fallen\u2014and still were falling\u2014from the sky in the direction of the village; presumably, some of these strange Shardbearers had landed there as well.\r\n\u201CWell,\u201D a strong voice said, \u201CI must say that I\u2019ve never before had the pleasure of fighting alongside a comrade with such\u2026unconventional means.\u201D\r\nDalinar turned to find the male Shardbearer regarding him. Where had the man\u2019s helm gone? The Shardbearer stood with his Blade resting on his armored shoulder, and he inspected Dalinar with eyes of such bright blue, they were almost white. Were those eyes actually\r\nglowing, leaking Stormlight? His skin was dark brown, like a Makabaki, and he had short black curly hair. His armor no longer glowed, though one large symbol\u2014emblazoned across the front of the breastplate\u2014still gave off a faint blue light.\r\nDalinar recognized the symbol, the particular pattern of the stylized double eye, eight spheres connected with two at the center. It had been the symbol of the Lost Radiants, back when they\u2019d been called the Knights Radiant.\r\nThe female Shardbearer watched the village.\r\n\u201CWho trained you in the sword?\u201D the male knight asked Dalinar.\r\nDalinar met the eyes of the knight. He had no idea how to respond.\r\n\u201CThis is my husband Heb, good knight,\u201D Taffa said, rushing forward, leading her daughter by the hand. \u201CHe\u2019s never seen a sword, far as I know.\u201D\r\n\u201CYour stances are unfamiliar to me,\u201D the knight said. \u201CBut they were practiced and precise. This level of skill comes only with years of training. I have rarely seen a man\u2014knight or soldier\u2014fight as well as you did.\u201D\r\nDalinar remained silent.\r\n\u201CNo words for me, I see,\u201D the knight said. \u201CVery well. But should you wish to put that mysterious training of yours to use, come to Urithiru.\u201D\r\n\u201CUrithiru?\u201D Dalinar said. He\u2019d heard that name somewhere.\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D the knight said. \u201CI cannot promise you a position in one of the orders\u2014that decision is not mine\u2014but if your skill with the sword is similar to your skill with hearth-tending implements, then I am confident you will find a place with us.\u201D He turned eastward, toward the village. \u201CSpread the word. Signs like this one are not without import. A Desolation is coming.\u201D He turned to his companion. \u201CI will go. Guard these three and lead them to the village. We cannot leave them alone in the dangers of this night.\u201D\r\nHis companion nodded. The blue knight\u2019s armor began to glow faintly, then he launched into the air, as if falling straight up. Dalinar stumbled back, shocked, watching the glowing blue figure rise, then arc downward toward the village.\r\n\u201CCome,\u201D the woman said, voice ringing inside her helm. She began to hurry down the incline.\r\n\u201CWait,\u201D Dalinar said, hastening after her, Taffa scooping up her daughter and following. Behind them, the oil was burning out.\r\nThe female knight slowed to allow Dalinar and Taffa to keep pace with her.\r\n\u201CI must know,\u201D Dalinar said, feeling foolish. \u201CWhat year is it?\u201D\r\nThe knight turned to him. Her helm was gone. He blinked; when had that happened? Unlike her companion, she had light skin\u2014not pale like someone from Shinovar, but a natural light tan, like an Alethi. \u201CIt is Eighth Epoch, three thirty-seven.\u201D\r\nEighth Epoch?Dalinar thought.\r\nWhat does that mean?This vision had been different from the others. They had been more brief, for one thing. And the voice that spoke to him. Where was it?\r\n\u201CWhere am I?\u201D Dalinar asked the knight. \u201CWhat kingdom?\u201D\r\nThe knight frowned. \u201CAre you not healed?\u201D\r\n\u201CI am well. I just\u2026I need to know. Which kingdom am I in?\u201D\r\n\u201CThis is Natanatan.\u201D\r\nDalinar released an inhaled breath.\r\nNatanatan.The Shattered Plains lay in the land that had once been Natanatan. The kingdom had fallen centuries ago.\r\n\u201CAnd you fight for Natanatan\u2019s king?\u201D he asked.\r\nShe laughed. \u201CThe Knights Radiant fight for no king and for all of them.\u201D\r\n\u201CThen where do you live?\u201D\r\n\u201CUrithiru is where our orders are centered, but we live in cities all across Alethela.\u201D\r\nDalinar froze in place. Alethela. It was the historical name for the place that had become Alethkar. \u201CYou cross kingdom borders to fight?\u201D\r\n\u201CHeb,\u201D Taffa said. She seemed very concerned. \u201CYou were the one who promised me that the Radiants would come protect us, just before you went out searching for Seeli. Is your mind still muddled? Lady knight, could you heal him again?\u201D\r\n\u201CI should save Regrowth for others who might be wounded,\u201D the woman said, glancing at the village. The fighting seemed to be dying down.\r\n\u201CI\u2019m fine,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CAlethk\u2026Alethela. You live there?\u201D\r\n\u201CIt is our duty and our privilege,\u201D the woman said, \u201Cto stay vigilant for the Desolation. One kingdom to study the arts of war so that the others might have peace. We die so that you may live. It has ever been our place.\u201D\r\nDalinar stood still, sorting through that.\r\n\u201CAll who can fight are needed,\u201D the woman said. \u201CAnd all who have a\r\ndesireto fight should be compelled to come to Alethela. Fighting, even this fighting against the Ten Deaths, changes a person. We can teach you so that it will not destroy you. Come to us.\u201D\r\nDalinar found himself nodding.\r\n\u201CEvery pasture needs three things,\u201D the woman said, voice changing, as if she were quoting from memory. \u201CFlocks to grow, herdsmen to tend, and watchers at the rim. We of Alethela are those watchers\u2014the warriors who protect and fight. We maintain the terrible arts of killing, then pass them on to others when the Desolation comes.\u201D\r\n\u201CThe Desolation,\u201D he said. \u201CThat means the Voidbringers, right? Those are what we fought this night?\u201D\r\nThe knight sniffed dismissively. \u201CVoidbringers? These? No, this was Midnight Essence, though who released it is still a mystery.\u201D She looked to the side, expression growing distant. \u201CHarkaylain says the Desolation is close, and he is not often wrong. He\u2014\u201D\r\nA sudden screaming sounded in the night. The knight cursed, looking toward it. \u201CWait here. Call out if the Essence returns. I will hear.\u201D She dashed off into the darkness.\r\nDalinar raised a hand, torn between following and staying to watch over Taffa and her daughter.\r\nStormfather!he thought, realizing they\u2019d been left in darkness, now that the knight\u2019s glowing armor was gone.\r\nHe turned back to Taffa. She stood on the trail beside him, eyes looking oddly distracted.\r\n\u201CTaffa?\u201D he asked.\r\n\u201CI miss these times,\u201D Taffa said.\r\nDalinar jumped. That voice wasn\u2019t hers. It was a man\u2019s voice, deep and powerful. It was the voice that spoke to him during every vision.\r\n\u201CWho are you?\u201D Dalinar asked.\r\n\u201CThey were one, once,\u201D Taffa\u2014or whatever it was\u2014said. \u201CThe orders. Men. Not without problems or strife, of course. But focused.\u201D\r\nDalinar felt a chill. Something about that voice always seemed faintly familiar to him. It had even in the first vision. \u201CPlease. You have to tell me what this is, why you are showing me these things. Who are you? Some servant of the Almighty?\u201D\r\n\u201CI wish I could help you,\u201D Taffa said, looking at Dalinar but ignoring his questions. \u201CYou have to unite them.\u201D\r\n\u201CAs you\u2019ve said before! But I need help. The things the knight said about Alethkar. Are they true? Can we really be that way again?\u201D\r\n\u201CTo speak of what might be is forbidden,\u201D the voice said. \u201CTo speak of what was depends on perspective. But I will try to help.\u201D\r\n\u201CThen give me more than vague answers!\u201D\r\nTaffa regarded him, somber. Somehow, by starlight alone, he could make out her brown eyes. There was something deep, something daunting, hiding behind them.\r\n\u201CAt least tell me this,\u201D Dalinar said, grasping for a specific question to ask. \u201CI have trusted Highprince Sadeas, but my son\u2014Adolin\u2014thinks I am a fool to do so. Should I continue to trust Sadeas?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D the being said. \u201CThis is important. Do not let strife consume you. Be strong. Act with honor, and honor will aid you.\u201D\r\nFinally, Dalinar thought.\r\nSomething concrete.\r\nHe heard voices. The dark landscape around Dalinar grew vague. \u201CNo!\u201D He reached for the woman. \u201CDon\u2019t send me back yet. What should I do about Elhokar, and the war?\u201D\r\n\u201CI will give you what I can.\u201D The voice was growing indistinct. \u201CI am sorry for not giving more.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat kind of answer is that?\u201D Dalinar bellowed. He shook himself, struggling. Hands held him. Where had they come from? He cursed, batting them away, twisting, trying to break free.\r\nThen he froze. He was in the barrack at the Shattered Plains, soft rain rattling on the roof. The bulk of the storm had passed. A group of soldiers held Dalinar down while Renarin watched with concern.\r\nDalinar grew still, mouth open. He had been yelling. The soldiers looked uncomfortable, glancing at each other, not meeting his gaze. If it was like before, he\u2019d have acted out his role in the vision, speaking in gibberish, flailing around.\r\n\u201CMy mind is clear now,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CIt\u2019s all right. You can all let me go.\u201D\r\nRenarin nodded to the others, and they hesitantly released him. Renarin tried to make some stuttering excuses, telling them that his father was simply eager for combat. It didn\u2019t sound very convincing.\r\nDalinar retreated to the back of the barrack, sitting down on the floor between two rolled up bedrolls, just breathing in and out and thinking. He trusted the visions, yet his life in the warcamps had been difficult enough lately without people presuming him mad.\r\nAct with honor, and honor will aid you.\r\nThe vision had told him to trust Sadeas. But he\u2019d never be able to explain that to Adolin\u2014who not only hated Sadeas, but thought the visions were delusions from Dalinar\u2019s mind. The only thing to do was keep going as he had.\r\nAnd find a way, somehow, to get the highprinces to work together."

      "ChapterName": "20: SCARLET",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\nSEVEN YEARS AGO\r\n\u201CI can save her,\u201D Kal said, pulling off his shirt.\r\nThe child was only five. She\u2019d fallen far.\r\n\u201CI can save her.\u201D He was mumbling. A crowd had gathered. It had been two months since Brightlord Wistiow\u2019s death; they still didn\u2019t have a replacement citylord. He had barely seen Laral at all in that time.\r\nKal was only thirteen, but he\u2019d been trained well. The first danger was blood loss; the child\u2019s leg had broken, a compound fracture, and it was spurting red where bone had split the skin. Kal found his hands trembling as he pressed his fingers against the wound. The broken bone was slick, even the jagged end, wetted by blood. Which arteries had been torn?\r\n\u201CWhat are you doing to my daughter?\u201D Thick-shouldered Harl pushed through the onlookers. \u201CYou cremling, you storm\u2019s leavings! Don\u2019t touch Miasal! Don\u2019t\u2014\u201D\r\nHarl broke off as several of the other men pulled him back. They knew that Kal\u2014who had been passing by chance\u2014was the girl\u2019s best hope. Alim had already been sent to fetch Kal\u2019s father.\r\n\u201CI can save her,\u201D Kal said. Her face was pale, and she didn\u2019t move. That head wound, maybe it\u2026\r\nCan\u2019t think about that. One of the lower leg arteries was severed. He used his shirt to tie a tourniquet to stop the blood, but it kept slipping. Fingers still pressed against the cut, he called, \u201CFire! I need fire! Hurry! And someone give me your shirt!\u201D\r\nSeveral men rushed off as Kal elevated the leg. One of the men hurriedly handed over his shirt. Kal knew where to pinch to cut off the artery; the tourniquet slipped, but his fingers did not. He held that artery closed, pressing the shirt on the rest of the wound until Valama came back with a candle\u2019s flame.\r\nThey\u2019d already begun heating a knife. Good. Kal took the knife, burning it into the wound, releasing the sharply pungent smell of scorched flesh. A cool wind blew across them, carrying it away.\r\nKal\u2019s hands stopped shaking. He\r\nknewwhat to do. He moved with skill that surprised even him, perfectly cauterizing, as his training took control. He still needed to tie off the artery\u2014a cauterization might not hold on an artery this large\u2014but the two together should work.\r\nWhen he was done, the bleeding had stopped. He sat back, smiling. And then he noticed that Miasal\u2019s head wound wasn\u2019t bleeding either. Her chest wasn\u2019t moving.\r\n\u201CNo!\u201D Harl fell to his knees. \u201CNo! Do something!\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2026\u201D Kal said. He\u2019d stopped the bleeding. He\u2019d\u2026\r\nHe\u2019d lost her.\r\nHe didn\u2019t know what to say, how to respond. A deep, terrible, sickness washed over him. Harl shoved him aside, wailing, Kal fell backward. He found himself shaking again as Harl clutched the corpse.\r\nAround them, the crowd was silent.\r\nAn hour later, Kal sat on the steps in front of the surgery room, crying. It was a soft thing, his grief. A shake here. A few persistent tears, slipping down his cheeks.\r\nHe sat with knees up, arms wrapped around his legs, trying to figure out how to stop hurting. Was there a salve to take away this pain? A bandage to stop the flow from his eyes? He should have been able to\r\nsaveher.\r\nFootsteps approached, and a shadow fell on him. Lirin knelt down beside him. \u201CI inspected your work, son. You did well. I\u2019m proud.\u201D\r\n\u201CI failed,\u201D Kal whispered. His clothing was stained red. Before he\u2019d washed the blood free of his hands, it had been scarlet. But soaked into his clothing, it was a duller reddish brown.\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve known men who practiced for hours and hours, yet still froze when confronted by a wounded person. It\u2019s harder when it takes you by surprise.\r\nYoudidn\u2019t freeze, you went to her, administered help. And you did it well.\u201D\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t want to be a surgeon,\u201D Kal said. \u201CI\u2019m terrible at it.\u201D\r\nLirin sighed, rounding the steps, sitting down beside his son. \u201CKal, this happens. It\u2019s unfortunate, but you couldn\u2019t have done more. That little body lost blood too quickly.\u201D\r\nKal didn\u2019t reply.\r\n\u201CYou have to learn when to care, son,\u201D Lirin said softly. \u201CAnd when to let go. You\u2019ll see. I had similar problems when I was younger. You\u2019ll grow calluses.\u201D\r\nAnd this is a good thing?Kal thought, another tear trickling down his cheek.\r\nYou have to learn when to care\u2026and when to let go\u2026.\r\nIn the distance, Harl continued to wail."

      "ChapterName": "21: WHY MEN LIE",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\nOne need only look at the aftermath of his brief visit to Sel to see proof of what I say.\r\nKaladin didn\u2019t want to open his eyes. If he opened his eyes, he\u2019d be awake. And if he were awake, that pain\u2014the burning in his side, the aching of his legs, the dull throb in his arms and shoulders\u2014wouldn\u2019t be just a nightmare. It would be real. And it would be his.\r\nHe stifled a groan, rolling onto his side. It all ached. Every length of muscle, every inch of skin. His head pounded. It seemed that his very\r\nboneswere sore. He wanted to lie motionless and throbbing until Gaz was forced to come and tow him out by his ankles. That would be easy. Didn\u2019t he deserve to do what was easy, for once?\r\nBut he couldn\u2019t. To stop moving, to give up, would be the same as dying, and he could not let that happen. He\u2019d made his decision already. He would help the bridgemen.\r\nCurse you, Hav,he thought.\r\nYou can boot me out of my bunk even now. Kaladin threw off his blanket, forcing himself to stand. The door to the barrack was cracked open to let in fresh air.\r\nHe felt worse standing up, but the life of a bridgeman wouldn\u2019t wait for him to recover. You either kept up or you got crushed. Kaladin steadied himself, hand against the unnaturally smooth, Soulcast rock of the barrack wall. Then he took a deep breath and crossed the room. Oddly, more than a few of the men were awake and sitting up. They watched Kaladin in silence.\r\nThey were waiting,Kaladin realized.\r\nThey wanted to see if I\u2019d get up.\r\nHe found the three wounded where he\u2019d left them at the front of the barrack. He held his breath as he checked on Leyten. Amazingly, he was still alive. His breathing was still shallow, his pulse weak and his wounds dire, but he was alive.\r\nHe wouldn\u2019t stay that way long without antiseptic. None of the wounds looked infected with rotspren yet, but it would only be a matter of time in these dirty confines. He needed some of the apothecary\u2019s salves. But how?\r\nHe checked the other two. Hobber was smiling openly. He was round-faced and lean, with a gap between his teeth and short, black hair. \u201CThank you,\u201D he said. \u201CThank you for saving me.\u201D\r\nKaladin grunted, inspecting the man\u2019s leg. \u201CYou\u2019ll be fine, but you won\u2019t be able to walk for a few weeks. I\u2019ll bring food from the mess hall for you.\u201D\r\n\u201CThank you,\u201D Hobber whispered, taking Kaladin\u2019s hand, clutching it. He actually seemed to be tearing up.\r\nThat smile forced back the gloom, made the aches and soreness fade. Kaladin\u2019s father had described that kind of smile. Those smiles weren\u2019t why Lirin had become a surgeon, but they\r\nwerewhy he\u2019d remained one.\r\n\u201CRest,\u201D Kaladin said, \u201Cand keep that wound clean. We don\u2019t want to attract any rotspren. Let me know if you see any. They are small and red, like tiny insects.\u201D\r\nHobber nodded eagerly and Kaladin moved to Dabbid. The youthful bridgeman looked just as he had the day before, staring forward, eyes unfocused.\r\n\u201CHe was sitting like that when I fell asleep too, sir,\u201D Hobber said. \u201CIt\u2019s like he hasn\u2019t moved all night. Gives me the chills, it does.\u201D\r\nKaladin snapped his fingers in front of Dabbid\u2019s eyes. The man jumped at the sound, focusing on the fingers, following them as Kaladin moved his hand.\r\n\u201CHe\u2019s been hit in the head, I think,\u201D Hobber said.\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CIt\u2019s battle shock. It will wear off.\u201D\r\nI hope.\r\n\u201CIf you say so, sir,\u201D Hobber said, scratching at the side of his head.\r\nKaladin stood and pushed the door open all the way, lighting the room. It was a clear day, the sun just barely over the horizon. Already, sounds drifted from the warcamp, a blacksmith working early, hammer on metal. Chulls trumpeting in the stables. The air was cool, chilly, clinging to the vestiges of night. It smelled clean and fresh. Spring weather.\r\nYou got up,Kaladin told himself.\r\nMight as well get on with it.He forced himself to go out and do his stretches, body complaining at each motion. Then he checked his own wound. It wasn\u2019t too bad, though infection could make it worse.\r\nStormwinds take that apothecary!he thought, fetching a ladle full of water from the bridgeman barrel, using it to wash his wound.\r\nHe immediately regretted the bitter thought against the elderly apothecary. What was the man to do? Give Kaladin the antiseptic for free? It was Highprince Sadeas he should be cursing. Sadeas was responsible for the wound, and was also the one who had forbidden the surgeon\u2019s hall to give supplies to bridgemen, slaves, and servants of the lesser nahns.\r\nBy the time he finished stretching, a handful of bridgemen had risen to get something to drink. They stood around the barrel, regarding Kaladin.\r\nThere was only one thing to do. Setting his jaw, Kaladin crossed the lumber grounds and located the plank he\u2019d carried the day before. The carpenters hadn\u2019t yet added it to their bridge, so Kaladin picked it up and walked back to the barracks. Then he began practicing the same way he had yesterday.\r\nHe couldn\u2019t go as fast. In fact, much of the time, he could only walk. But as he worked, his aches soothed. His headache faded. His feet and shoulders still hurt, and he had a deep, latent exhaustion. But he didn\u2019t embarrass himself by falling over.\r\nIn his practice, he passed the other bridgeman barracks. The men in front of them were barely distinguishable from those in Bridge Four. The\u00A0same dark, sweat-stained leather vests over bare chests or loosely tied shirts. There was the occasional foreigner, Thaylens or Vedens most often. But they were unified in their scraggly appearances, unshaven faces, and haunted eyes. Several groups watched Kaladin with outright hostility. Were they worried that his practice would encourage their own bridgeleaders to work them?\r\nHe had hoped that some members of Bridge Four might join his work-out. They\u2019d obeyed him during the battle, after all, even going so far as to help him with the wounded. His hope was in vain. While some bridgemen watched, others ignored him. None took part.\r\nEventually, Syl flitted down and landed on the end of his plank, riding like a queen on her palanquin. \u201CThey\u2019re talking about you,\u201D she said as he passed the Bridge Four barrack again.\r\n\u201CNot surprising,\u201D Kaladin said between puffs.\r\n\u201CSome think you\u2019ve gone mad,\u201D she said. \u201CLike that man who just sits and stares at the floor. They say the battle stress broke your mind.\u201D\r\n\u201CMaybe they\u2019re right. I didn\u2019t consider that.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat\r\nismadness?\u201D she asked, sitting with one leg up against her chest, vaporous skirt flickering around her calves and vanishing into mist.\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s when men don\u2019t think right,\u201D Kaladin said, glad for the conversation to distract him.\r\n\u201CMen\r\nneverseem to think right.\u201D\r\n\u201CMadness is worse than normal,\u201D Kaladin said with a smile. \u201CIt really just depends on the people around you. How different are you from them? The person that stands out is mad, I guess.\u201D\r\n\u201CSo you all just\u2026vote on it?\u201D she asked, screwing up her face.\r\n\u201CWell, not so actively. But it\u2019s the right idea.\u201D\r\nShe sat thoughtfully for a time longer. \u201CKaladin,\u201D she finally said. \u201CWhy do men lie? I can see what lies are, but I don\u2019t know\r\nwhypeople do it.\u201D\r\n\u201CLots of reasons,\u201D Kaladin said, wiping the sweat from his brow with his free hand, then using it to steady the plank.\r\n\u201CIs it madness?\u201D\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know if I\u2019d say that. Everyone does it.\u201D\r\n\u201CSo maybe you\u2019re all a little mad.\u201D\r\nHe chuckled. \u201CYes, perhaps.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut if everyone does it,\u201D she said, leaning her head on her knee, \u201Cthen the one who\r\ndoesn\u2019twould be the one who is mad, right? Isn\u2019t that what you said earlier?\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, I guess. But I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a person out there who hasn\u2019t ever lied.\u201D\r\n\u201CDalinar.\u201D\r\n\u201CWho?\u201D\r\n\u201CThe king\u2019s uncle,\u201D Syl said. \u201CEveryone says he never lies. Your bridgemen even talk about it sometimes.\u201D\r\nThat\u2019s right. The Blackthorn. Kaladin had heard of him, even in his youth. \u201CHe\u2019s a lighteyes. That means he lies.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CThey\u2019re all the same, Syl. The more noble they look, the more corrupt they are inside. It\u2019s all an act.\u201D He fell quiet, surprised at the vehemence of his bitterness.\r\nStorm you, Amaram. You did this to me.He\u2019d been burned too often to trust the flame.\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t think men were always this way,\u201D she said absently, getting a far-off look in her face. \u201CI\u2026\u201D\r\nKaladin waited for her to continue, but she didn\u2019t. He passed Bridge Four again; many of the men relaxed, backs to the barrack wall, waiting for the afternoon shade to cover them. They rarely waited inside. Perhaps staying inside all day was too gloomy, even for bridgemen.\r\n\u201CSyl?\u201D he finally prompted. \u201CWere you going to say something?\u201D\r\n\u201CIt seems I\u2019ve heard men talk about times when there were no lies.\u201D\r\n\u201CThere are stories,\u201D Kaladin said, \u201Cabout the times of the Heraldic Epochs, when men were bound by honor. But you\u2019ll always find people telling stories about supposedly better days. You watch. A man joins a new team of soldiers, and the first thing he\u2019ll do is talk about how wonderful his old team was. We remember the good times and the bad ones, forgetting that most times are neither good nor bad. They just are.\u201D\r\nHe broke into a jog. The sun was growing warm overhead, but he wanted to move.\r\n\u201CThe stories,\u201D he continued between puffs, \u201Cthey prove it. What happened to the Heralds? They abandoned us. What happened to the Knights Radiant? They fell and became tarnished. What happened to the Epoch Kingdoms? They crashed when the church tried to seize power. You can\u2019t trust anyone with power, Syl.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat do you do, then? Have no leaders?\u201D\r\n\u201CNo. You give the power to the lighteyes and leave it to corrupt them. Then try to stay as far from them as possible.\u201D His words felt hollow. How good a job had\r\nhedone staying away from lighteyes? He always seemed to be in the thick of them, caught in the muddy mire they created with their plots, schemes, and greed.\r\nSyl fell silent, and after that last jog, he decided to stop his practicing. He couldn\u2019t afford to strain himself again. He returned the plank. The carpenters scratched their heads, but didn\u2019t complain. He made his way back to the bridgemen, noticing that a small group of them\u2014including Rock and Teft\u2014were chatting and glancing at Kaladin.\r\n\u201CYou know,\u201D Kaladin said to Syl, \u201Ctalking to you probably doesn\u2019t do anything for my reputation of being insane.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll do my best to stop being so interesting,\u201D Syl said, alighting on his shoulder. She put her hands on her hips, then plopped down to a sitting position, smiling, obviously pleased with her comment.\r\nBefore Kaladin could get back to the barrack, he noticed Gaz hustling across the lumberyard toward him. \u201CYou!\u201D Gaz said, pointing at Kaladin. \u201CHold a season.\u201D\r\nKaladin stopped, waiting with folded arms.\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve news for you,\u201D Gaz said, squinting with his good eye. \u201CBrightlord Lamaril heard what you did with the wounded.\u201D\r\n\u201CHow?\u201D\r\n\u201CStorms, boy!\u201D Gaz said. \u201CYou think people wouldn\u2019t talk? What were you going to do? Hide three men in the middle of us all?\u201D\r\nKaladin took a deep breath, but backed down. Gaz was right. \u201CAll right. What does it matter? We didn\u2019t slow the army.\u201D\r\n\u201CYeah,\u201D Gaz said, \u201Cbut Lamaril isn\u2019t too polished on the idea of paying and feeding bridgemen who can\u2019t work. He took the matter to Highprince Sadeas, intending to have you strung up.\u201D\r\nKaladin felt a chill. Strung up would mean hung out during a highstorm for the Stormfather to judge. It was essentially a death sentence. \u201CAnd?\u201D\r\n\u201CBrightlord Sadeas refused to let him do it,\u201D Gaz said.\r\nWhat?Had he misjudged Sadeas? But no. This was part of the act.\r\n\u201CBrightlord Sadeas,\u201D Gaz said grimly, \u201Ctold Lamaril to let you keep the soldiers\u2014but to forbid them food or pay while they\u2019re unable to work. Said it would show why he\u2019s forced to leave bridgemen behind.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat cremling,\u201D Kaladin muttered.\r\nGaz paled. \u201CHush. That\u2019s the highprince himself you\u2019re talking about, boy!\u201D He glanced about to see if anyone had heard.\r\n\u201CHe\u2019s trying to make an example of my men. He wants the other bridgemen to see the wounded suffer and starve. He wants it to seem like he\u2019s doing a\r\nmercyby leaving the wounded behind.\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, maybe he\u2019s right.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s heartless,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CHe brings back wounded soldiers. He leaves the bridgemen because it\u2019s cheaper to find new slaves than it is to care for wounded ones.\u201D\r\nGaz fell silent.\r\n\u201CThank you for bringing me this news.\u201D\r\n\u201CNews?\u201D Gaz snapped. \u201CI was\r\nsentto give you orders, lordling. Don\u2019t try to get extra food from the mess hall for your wounded; you\u2019ll be refused.\u201D With that, he rushed away, muttering to himself.\r\nKaladin made his way back to the barrack.\r\nStormfather!Where was he going to get food enough to feed three men? He could split his own meals with them, but while bridgemen were kept fed, they weren\u2019t given an excess. Even feeding one man beyond himself would be a stretch. Trying to split the meals four ways would leave the wounded too weak to recover and\u00A0Kaladin too weak to run bridges. And he\r\nstillneeded antiseptic! Rotspren and disease killed far more men in war than the enemy did.\r\nKaladin stepped up to the men lounging by the barrack. Most were going about the usual bridgeman activities\u2014sprawled on the ground and despondently staring into the air, sitting and despondently staring at the ground, standing and despondently staring into the distance. Bridge Four wasn\u2019t on bridge duty at all this day, and they didn\u2019t have work detail until third afternoon bell.\r\n\u201CGaz says our wounded are to be refused food or pay until they are well,\u201D Kaladin said to the collected men.\r\nSome of them\u2014Sigzil, Peet, Koolf\u2014nodded, as if this was what they\u2019d expected.\r\n\u201CHighprince Sadeas wants to make an example of us,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CHe wants to\r\nprovethat bridgemen aren\u2019t worth healing, and he\u2019s going to do it by making Hobber, Leyten, and Dabbid die slow, painful deaths.\u201D He took a deep breath. \u201CI want to pool our resources to buy medicine and get food for the wounded. We can keep those three alive if a few of you will split your meals with them. We\u2019ll need about two dozen or so clearmarks to buy the right medicine and supplies. Who has something they can spare?\u201D\r\nThe men stared at him, then Moash started laughing. Others joined him. They waved dismissive hands and broke up, walking away, leaving Kaladin with his hand out. \u201CNext time it could be you!\u201D he called. \u201CWhat will you do if you\u2019re the one that needs healing?\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll die,\u201D Moash said, not even bothering to look back. \u201COut on the field, quickly, rather than back here over a week\u2019s time.\u201D\r\nKaladin lowered his hand. He sighed, turning, and almost ran into Rock. The beefy, towerlike Horneater stood with arms folded, like a tan-skinned statue. Kaladin looked up at him, hopeful.\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t have any spheres,\u201D Rock said with a grunt. \u201CIs all spent already.\u201D\r\nKaladin sighed. \u201CIt wouldn\u2019t have mattered anyway. Two of us couldn\u2019t afford to buy the medicine. Not alone.\u201D\r\n\u201CI will give some food,\u201D Rock grumbled.\r\nKaladin glanced back at him, surprised.\r\n\u201CBut\r\nonlyfor this man with arrow in his leg,\u201D Rock said, arms still folded.\r\n\u201CHobber?\u201D\r\n\u201CWhatever,\u201D Rock said. \u201CHe looks like he could get better. Other one, he will die. Is certain. And I have no pity for man who sits there, not doing anything. But for the other one, you may have my food. Some of it.\u201D\r\nKaladin smiled, raising a hand and gripping the larger man\u2019s arm. \u201CThank you.\u201D\r\nRock shrugged. \u201CYou took my place. Without this thing, I would be dead.\u201D\r\nKaladin smirked at that logic. \u201CI\u2019m not dead, Rock. You\u2019d be fine.\u201D\r\nRock shook his head. \u201CI\u2019d be dead. Is something strange about you. All men can see it, even if they don\u2019t want to speak of this thing. I looked at bridge where you were. Arrows hit all around you\u2014beside your head, next to your hands. But they weren\u2019t hitting you.\u201D\r\n\u201CLuck.\u201D\r\n\u201CIs no such thing.\u201D Rock glanced at Kaladin\u2019s shoulder. \u201CBesides, there is\r\nmafah\u2019likiwho always follows you.\u201D The large Horneater bowed his head reverently to Syl, then made a strange gesture with his hand touching his shoulders and then his forehead.\r\nKaladin started. \u201CYou can\r\nseeher?\u201D He glanced at Syl. As a windspren, she could appear to those she wanted to\u2014and that generally only meant Kaladin.\r\nSyl seemed shocked. No, she hadn\u2019t appeared to Rock specifically.\r\n\u201CI am\r\nalaii\u2019iku,\u201D Rock said, shrugging.\r\n\u201CWhich means\u2026\u201D\r\nRock scowled. \u201CAirsick lowlanders. Is there nothing proper you know? Anyway, you are special man. Bridge Four, it lost eight runners yesterday counting the three wounded.\u201D\r\n\u201CI know,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CI broke my first promise. I said I wasn\u2019t going to lose a single one.\u201D\r\nRock snorted. \u201CWe are bridgemen. We die. Is how this thing works. You might as well promise to make the moons catch each other!\u201D The large man turned, pointing toward one of the other barracks. \u201COf the bridges that were fired upon, most lost many men. Five bridges fell. They lost over twenty men each and needed soldiers to help get bridges back. Bridge Two lost eleven men, and it wasn\u2019t even a focus of firing.\u201D\r\nHe turned back to Kaladin. \u201CBridge Four lost eight. Eight men, during one of the worst runs of the season. And, perhaps, you will save two of those. Bridge Four lost fewest men of any bridge that the Parshendi tried to drop. Bridge Four\r\nneverloses fewest men. Everyone knows how it is.\u201D\r\n\u201CLuck\u2014\u201D\r\nRock pointed a fat finger at him, cutting him off. \u201CAirsick lowlander.\u201D\r\nIt\r\nwasjust luck. But, well, Kaladin would take it for the small blessing it was. No use arguing when someone had finally decided to start listening to him.\r\nBut one man wasn\u2019t enough. Even if both he and Rock went on half rations, one of the sick men would starve. He needed spheres. He needed them desperately. But he was a slave; it was illegal for him to earn money in most ways. If only he had something he could sell. But he owned nothing. He\u2026\r\nA thought occurred to him.\r\n\u201CCome on,\u201D he said, striding away from the barrack. Rock followed curiously. Kaladin searched through the lumberyard until he found Gaz speaking with a bridgeleader in front of Bridge Three\u2019s barrack. As was growing more common, Gaz grew pale when Kaladin approached, and made as if to scurry away.\r\n\u201CGaz, wait!\u201D Kaladin said, holding out his hand. \u201CI have an offer for you.\u201D\r\nThe bridge sergeant froze. Beside Gaz, Bridge Three\u2019s leader shot Kaladin a scowl. The way the other bridgemen had been treating him suddenly made sense. They were perturbed to see Bridge Four come out of a battle in such good shape. Bridge Four was supposed to be unlucky. Everyone needed someone else to look down on\u2014and the other bridge crews could be consoled by the small mercy that they weren\u2019t in Bridge Four. Kaladin had upset that.\r\nThe dark-bearded bridgeleader retreated, leaving Kaladin and Rock alone with Gaz.\r\n\u201CWhat are you offering this time?\u201D Gaz said. \u201CMore dun spheres?\u201D\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D Kaladin said, thinking quickly. This would have to be handled\r\nverycarefully. \u201CI\u2019m out of spheres. But we can\u2019t continue like this, you avoiding me, the other bridge crews hating me.\u201D\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t see what we can do about it.\u201D\r\n\u201CI tell you what,\u201D Kaladin said, as if suddenly having a thought. \u201CIs anyone on stone-gathering detail today?\u201D\r\n\u201CYeah,\u201D Gaz said, gesturing over his shoulder. \u201CBridge Three. Bussik there was just trying to convince me that his team is too weak to go. Storms blast me, but I believe him. Lost two-thirds of his men yesterday, and\r\nI\u2019llbe the one who gets chewed out when they don\u2019t gather enough stones to meet quota.\u201D\r\nKaladin nodded sympathetically. Stone gathering was one of the least desirable work details; it involved traveling outside of the camp and filling wagons with large rocks. Soulcasters fed the army by turning rocks into grain, and it was easier for them\u2014for reasons only they knew\u2014if they had distinct, separate stones. So men gathered rocks. It was menial, sweaty, tiring, mindless work. Perfect for bridgemen.\r\n\u201CWhy don\u2019t you send a different bridge team?\u201D Kaladin asked.\r\n\u201CBah,\u201D Gaz said. \u201CYou know the kind of trouble that makes. If I\u2019m seen playing favorites, I never hear an end of the complaining.\u201D\r\n\u201CNobody will complain if you make Bridge Four do it.\u201D\r\nGaz glanced at him, single eye narrowed. \u201CI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d react well to being treated differently.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll do it,\u201D Kaladin said, grimacing. \u201CJust this once. Look, Gaz, I don\u2019t want to spend the rest of my time here fighting against you.\u201D\r\nGaz hesitated. \u201CYour men are going to be angry. I won\u2019t let them think it was me who did this to them.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll tell them that it was my idea.\u201D\r\n\u201CAll right, then. Third bell, meet at the western checkpoint. Bridge Three can clean pots.\u201D He walked away quickly, as if to escape before Kaladin changed his mind.\r\nRock stepped up beside Kaladin, watching Gaz. \u201CThe little man is right, you know. The men will\r\nhateyou for this thing. They were looking forward to easy day.\u201D\r\n\u201CThey\u2019ll get over it.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut why change for harder work? Is true\u2014you are crazy, aren\u2019t you?\u201D\r\n\u201CMaybe. But that craziness will get us outside of the warcamp.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat good is that?\u201D\r\n\u201CIt means everything,\u201D Kaladin said, glancing back at the barrack. \u201CIt means life and death. But we\u2019re going to need more help.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnother bridge crew?\u201D\r\n\u201CNo, I mean that we\u2014you and I\u2014will need help. One more man, at least.\u201D He scanned the lumberyard, and noted someone sitting in the shadow of Bridge Four\u2019s barrack. Teft. The grizzled bridgeman hadn\u2019t been among the group that had laughed at Kaladin earlier, but he\r\nhadbeen quick to help yesterday, going with Rock to carry Leyten.\r\nKaladin took a deep breath and strode out across the grounds, Rock trailing behind. Syl left his shoulder and zipped into the air, dancing on a sudden gust of wind. Teft looked up as Kaladin and Rock approached. The older man had fetched breakfast, and he was eating alone, a piece of flatbread peeking out beneath his bowl.\r\nHis beard was stained by the curry, and he regarded Kaladin with wary eyes before wiping his mouth on his sleeve. \u201CI like my food, son,\u201D he said. \u201CHardly think they feed me enough for one man. Let alone two.\u201D\r\nKaladin squatted in front of him. Rock leaned up against the wall and folded his arms, watching quietly.\r\n\u201CI need you, Teft,\u201D Kaladin said.\r\n\u201CI said\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CNot your food. You. Your loyalty. Your allegiance.\u201D\r\nThe older man continued to eat. He didn\u2019t have a slave brand, and neither did Rock. Kaladin didn\u2019t know their stories. All he knew was that these two had helped when others hadn\u2019t. They weren\u2019t completely beaten down.\r\n\u201CTeft\u2014\u201D Kaladin began.\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve given my loyalty before,\u201D the man said. \u201CToo many times now. Always works out the same.\u201D\r\n\u201CYour trust gets betrayed?\u201D Kaladin asked softly.\r\nTeft snorted. \u201CStorms, no. I betray\r\nit. You can\u2019t depend on me, son. I belong here, as a bridgeman.\u201D\r\n\u201CI depended on you yesterday, and you impressed me.\u201D\r\n\u201CFluke.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll judge that,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CTeft, we\u2019re\r\nallbroken, in one way or another. Otherwise we wouldn\u2019t be bridgemen. I\u2019ve failed. My own brother died because of me.\u201D\r\n\u201CSo why keep caring?\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s either that or give up and die.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd if death is better?\u201D\r\nIt came back to this problem. This was why the bridgemen didn\u2019t care if he helped the wounded or not.\r\n\u201CDeath isn\u2019t better,\u201D Kaladin said, looking Teft in the eyes. \u201COh, it\u2019s easy to say that now. But when you stand on the ledge and look down into that dark, endless pit, you change your mind. Just like Hobber did. Just like I\u2019ve done.\u201D He hesitated, seeing something in the older man\u2019s eyes. \u201CI think you\u2019ve seen it too.\u201D\r\n\u201CAye,\u201D Teft said softly. \u201CAye, I have.\u201D\r\n\u201CSo, are you with us in this thing?\u201D Rock said, squatting down.\r\nUs?Kaladin thought, smiling faintly.\r\nTeft looked back and forth between the two of them. \u201CI get to keep my food?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D Kaladin said.\r\nTeft shrugged. \u201CAll right then, I guess. Can\u2019t be any harder than sitting here and having a staring contest with mortality.\u201D\r\nKaladin held out a hand. Teft hesitated, then took it.\r\nRock held out a hand. \u201CRock.\u201D\r\nTeft looked at him, finished shaking Kaladin\u2019s hand, then took Rock\u2019s. \u201CI\u2019m Teft.\u201D\r\nStormfather,Kaladin thought.\r\nI\u2019d forgotten that most of them don\u2019t even bother to learn each other\u2019s names.\r\n\u201CWhat kind of name is Rock?\u201D Teft asked, releasing the hand.\r\n\u201CIs a stupid one,\u201D Rock said with an even face. \u201CBut at least it has meaning. Does your name mean anything?\u201D\r\n\u201CI guess not,\u201D Teft said, rubbing his bearded chin.\r\n\u201CRock, this is not my real name,\u201D the Horneater admitted. \u201CIs just what lowlanders can pronounce.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat\u2019s your real name, then?\u201D Teft asked.\r\n\u201CYou won\u2019t be able to say it.\u201D\r\nTeft raised an eyebrow.\r\n\u201CNumuhukumakiaki\u2019aialunamor,\u201D Rock said.\r\nTeft hesitated, then smiled. \u201CWell, I guess in that case, Rock will do just fine.\u201D\r\nRock laughed, settling down. \u201COur bridgeleader has a plan. Something glorious and daring. Has something to do with spending our afternoon moving stones in the heat.\u201D\r\nKaladin smiled, leaning forward. \u201CWe need to gather a certain kind of plant. A reed that grows in small patches outside the camp\u2026.\u201D"

      "ChapterName": "22: EYES, HANDS, OR SPHERES?",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\nIn case you have turned a blind eye to that disaster, know that Aona and Skai are both dead, and that which they held has been Splintered. Presumably to prevent anyone from rising up to challenge Rayse.\r\nTwo days after the incident with the highstorm, Dalinar walked with his sons, crossing the rocky ground toward the king\u2019s feasting basin.\r\nDalinar\u2019s stormwardens projected another few weeks of spring, followed by a return to summer. Hopefully it wouldn\u2019t turn to winter instead.\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve been to three more leatherworkers,\u201D Adolin said softly. \u201CThey have different opinions. It seems that even before the strap was cut\u2014if it was cut\u2014it was worn, so that\u2019s interfering with things. The best consensus has been that the strap\r\nwassliced, but not necessarily by a knife. It could have just been natural wear-and-tear.\u201D\r\nDalinar nodded. \u201CThat\u2019s the only evidence that even hints there might be something odd about the girth breaking.\u201D\r\n\u201CSo we admit that this was just a result of the king\u2019s paranoia.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll talk to Elhokar,\u201D Dalinar decided. \u201CLet him know we\u2019ve run into a wall and see if there are any other avenues he\u2019d like us to pursue.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat\u2019ll do.\u201D Adolin seemed to grow hesitant about something. \u201CFather. Do you want to talk about what happened during the storm?\u201D\r\n\u201CIt was nothing that hasn\u2019t happened before.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CEnjoy the evening, Adolin,\u201D Dalinar said firmly. \u201CI\u2019m all right. Perhaps it\u2019s good for the men to see what is happening. Hiding it has only inspired rumors, some of them even worse than the truth.\u201D\r\nAdolin sighed, but nodded.\r\nThe king\u2019s feasts were always outdoors, at the foot of Elhokar\u2019s palace hill. If the stormwardens warned of a highstorm\u2014or if more mundane weather turned bad\u2014then the feast was canceled. Dalinar was glad for the outdoor location. Even with ornamentation, Soulcast buildings felt like caverns.\r\nThe feast basin had been flooded, turning it into a shallow artificial lake. Circular dining platforms rose like small stone islands in the water. The elaborate miniature landscape had been fabricated by the king\u2019s Soulcasters, who had diverted the water from a nearby stream.\r\nIt reminds me of Sela Tales,Dalinar thought as he crossed the first bridge. He\u2019d visited that western region of Roshar during his youth.\r\nAnd the Purelake.\r\nThere were five islands, and the railings of the bridges connecting them were done in scrollwork so fine that after each feast, the railings had to be stowed away lest a highstorm ruin them. Tonight, flowers floated in the slow current. Periodically, a miniature boat\u2014only a handspan wide\u2014sailed past, bearing an infused gemstone.\r\nDalinar, Renarin, and Adolin stepped onto the first dining platform. \u201COne cup of blue,\u201D Dalinar said to his sons. \u201CAfter that, keep to the orange.\u201D\r\nAdolin sighed audibly. \u201CCouldn\u2019t we, just this once\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CSo long as you are of my house, you follow the Codes. My will is firm, Adolin.\u201D\r\n\u201CFine,\u201D Adolin said. \u201CCome on, Renarin.\u201D The two broke off from Dalinar to remain on the first platform, where the younger lighteyes congregated.\r\nDalinar crossed to the next island. This middle one was for the lesser lighteyes. To its left and right lay the segregated dining islands\u2014men\u2019s island on the right, women\u2019s island on the left. On the three central ones, however, the genders mingled.\r\nAround him, the favored invitees took advantage of their king\u2019s hospitality. Soulcast food was inherently bland, but the king\u2019s lavish feasts always served imported spices and exotic meats. Dalinar could smell roasting pork on the air, and even chickens. It had been a long time since he\u2019d been served meat from one of the strange Shin flying creatures.\r\nA darkeyed servant passed, wearing a gauzy red robe and carrying a tray of orange crab legs. Dalinar continued across the island, weaving around groups of revelers. Most drank violet wine, the most intoxicating and flavorful of the colors. Almost no one was in battle attire. A few men wore tight, waist-length jackets, but many had dropped all pretense, choosing instead loose silk shirts with ruffled cuffs worn with matching slippers. The rich material glistened in the lamplight.\r\nThese creatures of fashion shot glances at Dalinar, appraising him, weighing him. He could remember a time when he would have been swarmed by friends, acquaintances\u2014and yes, even sycophants\u2014at a feast like this. Now, none approached him, though they gave way before him. Elhokar might think his uncle was growing weak, but his reputation quelled most lesser lighteyes.\r\nHe soon approached the bridge to the final island\u2014the king\u2019s island. Pole-mounted gem lamps ringed it, glowing with blue Stormlight, and a firepit dominated the center of the platform. Deep red coals simmered in its bowels, radiating warmth. Elhokar sat at his table just behind the firepit, and several highprinces ate with him. Tables along the sides of the platform were occupied by male or female diners\u2014never both at the same.\r\nWit sat on a raised stool at the end of the bridge leading onto the island. Wit actually dressed as a lighteyes should\u2014he wore a stiff black uniform, silver sword at his waist. Dalinar shook his head at the irony.\r\nWit was insulting each person as they stepped onto the island. \u201CBrightness Marakal! What a disaster that hairstyle is; how brave of you to show it to the world. Brightlord Marakal, I wish you\u2019d warned us you were going to attend; I\u2019d have forgone supper. I do so hate being sick after a full meal. Brightlord Cadilar! How good it is to see you. Your face reminds me of someone dear to me.\u201D\r\n\u201CReally?\u201D wizened Cadilar said, hesitating.\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D Wit said, waving him on, \u201Cmy horse. Ah, Brightlord Neteb, you smell unique today\u2014did you attack a wet whitespine, or did one just sneeze on you? Lady Alami! No, please, don\u2019t speak\u2014it\u2019s much easier to maintain my illusions regarding your intelligence that way. And Brightlord Dalinar.\u201D Wit nodded to Dalinar as he passed. \u201CAh, my dear Brightlord Taselin. Still engaged in your experiment to prove a maximum threshold of human idiocy? Good for you! Very empirical of you.\u201D\r\nDalinar hesitated beside Wit\u2019s chair as Taselin waddled by with a huff. \u201CWit,\u201D Dalinar said, \u201Cdo you have to?\u201D\r\n\u201CTwo what, Dalinar?\u201D Wit said, eyes twinkling. \u201CEyes, hands, or spheres? I\u2019d lend you one of the first, but\u2014by definition\u2014a man can only have one I, and if it is given away, who would be Wit then? I\u2019d lend you one of the second, but I fear my simple hands have been digging in the muck far too often to suit one such as you. And if I gave you one of my spheres, what would I spend the remaining one on? I\u2019m quite attached to both of my spheres, you see.\u201D He hesitated. \u201COr, well, you\r\ncan\u2019tsee. Would you like to?\u201D He stood up off his chair and reached for his belt.\r\n\u201CWit,\u201D Dalinar said dryly.\r\nWit laughed, clapping Dalinar on the arm. \u201CI\u2019m sorry. This lot brings out the basest humor in me. Perhaps it\u2019s that muck I spoke of earlier. I do try so hard to be elevated in my loathing of them, but they make it difficult.\u201D\r\n\u201CCare for yourself, Wit,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CThis lot won\u2019t suffer you forever. I wouldn\u2019t see you dead by their knives; I see a fine man within you.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D Wit said, scanning the platform. \u201CHe tasted quite delicious. Dalinar, I fear I\u2019m not the one who needs that warning. Speak your fears at a mirror a few times when you get home tonight. There are rumors about.\u201D\r\n\u201CRumors?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes. Terrible things. Grow on men like warts.\u201D\r\n\u201CTumors?\u201D\r\n\u201CBoth. Look, there is talk about you.\u201D\r\n\u201CThere is always talk about me.\u201D\r\n\u201CThis is worse than most,\u201D Wit said, meeting his eyes. \u201CDid you really speak of abandoning the Vengeance Pact?\u201D\r\nDalinar took a deep breath. \u201CThat was between me and the king.\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, he must have spoken of it to others. This lot are cowards\u2014and no doubt that makes them feel like experts on the subject, for they\u2019ve certainly been calling you that a great deal lately.\u201D\r\n\u201CStormfather!\u201D\r\n\u201CNo, I\u2019m Wit. But I understand how easy a mistake that is to make.\u201D\r\n\u201CBecause you blow so much air,\u201D Dalinar growled, \u201Cor because you make so much noise?\u201D\r\nA wide smile split Wit\u2019s face. \u201CWhy, Dalinar! I\u2019m impressed! Maybe I should make\r\nyouWit! Then I could be a highprince instead.\u201D He stopped. \u201CNo, that would be bad. I\u2019d go mad after a mere second of listening to them, then would likely slaughter the lot. Perhaps appoint cremlings in their places. The kingdom would undoubtedly fare better.\u201D\r\nDalinar turned to go. \u201CThank you for the warning.\u201D\r\nWit sat back down on his stool as Dalinar walked away. \u201CYou\u2019re welcome. Ah, Brightlord Habatab! How thoughtful of you to wear a red shirt with a sunburn like that! If you continue to make my job this easy, I fear my mind shall become as dull as Brightlord Tumul\u2019s! Oh, Brightlord Tumul! How unexpected it is to see you standing there! I didn\u2019t mean to insult your stupidity. Really, it\u2019s quite spectacular and worthy of much praise. Lord Yonatan and Lady Meirav, I\u2019ll forgo an insult for you this once on account of your recent wedding, though I do find your hat quite impressive, Yonatan. I trust it is convenient to wear on your head something that doubles as a tent at night. Ah, and is that Lady\r\nNavanibehind you? How long have you been back at the Plains and how did I not notice the smell?\u201D\r\nDalinar froze.\r\nWhat?\r\n\u201CObviously your own stench overpowered mine, Wit,\u201D a warm feminine voice said. \u201CHas no one done my son a service and assassinated you yet?\u201D\r\n\u201CNo, no assassins yet,\u201D Wit said, amused. \u201CI guess I\u2019ve already got too much ass sass of my own.\u201D\r\nDalinar turned with shock. Navani, the king\u2019s mother, was a stately woman with intricately woven black hair. And she was\r\nnotsupposed to be here.\r\n\u201COh really, Wit,\u201D she said. \u201CI thought that kind of humor was beneath you.\u201D\r\n\u201CSo are you, technically,\u201D Wit said, smiling, from atop his high-legged stool.\r\nShe rolled her eyes.\r\n\u201CUnfortunately, Brightness,\u201D Wit replied with a sigh, \u201CI\u2019ve taken to framing my insults in terms this lot will understand. If it will please you, I shall attempt to improve my diction to more elevated terms.\u201D He paused. \u201CI say, do you know any words that rhyme with bescumber?\u201D\r\nNavani just turned her head and looked at Dalinar with a pair of light violet eyes. She wore an elegant dress, its shimmering red surface unbroken by embroidery. The gems in her hair\u2014which was streaked with a few lines of grey\u2014were red as well. The king\u2019s mother was known as one of the most beautiful women in Alethkar, though Dalinar had always found that description inadequate, for surely there wasn\u2019t a woman on all of Roshar to match her beauty.\r\nFool,he thought, tearing his eyes away from her.\r\nYour brother\u2019s widow.With Gavilar dead, Navani was now to be treated as Dalinar\u2019s sister. Besides, what of his own wife? Dead these ten years, wiped by his foolishness from his mind. Even if he couldn\u2019t remember her, he should honor her.\r\nWhy had Navani returned? As women called out greetings to her, Dalinar hurriedly made his way over to the king\u2019s table. He sat down; a servant arrived in moments with a plate for him\u2014they knew his preferences.\r\nIt was steaming peppered chicken, cut in medallions and laid atop fried round slices of tenem, a soft, light orange vegetable. Dalinar grabbed a piece of flatbread and slipped his dining knife from the sheath on his right calf. So long as he was eating, it would be a breach of etiquette for Navani to approach him.\r\nThe food was good. It always was at these feasts of Elhokar\u2019s\u2014in that, the son was like the father. Elhokar nodded to Dalinar from the end of the table, then continued his conversation with Sadeas. Highprince Roion sat a few seats down from him. Dalinar had an appointment with him in a few days, the first of the highprinces he\u2019d approach and try to convince to work with him on a joint plateau assault.\r\nNo other highprinces came to sit near Dalinar. Only they\u2014and people with specific invitations\u2014could sit at the king\u2019s table. One man lucky enough to receive such an invitation sat on Elhokar\u2019s left, obviously uncertain if he should join in the conversation or not.\r\nWater gurgled in the stream behind Dalinar. Before him, the festivities continued. It was a time for relaxation, but the Alethi were a reserved people, at least when compared with more passionate folk like the Horneaters or the Reshi. Still, his people seemed to have grown more opulent and self-indulgent since his childhood. Wine flowed freely and foods sizzled fragrantly. On the first island, several young men had stepped into a sparring ring for a friendly duel. Young men at a feast often found reason to remove their coats and show off their swordsmanship.\r\nThe women were more modest with their displays, but they engaged in them as well. On Dalinar\u2019s own island, several women had set up easels where they were sketching, painting, or doing calligraphy. As always, they kept their left hands shrouded in their sleeves, delicately creating art with the right. They sat on high stools, the kind that Wit had been using\u2014in fact, Wit had probably stolen one for his little performance. A few of them attracted creationspren, the tiny shapes rolling across the tops of their easels or tables.\r\nNavani had gathered a group of important lighteyed women to a table. A servant passed by in front of Dalinar, bringing the women some food. It appeared to also have been made with the exotic chicken, but had been mixed with steamed methi fruit and covered in a reddish-brown sauce. As a boy, Dalinar had secretly tried women\u2019s food out of curiosity. He\u2019d found it distastefully sweet.\r\nNavani placed something on her table, a device of polished brass about the size of a fist, with a large, infused ruby at its center. The red Stormlight lit the entire table, throwing shadows down the white tablecloth. Navani picked up the device, rotating it to show her dinner companions its leglike protrusions. Turned that way, it looked vaguely crustacean.\r\nI\u2019ve never seen a fabrial like that before.Dalinar looked up at her face, admiring the contours of her cheek. Navani was a renowned artifabrian. Perhaps this device was\u2014\r\nNavani glanced at him, and Dalinar froze. She flashed the briefest of smiles at him, covert and knowing, then turned away before he could react.\r\nStorming woman!he thought, pointedly turning his attention to his meal.\r\nHe was hungry, and got so involved in his food that he almost didn\u2019t notice Adolin approaching. The blond youth saluted Elhokar, then hurried to take one of the vacant seats beside Dalinar. \u201CFather,\u201D Adolin said in a hushed tone, \u201Chave you heard what they\u2019re saying?\u201D\r\n\u201CAbout what?\u201D\r\n\u201CAbout you! I\u2019ve fought three duels so far against men who described you\u2014and our house\u2014as cowards. They\u2019re saying you asked the king to abandon the Vengeance Pact!\u201D\r\nDalinar gripped the table and nearly rose to his feet. But he stopped himself. \u201CLet them speak if they wish,\u201D he said, turning back to his meal, stabbing a chunk of peppered chicken with his knife and raising it to his lips.\r\n\u201CDid you really do it?\u201D Adolin asked. \u201CIs that what you talked about at the meeting with the king two days back?\u201D\r\n\u201CIt is,\u201D Dalinar admitted.\r\nThat elicited a groan from Adolin. \u201CI was worried already. When I\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CAdolin,\u201D Dalinar interjected. \u201CDo you trust me?\u201D\r\nAdolin looked at him, the youth\u2019s eyes wide, honest, but pained. \u201CI want to. Storms, Father. I really want to.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat I am doing is important. It\r\nmust be done.\u201D\r\nAdolin leaned in, speaking softly. \u201CAnd what if they\r\naredelusions? What if you\u2019re just\u2026getting old.\u201D\r\nIt was the first time someone had confronted him with it so directly. \u201CI would be lying if I didn\u2019t admit that I\u2019d considered it, but there was no sense in second-guessing myself. I believe they\u2019re real. I\r\nfeelthey\u2019re real.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CThis is not the place for this discussion, son,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CWe can talk of it later, and I will listen to\u2014and consider\u2014your objections. I promise.\u201D\r\nAdolin drew his lips to a line. \u201CVery well.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou are right to be worried for our reputation,\u201D Dalinar said, resting an elbow on the table. \u201CI had assumed that Elhokar would have the tact to keep our conversation quiet, but I should have asked him to do so directly. You were right about his reaction, by the way. I realized during the conversation he would never retreat, so I changed to another tactic.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhich is?\u201D\r\n\u201CWinning the war,\u201D Dalinar said firmly. \u201CNo more scuffling over gemhearts. No more patient, indefinite siege. We find a way to lure a large number of Parshendi onto the Plains, then execute an ambush. If we can kill a large enough number of them, we destroy their capacity to wage war. Failing that, we find a way to strike at their center and kill or capture their leaders. Even a chasmfiend stops fighting when it\u2019s been decapitated. The Vengeance Pact would be fulfilled, and we could go home.\u201D\r\nAdolin took a long moment considering, then he nodded sharply. \u201CAll right.\u201D\r\n\u201CNo objections?\u201D Dalinar asked. Normally, his elder son had plenty.\r\n\u201CYou just asked me to trust you,\u201D Adolin said. \u201CBesides, striking harder at the Parshendi? That\u2019s a tactic I can get behind. We\u2019ll need a good plan, though\u2014a way to counter the very objections you yourself raised six years ago.\u201D\r\nDalinar nodded, tapping the table with his finger. \u201CBack then, even I thought of us as separate princedoms. If we had attacked the center individually, each army alone, we\u2019d have been surrounded and destroyed. But if all ten armies went together? With our Soulcasters to provide food, with the soldiers carrying portable shelters to set up for highstorms? Over a hundred and fifty thousand troops? Let the Parshendi try to surround us then. With the Soulcasters, we could even create wood for bridges if we had to.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat would take a lot of trust,\u201D Adolin said hesitantly. He glanced down the high table, toward Sadeas. His expression darkened. \u201CWe\u2019d be stuck out there, together and isolated, for days. If the highprinces started squabbling midmarch, it could be disastrous.\u201D\r\n\u201CWe\u2019ll get them to work together first,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CWe\u2019re close, closer than we\u2019ve ever been. Six years, and not a single highprince has allowed his soldiers to skirmish against those of another.\u201D\r\nExcept back in Alethkar. There, they still fought meaningless battles over land rights or old offenses. It was ridiculous, but stopping the Alethi from warring was like trying to stop the winds from blowing.\r\nAdolin was nodding. \u201CIt\u2019s a good plan, Father. Far better than talk of retreating. They won\u2019t like giving up the plateau skirmishes, though. They like the game of it.\u201D\r\n\u201CI know. But if I can get one or two of them to start pooling soldiers and resources for plateau assaults, it might be a step toward what we\u2019ll need for the future. I\u2019d still rather find a way to lure a large force of Parshendi out onto the Plains and meet them on one of the larger plateaus, but I haven\u2019t yet been able to figure out how to do that. Either way, our separate armies will need to learn to work together.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd what do we do about what people are saying about you?\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll release an official refutation,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CI\u2019ll have to be careful not to make it sound like the king was in error, while also explaining the truth.\u201D\r\nAdolin sighed. \u201CAn official refutation, Father?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhy not fight a duel?\u201D Adolin asked, leaning in, sounding eager. \u201CSome stuffy pronouncement may explain your ideas, but it won\u2019t make people\r\nfeelthem. Pick someone who is naming you coward, challenge them, and remind everyone what a mistake it is to insult the Blackthorn!\u201D\r\n\u201CI cannot,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CThe Codes forbid it for one of my stature.\u201D Adolin probably shouldn\u2019t be dueling either, but Dalinar had not forced a\u00A0complete prohibition on him. Dueling was his life. Well, that and the women he courted.\r\n\u201CThen charge me with the honor of our house,\u201D Adolin said. \u201CI\u2019ll duel them! I\u2019ll face them with Plate and Blade and show them what your honor means.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat would be the same thing as me doing it, son.\u201D\r\nAdolin shook his head, staring at Dalinar. He seemed to be searching for something.\r\n\u201CWhat?\u201D Dalinar asked.\r\n\u201CI\u2019m trying to decide,\u201D Adolin said. \u201CWhich one has changed you most. The visions, the Codes, or that book. If there\u2019s any difference between them.\u201D\r\n\u201CThe Codes are separate from the other two,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CThey are a tradition of old Alethkar.\u201D\r\n\u201CNo. They\u2019re related, Father. All three. They\u2019re tied together in you, somehow.\u201D\r\nDalinar thought on that for a moment. Could the lad have a point? \u201CHave I told you the story of the king carrying the boulder?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D Adolin said.\r\n\u201CI have?\u201D\r\n\u201CTwice. And you made me listen to the passage being read another time.\u201D\r\n\u201COh. Well, in that same section, there\u2019s a passage about the nature of\r\nforcingpeople to follow you as opposed to\r\nlettingthem follow you. We do too much forcing in Alethkar. Dueling someone because they claim I\u2019m a\u00A0coward doesn\u2019t change their beliefs. It might stop them from making the claims, but it doesn\u2019t change hearts. I know I\u2019m right about this. You\u2019ll just have to trust me on this as well.\u201D\r\nAdolin sighed, standing. \u201CWell, an official refutation is better than nothing, I guess. At least you haven\u2019t given up on defending our honor entirely.\u201D\r\n\u201CI never will,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CI just need to be careful. I cannot afford to divide us any further.\u201D He turned back to his meal, stabbing his last piece of chicken with his knife and shoving it in his mouth.\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll get back to the other island, then,\u201D Adolin said. \u201CI\u2026Wait, is that\r\nAunt Navani?\u201D\r\nDalinar looked up, surprised to see Navani walking toward them. Dalinar glanced at his plate. His food was gone; he\u2019d eaten the last bit without realizing it.\r\nHe sighed, steeling himself, and rose to greet her. \u201CMathana,\u201D Dalinar said, bowing and using the formal term for an older sister. Navani was only three months his senior, but it was still applicable.\r\n\u201CDalinar,\u201D she said, a faint smile on her lips. \u201CAnd dear Adolin.\u201D\r\nAdolin smiled broadly; he rounded the table and hugged his aunt. She rested her clothed safehand on his shoulder, a gesture reserved only for family.\r\n\u201CWhen did you return?\u201D Adolin asked, releasing her.\r\n\u201CJust this afternoon.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd\r\nwhydid you return?\u201D Dalinar asked stiffly. \u201CI was under the impression that you were going to aid the queen in protecting the king\u2019s interests in Alethkar.\u201D\r\n\u201COh, Dalinar,\u201D Navani said, voice fond. \u201CSo stiff, as always. Adolin, dear, how goes courtship?\u201D\r\nDalinar snorted. \u201CHe continues to change partners like he\u2019s in a dance that involves particularly quick music.\u201D\r\n\u201CFather!\u201D Adolin objected.\r\n\u201CWell, good for you, Adolin,\u201D Navani said. \u201CYou\u2019re too young to get tied down. The purpose of youth is to experience variety while it is still interesting.\u201D She glanced at Dalinar. \u201CIt isn\u2019t until we get older that we should be forced to be boring.\u201D\r\n\u201CThank you, Aunt,\u201D Adolin said with a grin. \u201CExcuse me. I need to go tell Renarin that you\u2019ve returned.\u201D He hurried away, leaving Dalinar standing awkwardly across the table from Navani.\r\n\u201CAm I that much of a threat, Dalinar?\u201D Navani asked, raising an eyebrow at him.\r\nDalinar glanced down, realizing that he was still gripping his dining knife\u2014a wide, serrated blade that could double as a weapon in a pinch. He let it clatter to the table, then winced at the noise. All of the confidence he\u2019d felt speaking with Adolin seemed gone in a heartbeat.\r\nCompose yourself!he thought.\r\nShe\u2019s just family.Every time he spoke with Navani, he felt as if he were facing a predator of the most dangerous breed.\r\n\u201CMathana,\u201D Dalinar said, realizing they were still standing on opposite sides of the narrow table. \u201CPerhaps we should move to\u2026\u201D\r\nHe trailed off as Navani waved to an attending girl who was barely old enough to wear a woman\u2019s sleeve. The child rushed forward, bearing a low stool. Navani pointed to the spot beside her, a spot only a few feet from the table. The child hesitated, but Navani pointed more insistently and the child set the stool down.\r\nNavani sat gracefully, not sitting\r\natthe king\u2019s table\u2014which was a masculine dining place\u2014but certainly sitting near enough to be challenging protocol. The serving girl withdrew. At the end of the table, Elhokar noticed his mother\u2019s actions, but said nothing. One did not reprove Navani Kholin, not even if one were king.\r\n\u201COh, sit down, Dalinar,\u201D she said, voice growing testy. \u201CWe have matters of some moment to discuss.\u201D\r\nDalinar sighed, but sat. The seats around them were still empty, and both the music and the hum of conversation on the island were loud enough to keep people from overhearing them. Some women had taken to playing flutes, musicspren spinning around them in the air.\r\n\u201CYou ask why I returned,\u201D Navani said, voice soft. \u201CWell, I have three reasons. First, I wanted to bring word that the Vedens have perfected their \u2018half-shards\u2019 as they call them. They\u2019re claiming the shields can stop blows from a Shardblade.\u201D\r\nDalinar folded his arms before him on the table. He\u2019d heard rumors of this, though he\u2019d discounted them. Men were always claiming to be close to creating new Shards, yet the promises were never fulfilled. \u201CHave you seen one?\u201D\r\n\u201CNo. But I have confirmation from someone I trust. She says they can only take the shape of a shield and don\u2019t lend any of Plate\u2019s other enhancements. But they\r\ncanblock a Shardblade.\u201D\r\nIt was a step\u2014a very small step\u2014toward Shardplate. That was disturbing. He wouldn\u2019t believe it himself until he\u2019d seen what these \u201Chalf-shards\u201D could do. \u201CYou could have sent this news via spanreed, Navani.\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, I realized soon after reaching Kholinar that leaving here had been a political mistake. More and more, these warcamps are the true center of our kingdom.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D Dalinar said quietly. \u201COur absence from our homeland is dangerous.\u201D Hadn\u2019t that been the very argument that had convinced Navani to go home in the first place?\r\nThe stately woman waved a dismissive hand. \u201CI have determined that the queen is sufficiently endowed with the requisite skills needed to hold Alethkar. There are schemes and plots\u2014there will always be schemes and plots\u2014but the truly important players inevitably make their way here.\u201D\r\n\u201CYour son continues to see assassins around every corner,\u201D Dalinar said softly.\r\n\u201CAnd shouldn\u2019t he? After what happened to his father\u2026\u201D\r\n\u201CTrue, but I fear he carries it to extremes. He mistrusts even his allies.\u201D\r\nNavani folded her hands in her lap, freehand lying atop safehand. \u201CHe\u2019s not very good at this, is he?\u201D\r\nDalinar blinked in shock. \u201CWhat? Elhokar is a good man! He has more integrity than any other lighteyes in this army.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut his rule is weak,\u201D Navani said. \u201CYou must admit that.\u201D\r\n\u201CHe is king,\u201D Dalinar said firmly, \u201Cand my nephew. He has both my sword and my heart, Navani, and I will not hear ill spoken of him, even by his own mother.\u201D\r\nShe eyed him. Was she testing his loyalty? Much like her daughter, Navani was a political creature. Intrigue made her blossom like a rockbud in calm wet air. However, unlike Jasnah, Navani was hard to trust. At least with Jasnah one knew where one stood\u2014once again, Dalinar found himself wishing she\u2019d put aside her projects and return to the Shattered Plains.\r\n\u201CI\u2019m not speaking ill of my son, Dalinar,\u201D Navani said. \u201CWe both know I am as loyal to him as you are. But I like to know what I\u2019m working with, and that requires a definition. He is seen as weak, and I intend to see him protected. Despite himself, if necessary.\u201D\r\n\u201CThen we work for the same goals. But if protecting him was the second reason you returned, what was the third?\u201D\r\nShe smiled a violet-eyed, red-lipped smile at him. A meaningful smile.\r\nBlood of my ancestors\u2026Dalinar thought.\r\nStormwinds, but she\u2019s beautiful. Beautiful and deadly.It seemed a particular irony to him that his wife\u2019s face had been erased from his mind, and yet he could remember in complete and intricate detail the months this woman had spent toying with him and Gavilar. She\u2019d played them off one another, fanning their desire before finally choosing the elder son.\r\nThey\u2019d all known the entire time that she would choose Gavilar. It had hurt anyway.\r\n\u201CWe need to talk sometime in private,\u201D Navani said. \u201CI want to hear your opinion on some of the things being said in camp.\u201D\r\nThat probably meant the rumors about him. \u201CI\u2014I\u2019m very busy.\u201D\r\nShe rolled her eyes. \u201CI\u2019m sure you are. We\u2019re meeting anyway, once I\u2019ve had time to settle here and put out feelers. How about one week from today? I\u2019ll come read to you from that book of my husband\u2019s, and afterward we can chat. We\u2019ll do it in a public place. All right?\u201D\r\nHe sighed. \u201CVery well. But\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CHighprinces and lighteyes,\u201D Elhokar\u2019s suddenly proclaimed. Dalinar and Navani turned toward the end of the table, where the king stood wearing his uniform complete with royal cape and crown. He raised a hand toward the island. The people hushed, and soon the only sound was that of the water burbling through the streams.\r\n\u201CI\u2019m sure many of you have heard the rumors regarding the attempt on my life during the hunt three days ago,\u201D Elhokar announced. \u201CWhen my saddle girth was cut.\u201D\r\nDalinar glanced at Navani. She raised her freehand toward him and rocked it back and forth, indicating that she didn\u2019t find the rumors to be persuasive. She knew about the rumors, of course. Give Navani five minutes in a city and she\u2019d know anything and everything of significance being gossiped about.\r\n\u201CI assure you, I was never in real danger,\u201D Elhokar said. \u201CThanks, in part, to the protection of the King\u2019s Guard and the vigilance of my uncle. However, I believe it wise to treat all threats with due prudence and seriousness. Therefore, I am appointing Brightlord Torol Sadeas to be Highprince of Information, charging him to unearth the truth regarding this attempt on my life.\u201D\r\nDalinar blinked in shock. Then he closed his eyes and let out a soft groan.\r\n\u201CUnearth the truth,\u201D Navani said skeptically. \u201CSadeas?\u201D\r\n\u201CBlood of my\u2026He thinks I\u2019m ignoring the threats to him, so he\u2019s looking to Sadeas instead.\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, I suppose that\u2019s all right,\u201D she said. \u201CI\r\nkind oftrust Sadeas.\u201D\r\n\u201CNavani,\u201D Dalinar said, opening his eyes. \u201CThe incident happened on a hunt I planned, under the protection of my guard and my soldiers. The king\u2019s horse was prepared by my grooms. He publicly asked me to look into this strap business, and now he\u2019s just taken the investigation away from me.\u201D\r\n\u201COh dear.\u201D She understood. This was nearly the same thing as Elhokar proclaiming that he suspected Dalinar. Any information Sadeas unearthed regarding this \u201Cassassination attempt\u201D could only reflect unfavorably on Dalinar.\r\nWhen Sadeas\u2019s hatred of Dalinar and his love of Gavilar conflicted, which would win?\r\nBut the vision. It said to trust him.\r\nElhokar sat back down, and the buzz of conversation resumed across the island at a higher pitch. The king seemed oblivious of what he had just done. Sadeas was smiling broadly. He rose from his place, bidding farewell to the king, then began mingling.\r\n\u201CYou still argue he isn\u2019t a bad king?\u201D Navani whispered. \u201CMy poor, distracted, oblivious boy.\u201D\r\nDalinar stood up, then walked down the table to where the king continued to eat.\r\nElhokar looked up. \u201CAh, Dalinar. I suspect you\u2019ll want to give Sadeas your aid.\u201D\r\nDalinar sat down. Sadeas\u2019s half-eaten meal still sat on the table, brass plate scattered with chunks of meat and torn flatbread. \u201CElhokar,\u201D Dalinar forced out, \u201CI just spoke to you a few days ago. I asked to be Highprince of War, and you said it was too dangerous!\u201D\r\n\u201CIt is,\u201D Elhokar said. \u201CI spoke to Sadeas about it, and he agreed. The highprinces will never stand for someone being put over them in war. Sadeas mentioned that if I started with something less threatening, like appointing someone to Highprince of Information, it might prepare the others for what you want to do.\u201D\r\n\u201CSadeas suggested this,\u201D Dalinar said flatly.\r\n\u201COf course,\u201D Elhokar said. \u201CIt is time we had a Highprince of Information, and he specifically noted the cut girth as something he wanted to look into. He knows you\u2019ve always said you aren\u2019t suited to these sorts of things.\u201D\r\nBlood of my fathers,Dalinar thought, looking out at the center of the island, where a group of lighteyes gathered around Sadeas.\r\nI\u2019ve just been outmaneuvered. Brilliantly.\r\nThe Highprince of Information had authority over criminal investigations, particularly those of interest to the Crown. In a way, it was nearly as threatening as a Highprince of War, but it wouldn\u2019t seem so to Elhokar. All he saw was that he would finally have someone willing to listen to his paranoid fears.\r\nSadeas was a clever, clever man.\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t look so morose, Uncle,\u201D Elhokar said. \u201CI had no idea you\u2019d want the position, and Sadeas just seemed so excited at the idea. Perhaps he\u2019ll find nothing at all, and the leather was simply worn out. You\u2019ll be vindicated in always telling me that I\u2019m not in as much danger as I think I am.\u201D\r\n\u201CVindicated?\u201D Dalinar asked softly, still watching Sadeas.\r\nSomehow, I doubt that is likely."

      "ChapterName": "23: MANY USES",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\nYou have accused me of arrogance in my quest. You have accused me of perpetuating my grudge against Rayse and Bavadin. Both accusations are true.\r\nKaladin stood up in the wagon bed, scanning the landscape outside the camp as Rock and Teft put his plan\u2014such as it was\u2014into action.\r\nBack home, the air had been drier. If you went about on the day before a highstorm, everything seemed desolate. After storms, plants soon pulled back into their shells, trunks, and hiding places to conserve water. But here in the moister climate, they lingered. Many rockbuds never quite pulled into their shells completely. Patches of grass were common. The trees Sadeas harvested were concentrated in a forest to the north of the warcamps, but a few strays grew on this plain. They were enormous, broad-trunked things that grew with a westward slant, their thick, finger like roots clawing into the stone and\u2014over the years\u2014cracking and breaking the ground around them.\r\nKaladin hopped down from the cart. His job was to hoist up stones and place them on the bed of the vehicle. The other bridgemen brought them to him, laying them in heaps nearby.\r\nBridgemen worked across the broad plain, moving among rockbuds, patches of grass, and bunches of weeds that poked out from beneath boulders. Those grew most heavily on the west side, ready to pull back into their boulder\u2019s shadow if a highstorm approached. It was a curious effect, as if each boulder were the head of an aged man with tufts of green and brown hair growing out from behind his ears.\r\nThose tufts were extremely important, for hidden among them were thin reeds known as knobweed. Their rigid stalks were topped with delicate fronds that could retract into the stem. The stems themselves were immobile, but they were fairly safe growing behind boulders. Some would be pulled free in each storm\u2014perhaps to attach themselves in a new location once the winds abated.\r\nKaladin hoisted a rock, setting it on the bed of the wagon and rolling it beside some others. The rock\u2019s bottom was wet with lichen and crem.\r\nKnobweed wasn\u2019t rare, but neither was it as common as other weeds. A quick description had been enough to send Rock and Teft searching with some success. The breakthrough, however, had happened when Syl had joined the hunt. Kaladin glanced to the side as he stepped down for another stone. She zipped around, a faint, nearly invisible form leading Rock from one stand of reeds to another. Teft didn\u2019t understand how the large Horn eater could consistently find so many more than he did, but Kaladin didn\u2019t feel inclined to explain. He still didn\u2019t understand why Rock could see Syl in the first place. The Horneater said it was something he\u2019d been born with.\r\nA pair of bridgemen approached, youthful Dunny and Earless Jaks towing a wooden sled bearing a large stone. Sweat trickled down the sides of their faces. As they reached the wagon, Kaladin dusted off his hands and helped them lift the boulder. Earless Jaks scowled at him, muttering under his breath.\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s a nice one,\u201D Kaladin said, nodding to the stone. \u201CGood work.\u201D\r\nJaks glared at him and stalked off. Dunny gave Kaladin a shrug, then hurried after the older man. As Rock had guessed, getting the crew assigned to stone-gathering duty had not helped Kaladin\u2019s popularity. But it had to be done. It was the only way to help Leyten and the other wounded.\r\nOnce Jaks and Dunny left, Kaladin nonchalantly climbed into the wagon bed and knelt down, pushing aside a tarp and uncovering a large pile of knobweed stems. They were about as long as a man\u2019s forearm. He made as if he were moving stones around in the bed, but instead tied a large double handful of the reeds into a bundle using thin rockbud vines.\r\nHe dropped the bundle over the side of the wagon. The wagon driver had gone to chat with his counterpart on the other wagon. That left Kaladin alone, save for the chull that sat hunkered down in its rock shell, watching the sun with beady crustacean eyes.\r\nKaladin hopped down from the wagon and placed another rock in the bed. Then, he knelt as if to pull a large stone out from under the wagon. With deft hands, however, he tied the reeds into place underneath the bed right beside two other bundles. The wagon had a large open space to the side of the axle, and a wood dowel there provided an excellent place for mounting the bundles.\r\nJezerezeh send that nobody thinks to check the bottom as we roll back into camp.\r\nThe apothecary said one drop came per stem. How many reeds would Kaladin need? He felt he knew the answer to that question without even giving it much thought.\r\nHe\u2019d need every drop he could get.\r\nHe climbed out and lifted another stone into the wagon. Rock was approaching; the large, tan-skinned Horneater carried an oblong stone that would have been too large for most of the bridgemen to handle alone. Rock shuffled forward slowly, Syl zipping around his head and occasionally landing on the rock to watch him.\r\nKaladin climbed down and trotted across the uneven ground to help. Rock nodded in thanks. Together they hauled the stone to the wagon and set it down on the bed. Rock wiped his brow, turning his back to Kaladin. Sprouting from his pocket was a handful of reeds. Kaladin swiped them and tucked them beneath the tarp.\r\n\u201CWhat do we do if someone notices this thing we are doing?\u201D Rock asked casually.\r\n\u201CExplain that I\u2019m a weaver,\u201D Kaladin said, \u201Cand that I thought I\u2019d weave myself a hat to keep off the sun.\u201D\r\nRock snorted.\r\n\u201CI might do just that,\u201D Kaladin said. He wiped his brow. \u201CIt would be nice in this heat. But best nobody sees. The mere fact that we want the reeds would probably be enough to make them deny them to us.\u201D\r\n\u201CThis thing is true,\u201D Rock said, stretching and glancing upward as Syl zipped over in front of him. \u201CI miss the Peaks.\u201D\r\nSyl pointed, and Rock bowed his head in reverence before following after her. Once she had him going in the right direction, however, she flitted back to Kaladin, bobbing up into the air as a ribbon, then falling down to the side of the wagon and reforming her womanly shape, her dress fluttering around her.\r\n\u201CI,\u201D she declared, raising a finger, \u201Clike him very much.\u201D\r\n\u201CWho? Rock?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D she said, folding her arms. \u201CHe is\r\nrespectful. Unlike others.\u201D\r\n\u201CFine,\u201D Kaladin said, lifting another stone into the wagon. \u201CYou can follow him around instead of bothering me.\u201D He tried not to show worry as he said it. He had grown accustomed to her company.\r\nShe sniffed. \u201CI can\u2019t follow him. He\u2019s too respectful.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou just said you\r\nlikedthat.\u201D\r\n\u201CI do. Also, I detest it.\u201D She said that with unaffected frankness, as if oblivious of the contradiction. She sighed, sitting down on the side of the wagon. \u201CI led him to a patch of chull dung as a prank. He didn\u2019t even yell at me! He just looked at it, as if trying to figure out some hidden meaning.\u201D She grimaced. \u201CThat\u2019s not normal.\u201D\r\n\u201CI think the Horneaters must worship spren or something,\u201D Kaladin said, wiping his brow.\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s silly.\u201D\r\n\u201CPeople believe much sillier things. In some ways, I guess it makes sense to revere the spren. You\r\narekind of odd and magical.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m not odd!\u201D she said, standing up. \u201CI\u2019m beautiful and articulate.\u201D She planted her hands on her hips, but he could see in her expression that she wasn\u2019t really mad. She seemed to be changing by the hour, growing more and more\u2026\r\nMore and more what? Not exactly humanlike. More individual. Smarter.\r\nSyl fell silent as another bridgeman\u2014Natam\u2014approached. The long-faced man was carrying a smaller stone, obviously trying not to strain himself.\r\n\u201CHo, Natam,\u201D Kaladin said, reaching down to take the stone. \u201CHow goes the work?\u201D\r\nNatam shrugged.\r\n\u201CDidn\u2019t you say you were once a farmer?\u201D\r\nNatam rested beside the wagon, ignoring Kaladin.\r\nKaladin set down the rock, moving it into place. \u201CI\u2019m sorry to make us work like this, but we need the good will of Gaz and the other bridge crews.\u201D\r\nNatam didn\u2019t respond.\r\n\u201CIt will help keep us alive,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CTrust me.\u201D\r\nNatam just shrugged yet again, then wandered away.\r\nKaladin sighed. \u201CThis would be a lot easier if I could pin the duty change on Gaz.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat wouldn\u2019t be very honest,\u201D Syl said, affronted.\r\n\u201CWhy do you care so much about honesty?\u201D\r\n\u201CI just do.\u201D\r\n\u201COh?\u201D Kaladin said, grunting as he moved back to his work. \u201CAnd leading men to piles of dung? How honest is that?\u201D\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s different. It was a joke.\u201D\r\n\u201CI fail to see how\u2026\u201D\r\nHe trailed off as another bridgeman approached. Kaladin doubted anyone else had Rock\u2019s strange ability to see Syl, and didn\u2019t want to be seen talking to himself.\r\nThe short, wiry bridgeman had said his name was Skar, though Kaladin couldn\u2019t see any obvious scars on his face. He had short dark hair and angular features. Kaladin tried to engage him in conversation too, but got no response. The man even went so far as to give Kaladin a rude gesture before tromping back out.\r\n\u201CI\u2019m doing something wrong,\u201D Kaladin said, shaking his head and hopping down from the sturdy wagon.\r\n\u201CWrong?\u201D Syl stepped up to the lip of the wagon, watching him.\r\n\u201CI thought that seeing me rescue those three might give them hope. But they\u2019re still indifferent.\u201D\r\n\u201CSome watched you run earlier,\u201D Syl said, \u201Cwhen you were practicing with the plank.\u201D\r\n\u201CThey watched,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CBut they don\u2019t care about helping the wounded. Nobody besides Rock, that is\u2014and he\u2019s only doing it because he has a debt to me. Even Teft wasn\u2019t willing to share his food.\u201D\r\n\u201CThey\u2019re selfish.\u201D\r\n\u201CNo. I don\u2019t think that word can apply to them.\u201D He lifted a stone, struggling to explain how he felt. \u201CWhen I was a slave\u2026well, I\u2019m still\u00A0a\u00A0slave. But during the worst parts, when my masters were trying to beat out of me the ability to resist, I was like these men. I didn\u2019t care enough to be selfish. I was like an animal. I just did what I did without thinking.\u201D\r\nSyl frowned. Little wonder\u2014Kaladin himself didn\u2019t understand what he was saying. Yet, as he spoke, he began to work out what he meant. \u201CI\u2019ve shown them that we can survive, but that doesn\u2019t mean anything. If those lives aren\u2019t\r\nworthliving, then they aren\u2019t ever going to care. It\u2019s like I\u2019m offering them piles of spheres, but not giving them anything to spend their wealth on.\u201D\r\n\u201CI guess,\u201D Syl said. \u201CBut what can you do?\u201D\r\nHe looked back across the plain of rock, toward the warcamp. The smoke of the army\u2019s many cookfires rose from the craters. \u201CI don\u2019t know. But I think we\u2019re going to need a\r\nlotmore reeds.\u201D\r\nThat night, Kaladin, Teft, and Rock walked the makeshift streets of Sadeas\u2019s warcamp. Nomon\u2014the middle moon\u2014shone with his pale, blue-white light. Oil lanterns hung in front of buildings, indicating taverns or brothels. Spheres could provide more consistent, renewable light, but you could buy a bundle of candles or a pouch of oil for a single sphere. In the short run, it was often cheaper to do that, particularly if you were hanging your lights in a place they could be stolen.\r\nSadeas didn\u2019t enforce a curfew, but Kaladin had learned that a lone bridgeman had best remain in the lumberyard at night. Half-drunken soldiers in stained uniforms sauntered past, whispering in the ears of whores or boasting to their friends. They called insults at the bridgemen, laughing riotously. The streets felt dark, even with the lanterns and the moonlight, and the haphazard nature of the camp\u2014some stone structures, some wooden shanties, some tents\u2014made it feel disorganized and dangerous.\r\nKaladin and his two companions stepped aside for a large group of soldiers. Their coats were unbuttoned, and they were only mildly drunk. A soldier eyed the bridgemen, but the three of them together\u2014one of them being a brawny Horneater\u2014were enough to dissuade the soldier from doing more than laughing and shoving Kaladin as he passed.\r\nThe man smelled of sweat and cheap ale. Kaladin kept his temper. Fight back, and he\u2019d be docked pay for brawling.\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t like this,\u201D Teft said, glancing over his shoulder at the group of soldiers. \u201CI\u2019m going back to the camp.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou will be staying,\u201D Rock growled.\r\nTeft rolled his eyes. \u201CYou think I\u2019m scared of a lumbering chull like you? I\u2019ll go if I want to, and\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CTeft,\u201D Kaladin said softly. \u201CWe need you.\u201D\r\nNeed. That word had strange effects on men. Some ran when you used it. Others grew nervous. Teft seemed to long for it. He nodded, muttering to himself, but stayed with them as they went on.\r\nThey soon reached the wagonyard. The fenced-off square of rock was near the western side of the camp. It was deserted for the night, the wagons sitting in long lines. Chulls lay slumbering in the nearby pen, looking like small hills. Kaladin crept forward, wary of sentries, but apparently nobody worried about something as large as a wagon being stolen from the middle of the army.\r\nRock nudged him, then pointed to the shadowy chull pens. A lone boy sat upon a pen post, staring up at the moon. Chulls were valuable enough to watch over. Poor lad. How often was he required to wait up nights guarding the sluggish beasts?\r\nKaladin crouched down beside a wagon, the other two mimicking him. He pointed down one row, and Rock moved off. Kaladin pointed the other direction, and Teft rolled his eyes, but did as asked.\r\nKaladin sneaked down the middle row. There were about thirty wagons, ten per row, but checking was quick. A brush of the fingers against the back plank, looking for the mark he\u2019d made there. After just a few minutes, a shadowed figure entered Kaladin\u2019s row. Rock. The Horneater gestured to the side and held up five fingers. Fifth wagon from the top. Kaladin nodded and moved off.\r\nJust as he reached the indicated wagon, he heard a soft yelp from the direction Teft had gone. Kaladin flinched, then peeked up toward the sentry. The boy was still watching the moon, kicking his toes absently against the post next to him.\r\nA moment later, Rock and a sheepish Teft scurried up to Kaladin. \u201CSorry,\u201D Teft whispered. \u201CThe walking mountain startled me.\u201D\r\n\u201CIf I am being a mountain,\u201D Rock grumbled, \u201Cthen why weren\u2019t you hearing me coming? Eh?\u201D\r\nKaladin snorted, feeling the back of the indicated wagon, fingers brushing the X mark in the wood. He took a breath, then climbed under the wagon on his back.\r\nThe reeds were still there, tied in twenty bundles, each about as thick as a handspan. \u201CIshi, Herald of Luck be praised,\u201D he whispered, untying the first bundle.\r\n\u201CAll there, eh?\u201D Teft said, leaning down, scratching at his beard in the moonlight. \u201CCan\u2019t believe we found so many. Must have pulled up every reed on the entire plain.\u201D\r\nKaladin handed him the first bundle. Without Syl, they wouldn\u2019t have found a third this many. She had the speed of an insect in flight, and she seemed to have a sense of where to find things. Kaladin untied the next bundle, handing it out. Teft tied it to the other, making a larger bundle.\r\nAs Kaladin worked, a flurry of small white leaves blew under the wagon and formed into Syl\u2019s figure. She slid to a stop beside his head. \u201CNo\u00A0guards anywhere I could see. Just a boy in the chull pens.\u201D Her white-blue translucent figure was nearly invisible in the darkness.\r\n\u201CI hope these reeds are still good,\u201D Kaladin whispered. \u201CIf they dried out too much\u2026\u201D\r\n\u201CThey\u2019ll be fine. You worry like a worrier. I found you some bottles.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou did?\u201D he asked, so eager that he nearly sat up. He caught himself before smacking his head.\r\nSyl nodded. \u201CI\u2019ll show you. I couldn\u2019t carry them. Too solid.\u201D\r\nKaladin quickly untied the rest of the bundles, handing them out to the nervous Teft. Kaladin scooted out, then took two of the larger, tied-together bundles of three. Teft took two of the others, and Rock managed three by tucking one under his arm. They\u2019d need a place to work where they wouldn\u2019t be interrupted. Even if the knobweed seemed worthless, Gaz would find a way to ruin the work if he saw what was happening.\r\nBottle first,Kaladin thought. He nodded to Syl, who led them out of the wagonyard and to a tavern. It looked to have been hastily built from second-rate lumber, but that didn\u2019t stop the soldiers inside from enjoying themselves. Their rowdiness made Kaladin worry about the entire building collapsing.\r\nBehind it, in a splintery half-crate, lay a pile of discarded liquor bottles. Glass was precious enough that whole bottles would be reused, but these had cracks or broken tops. Kaladin set down his bundles, then selected three nearly whole bottles. He washed them in a nearby water barrel before tucking them into a sack he\u2019d brought for the purpose.\r\nHe picked up his bundles again, nodding to the others. \u201CTry to look like you\u2019re doing something monotonous,\u201D he said. \u201CBow your heads.\u201D The other two nodded, and they walked out into a main road, carrying the bundles as if on some work detail. They drew far less attention than they had before.\r\nThey avoided the lumberyard proper, crossing the open field of rock used as the army\u2019s staging area before walking down the slope of rock leading to the Shattered Plains. A sentry saw them, and Kaladin held his breath, but he said nothing. He probably assumed from their postures that they had a reason to be doing what they were. If they tried to leave the warcamp, it would be a different story, but this section down near the first few chasms wasn\u2019t off limits.\r\nBefore long, they approached the place where Kaladin had nearly killed himself. What a difference a few days could make. He felt like a different person\u2014a strange hybrid of the man he had once been, the slave he\u2019d become, and the pitiful wretch he still had to fight off. He remembered standing on the edge of the chasm, looking down. That darkness still terrified him.\r\nIf I fail to save the bridgemen, that wretch will take control again. This time he\u2019ll get his way\u2026.That gave Kaladin a shiver. He set his bundles down beside the chasm ledge, then sat. The other two followed more hesitantly.\r\n\u201CWe\u2019re going to toss them into the chasm?\u201D Teft asked, scratching his beard. \u201CAfter all that work?\u201D\r\n\u201COf course not,\u201D Kaladin said. He hesitated; Nomon was bright, but it was still night. \u201CYou don\u2019t have any spheres, do you?\u201D\r\n\u201CWhy?\u201D Teft asked, suspicious.\r\n\u201CFor light, Teft.\u201D\r\nTeft grumbled, pulling out a handful of garnet chips. \u201CWas going to spend these tonight\u2026.\u201D he said. They glowed in his palm.\r\n\u201CAll right,\u201D Kaladin said, slipping out a reed. What had his father said about these? Hesitantly, Kaladin broke off the furry top of the reed, exposing the hollow center. He took the reed by the other end and ran his fingers down its length, squeezing it tight. Two drops of milky white liquid dripped into the empty liquor bottle.\r\nKaladin smiled in satisfaction, then squeezed his fingers along the length again. Nothing came out this time, so he tossed the reed into the chasm. For all his talk of hats, he didn\u2019t want to leave evidence.\r\n\u201CI thought you said we aren\u2019t throwing them in!\u201D Teft accused.\r\nKaladin held up the liquor bottle. \u201COnly after we have this out.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat is it?\u201D Rock leaned closer, squinting.\r\n\u201CKnobweed sap. Or, rather, knobweed milk\u2014I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really sap. Anyway, it\u2019s a powerful antiseptic.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnti\u2026what?\u201D Teft asked.\r\n\u201CIt scares away rotspren,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CThey cause infection. This milk is one of the best antiseptics there is. Spread it on a wound that\u2019s already infected, and it will still work.\u201D That was good, because Leyten\u2019s wounds had begun to turn an angry red, rotspren crawling all over.\r\nTeft grunted, then glanced at the bundles. \u201CThere are a lot of reeds here.\u201D\r\n\u201CI know,\u201D Kaladin said, handing over the other two bottles. \u201CThat\u2019s why I\u2019m glad I don\u2019t have to milk them all on my own.\u201D\r\nTeft sighed, but sat down and untied a bundle. Rock did so without the complaining, sitting with his knees bent to the sides, feet pressed together to hold the bottle as he worked.\r\nA faint breeze blew up, rattling some of the reeds. \u201CWhy do you care about them?\u201D Teft finally asked.\r\n\u201CThey\u2019re my men.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s not what being bridgeleader means.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt means whatever we decide,\u201D Kaladin said, noting that Syl had come over to listen. \u201CYou, me, the others.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou think they\u2019ll let you do that?\u201D Teft asked. \u201CThe lighteyes and the captains?\u201D\r\n\u201CYou think they\u2019ll pay enough attention to even notice?\u201D\r\nTeft hesitated, then grunted, milking another reed.\r\n\u201CPerhaps they will,\u201D Rock said. There was a surprising level of delicacy to the large man\u2019s motions as he milked the reeds. Kaladin hadn\u2019t thought those thick fingers would be so careful, so precise. \u201CLighteyes, they are often noticing those things that you wish they would not.\u201D\r\nTeft grunted again, agreeing.\r\n\u201CHow did you come here, Rock?\u201D Kaladin asked. \u201CHow does a Horneater end up leaving his mountains and coming to the lowlands?\u201D\r\n\u201CYou shouldn\u2019t ask those kinds of things, son,\u201D Teft said, wagging a finger at Kaladin. \u201CWe don\u2019t talk about our pasts.\u201D\r\n\u201CWe don\u2019t talk about\r\nanything,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CYou two didn\u2019t even know each other\u2019s names.\u201D\r\n\u201CNames are one thing,\u201D Teft grumbled. \u201CBackgrounds, they\u2019re different. I\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CIs all right,\u201D Rock said. \u201CI will speak of this thing.\u201D\r\nTeft muttered to himself, but he did lean forward to listen when Rock spoke.\r\n\u201CMy people have no Shardblades,\u201D Rock said in his low, rumbling voice.\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s not unusual,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201COther than Alethkar and Jah Keved, few kingdoms have many Blades.\u201D It was a matter of some pride among the armies.\r\n\u201CThis thing is not true,\u201D Rock said. \u201CThaylenah has five Blades and three full suits of Plate, all held by the royal guards. The Selay have their share of both suits and Blades. Other kingdoms, such as Herdaz, have a single Blade and set of Plate\u2014this is passed down through the royal line. But the Unkalaki, we have not a single Shard. Many of our\r\nnuatoma\u2014this thing, it is the same as your lighteyes, only their eyes are not light\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CHow can you be a lighteyes without light eyes?\u201D Teft said with a scowl.\r\n\u201CBy having dark eyes,\u201D Rock said, as if it were obvious. \u201CWe do not pick our leaders this way. Is complicated. But do not interrupt story.\u201D He milked another reed, tossing the husk into a pile beside him. \u201CThe\r\nnuatoma, they see our lack of Shards as great shame. They want these weapons very badly. It is believed that the\r\nnuatomawho first obtains a Shardblade would become king, a thing we have not had for many years. No peak would fight another peak where a man held one of the blessed Blades.\u201D\r\n\u201CSo you came to\r\nbuyone?\u201D Kaladin asked. No Shardbearer would sell his weapon. Each was a distinctive relic, taken from one of the Lost Radiants after their betrayal.\r\nRock laughed. \u201CHa! Buy? No, we are not so foolish as this. But my\r\nnuatoma, he knew of your tradition, eh? It says that if a man kills a Shardbearer, he may take the Blade and Plate as his own. And so my\r\nnuatomaand his house, we made a grand procession, coming down to find and kill one of your Shardbearers.\u201D\r\nKaladin almost laughed. \u201CI assume it proved more difficult than that.\u201D\r\n\u201CMy\r\nnuatomawas not a fool,\u201D Rock said, defensive. \u201CHe knew this thing would be difficult, but your tradition, it gives us hope, you see? Occasionally, a brave\r\nnuatomawill come down to duel a Shardbearer. Someday, one will win, and we will have Shards.\u201D\r\n\u201CPerhaps,\u201D Kaladin said, tossing an empty reed into the chasm. \u201CAssuming they agree to duel you in a bout to the death.\u201D\r\n\u201COh, they always duel,\u201D Rock said, laughing. \u201CThe\r\nnuatomabrings many riches and promises all of his possessions to the victor. Your lighteyes, they cannot pass by a pond so warm! To kill an Unkalaki with no Shardblade, they do not see this thing as difficult. Many\r\nnuatomahave died. But is all right. Eventually, we will win.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd have one set of Shards,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CAlethkar has dozens.\u201D\r\n\u201COne is a beginning,\u201D Rock said, shrugging. \u201CBut my\r\nnuatomalost, so I am bridgeman.\u201D\r\n\u201CWait,\u201D Teft said. \u201CYou came all of this way with your brightlord, and once he lost, you up and joined a bridge crew?\u201D\r\n\u201CNo, no, you do not see,\u201D Rock said. \u201CMy\r\nnuatoma,he challenged Highprince Sadeas. Is well known that there are many Shardbearers here on Shattered Plains. My\r\nnuatomathought it easier to fight man with only Plate first, then win Blade next.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd?\u201D Teft said.\r\n\u201COnce my\r\nnuatomalost to Brightlord Sadeas, all of us became his.\u201D\r\n\u201CSo you\u2019re a slave?\u201D Kaladin asked, reaching up and feeling the marks on his forehead.\r\n\u201CNo, we do not have this thing,\u201D Rock said. \u201CI was not a slave of my\r\nnuatoma. I was his family.\u201D\r\n\u201CHis\r\nfamily?\u201D Teft said. \u201CKelek! You\u2019re a lighteyes!\u201D\r\nRock laughed again, loud and full-bellied. Kaladin smiled despite himself. It seemed like so long since he\u2019d heard someone laugh like that. \u201CNo, no. I was only\r\numarti\u2019a\u2014his cousin, you would say.\u201D\r\n\u201CStill, you were related to him.\u201D\r\n\u201COn the Peaks,\u201D Rock said, \u201Cthe relatives of a brightlord are his servants.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat kind of system is that?\u201D Teft complained. \u201CYou have to be a servant to your own relatives? Storm me! I\u2019d rather die, I think I would.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt is not so bad,\u201D Rock said.\r\n\u201CYou don\u2019t know my relatives,\u201D Teft said, shivering.\r\nRock laughed again. \u201CYou would rather serve someone you do not know? Like this Sadeas? A man who is no relation to you?\u201D He shook his head. \u201CLowlanders. You have too much air here. Makes your minds sick.\u201D\r\n\u201CToo much air?\u201D Kaladin asked.\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D Rock said.\r\n\u201CHow can you have too much air? It\u2019s all around.\u201D\r\n\u201CThis thing, it is difficult to explain.\u201D Rock\u2019s Alethi was good, but he sometimes forget to add in common words. Other times, he remembered them, speaking his sentences precisely. The faster he spoke, the more words he forgot to put in.\r\n\u201CYou have too much air,\u201D Rock said. \u201CCome to the Peaks. You will see.\u201D\r\n\u201CI guess,\u201D Kaladin said, shooting a glance at Teft, who just shrugged. \u201CBut you\u2019re wrong about one thing. You said that we serve someone we don\u2019t know. Well, I\r\ndoknow Brightlord Sadeas. I know him well.\u201D\r\nRock raised an eyebrow.\r\n\u201CArrogant,\u201D Kaladin said, \u201Cvengeful, greedy, corrupt to the core.\u201D\r\nRock smiled. \u201CYes, I think you are right. This man is not among the finest of lighteyes.\u201D\r\n\u201CThere are no \u2018finest\u2019 among them, Rock. They\u2019re all the same.\u201D\r\n\u201CThey have done much to you, then?\u201D\r\nKaladin shrugged, the question uncovering wounds that weren\u2019t yet healed. \u201CAnyway, your master was lucky.\u201D\r\n\u201CLucky to be slain by a Shardbearer?\u201D\r\n\u201CLucky he didn\u2019t win,\u201D Kaladin said, \u201Cand discover how he\u2019d been tricked. They wouldn\u2019t have let him walk away with Sadeas\u2019s Plate.\u201D\r\n\u201CNonsense,\u201D Teft broke in. \u201CTradition\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CTradition is the blind witness they use to condemn us, Teft,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CIt\u2019s the pretty box they use to wrap up their lies. It makes us serve them.\u201D\r\nTeft set his jaw. \u201CI\u2019ve lived a lot longer than you, son. I know things. If a common man killed an enemy Shardbearer, he\u2019d become a lighteyes. That\u2019s the way of it.\u201D\r\nHe let the argument lapse. If Teft\u2019s illusions made him feel better about his place in this mess of a war, then who was Kaladin to dissuade him? \u201CSo you were a servant,\u201D Kaladin said to Rock. \u201CIn a brightlord\u2019s retinue? What kind of servant?\u201D He struggled for the right word, remembering back to the times he\u2019d interacted with Wistiow or Roshone. \u201CA footman? A butler?\u201D\r\nRock laughed. \u201CI was cook. My\r\nnuatomawould not come down to the lowlands without his own cook! Your food here, it has so many spices that you cannot taste anything else. Might as well be eating stones powdered with pepper!\u201D\r\n\u201C\r\nYoushould talk about food,\u201D Teft said, scowling. \u201CA Horneater?\u201D\r\nKaladin frowned. \u201CWhy do they call your people that, anyway?\u201D\r\n\u201CBecause they eat the horns and shells of the things they catch,\u201D Teft said. \u201CThe outsides.\u201D\r\nRock smiled, with a look of longing. \u201CAh, but the taste is so good.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou actually eat the shells?\u201D Kaladin asked.\r\n\u201CWe have very strong teeth,\u201D Rock said proudly. \u201CBut there. You now know my story. Brightlord Sadeas, he wasn\u2019t certain what he should do with most of us. Some were made soldiers, others serve in his house hold. I fixed him one meal and he sent me to bridge crews.\u201D Rock hesitated. \u201CI may have, uh, enhanced the soup.\u201D\r\n\u201CEnhanced?\u201D Kaladin asked, raising an eyebrow.\r\nRock seemed to grow embarrassed. \u201CYou see, I was quite angry about my\r\nnuatoma\u2019s death. And I thought, these lowlanders, their tongues are all scorched and burned by the food they eat. They have no taste, and\u2026\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd what?\u201D Kaladin asked.\r\n\u201CChull dung,\u201D Rock said. \u201CIt apparently has stronger taste than I assumed.\u201D\r\n\u201CWait,\u201D Teft said. \u201CYou put\r\nchull dungin Highprince Sadeas\u2019s soup?\u201D\r\n\u201CEr, yes,\u201D Rock said. \u201CActually, I put this thing in his bread too. And used it as a garnish on the pork steak. And made a chutney out of it for the buttered garams. Chull dung, it has many uses, I found.\u201D\r\nTeft laughed, his voice echoing. He fell on his side, so amused that Kaladin was afraid he\u2019d roll right into the chasm. \u201CHorneater,\u201D Teft finally said, \u201CI owe you a drink.\u201D\r\nRock smiled. Kaladin shook his head to himself, amazed. It suddenly made sense.\r\n\u201CWhat?\u201D Rock said, apparently noticing his expression.\r\n\u201CThis is what we need,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201C\r\nThis!It\u2019s the thing I\u2019ve been missing.\u201D\r\nRock hesitated. \u201CChull dung? This is the thing you need?\u201D\r\nTeft burst into another round of laugher.\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CIt\u2019s\u2026well, I\u2019ll show you. But first we need this knobweed sap.\u201D They\u2019d barely made their way through one of the bundles, and already his fingers were aching from the milking.\r\n\u201CWhat of you, Kaladin?\u201D Rock asked. \u201CI have been telling you my story. You will tell me yours? How did you come to those marks on your forehead?\u201D\r\n\u201CYeah,\u201D Teft said, wiping his eyes. \u201CWhose food did\r\nyoutrat in?\u201D\r\n\u201CI thought you said it was taboo to ask about a bridgeman\u2019s past,\u201D Kaladin said.\r\n\u201CYou made Rock share, son,\u201D Teft said. \u201CIt\u2019s only fair.\u201D\r\n\u201CSo if I tell my story, that means you\u2019ll tell yours?\u201D\r\nTeft scowled immediately. \u201CNow look, I ain\u2019t going to\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CI killed a man,\u201D Kaladin said.\r\nThat quieted Teft. Rock perked up. Syl, Kaladin noticed, was still watching with interest. That was odd for her; normally, her attention wavered quickly.\r\n\u201CYou killed a man?\u201D Rock said. \u201CAnd after this thing, they made you a slave? Is not the punishment for murder usually death?\u201D\r\n\u201CIt wasn\u2019t murder,\u201D Kaladin said softly, thinking of the scraggly bearded man in the slave wagon who had asked him these same questions. \u201CIn fact, I was thanked for it by someone very important.\u201D\r\nHe fell silent.\r\n\u201CAnd?\u201D Teft finally asked.\r\n\u201CAnd\u2026\u201D Kaladin said, looking down at a reed. Nomon was setting in the west, and the small green disk of Mishim\u2014the final moon\u2014was rising in the east. \u201CAnd it turns out that lighteyes don\u2019t react very well when you turn down their gifts.\u201D\r\nThe others waited for more, but Kaladin fell silent, working on his reeds. It shocked him, how painful it still was to remember those events back in Amaram\u2019s army.\r\nEither the others sensed his mood, or they felt what he\u2019d said was enough, for they each turned back to their work and prodded no further."

      "ChapterName": "24: THE GALLERY OF MAPS",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\nNeither point makes the things I have written to you here untrue.\r\nThe king\u2019s Gallery of Maps balanced beauty and function. The expansive domed structure of Soulcast stone had smooth sides that melded seamlessly with the rocky ground. It was shaped like a long loaf of Thaylen bread, and had large skylights in the ceiling, allowing the sun to shine down on handsome formations of shalebark.\r\nDalinar passed one of these, pinks and vibrant greens and blues growing in a gnarled pattern as high as his shoulders. The crusty, hard plants had no true stalks or leaves, just waving tendrils like colorful hair. Except for those, shalebark seemed more rock than vegetation. And yet, scholars said it must be a plant for the way it grew and reached toward the light.\r\nMen did that too,he thought.\r\nOnce.\r\nHighprince Roion stood in front of one of the maps, hands clasped behind his back, his numerous attendants clogging the other side of the gallery. Roion was a tall, light-skinned man with a dark, well-trimmed beard. He was thinning on top. Like most of the others, he wore a short, open-fronted jacket, exposing the shirt underneath. Its red fabric poked out above the jacket\u2019s collar.\r\nSo sloppy,Dalinar thought, though it was very fashionable. Dalinar just wished that current fashion weren\u2019t so, well, sloppy.\r\n\u201CBrightlord Dalinar,\u201D Roion said. \u201CI have difficulty seeing the point of this meeting.\u201D\r\n\u201CWalk with me, Brightlord Roion,\u201D Dalinar said, nodding to the side.\r\nThe other man sighed, but joined Dalinar and walked the pathway between the clusters of plants and the wall of maps. Roion\u2019s attendants followed; they included both a cupbearer and a shieldbearer.\r\nEach map was illuminated by diamonds, their enclosures made of mirror-polished steel. The maps were inked, in detail, onto unnaturally large, seamless sheets of parchment. Such parchment was obviously Soulcast. Near the center of the chamber they came to the Prime Map, an enormous, detailed map fixed in a frame on the wall. It showed the entirety of the Shattered Plains that had been explored. Permanent bridges were drawn in red, and plateaus close to the Alethi side had blue glyphpairs on them, indicating which highprince controlled them. The eastern section of the map grew less detailed until the lines vanished.\r\nIn the middle was the contested area, the section of plateaus where the\u00A0chasmfiends most often came to make their chrysalises. Few came to the near side, where the permanent bridges were. If they did come, it was to hunt, not to pupate.\r\nControlling the nearby plateaus was still important, as a highprince\u2014by agreement\u2014could not cross a plateau maintained by one of the others unless he had permission. That determined who had the best pathways to the central plateaus, and it also determined who had to maintain the watch-posts and permanent bridges on that plateau. Those plateaus were bought and sold among the highprinces.\r\nA second sheet of parchment to the side of the Prime Map listed each highprince and the number of gemhearts he had won. It was a very Alethi thing to do\u2014maintain motivation by making it very clear who was winning and who lagged behind.\r\nRoion\u2019s eyes immediately went to his own name on the list. Of all the highprinces, Roion had won the fewest gemhearts.\r\nDalinar reached his hand up to the Prime Map, brushing the parchment. The middle plateaus were named or numbered for ease of reference. Foremost of them was a large plateau that stood defiantly near the Parshendi side. The Tower, it was called. An unusually massive and oddly shaped plateau that the chasmfiends seemed particularly fond of using as a spot for pupating.\r\nLooking at it gave him pause. The size of a contested plateau determined the number of troops you could field on it. The Parshendi usually brought a large force to the Tower, and they had rebuffed the Alethi assaults there twenty-seven times now. No Alethi had ever won a skirmish upon it. Dalinar had been turned back there twice himself.\r\nIt was just too close to the Parshendi; they could always get there first and form up, using the slope to give them excellent high ground.\r\nBut if we could corner them there,he thought,\r\nwith a large enough force of our own\u2026It could mean trapping and killing a huge number of Parshendi troops. Maybe enough of them to break their ability to wage war on the Plains.\r\nIt was something to consider. Before that could happen, however, Dalinar would need alliances. He ran his fingers westward. \u201CHighprince Sadeas has been doing very well lately.\u201D Dalinar tapped Sadeas\u2019s warcamp. \u201CHe\u2019s been buying plateaus from other highprinces, making it easier and easier for him to get to the battlefields first.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D Roion said, frowning. \u201COne hardly needs to see a map to know that, Dalinar.\u201D\r\n\u201CLook at the scope of it,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CSix years of continuous fighting, and nobody has even\r\nseenthe center of the Shattered Plains.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s never been the point. We hold them in, besiege them, starve them out, and force them to come to us. Wasn\u2019t that\r\nyourplan?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes, but I never imagined it would take this long. I\u2019ve been thinking that it might be time to change tactics.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhy? This one works. Hardly a week goes by without a couple of clashes with the Parshendi. Though, might I point out that\r\nyouhave hardly been a model of inspiration in battle lately.\u201D He nodded to Dalinar\u2019s name on the smaller sheet.\r\nThere were a good number of scratches next to his name, noting gemhearts won. But very few of them were fresh.\r\n\u201CThere are some who say the Blackthorn has lost his sting,\u201D Roion said. He was careful not to insult Dalinar outright, but he went further than he once would have. News of Dalinar\u2019s actions while trapped in the barrack had spread.\r\nDalinar forced himself to be calm. \u201CRoion, we cannot continue to treat this war as a game.\u201D\r\n\u201CAll wars are games. The greatest kind, with the pieces lost real lives, the prizes captured making for real wealth! This is the life for which men exist. To fight, to kill, to win.\u201D He was quoting the Sunmaker, the last Alethi king to unite the highprinces. Gavilar had once revered his name.\r\n\u201CPerhaps,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CYet what is the point? We fight to get Shardblades, then use those Shardblades to fight to get more Shardblades. It\u2019s a circle, round and round we go, chasing our tails so we can be better at chasing our tails.\u201D\r\n\u201CWe fight to prepare ourselves to reclaim heaven and take back what is ours.\u201D\r\n\u201CMen can train without going to war, and men can fight without it being meaningless. It wasn\u2019t always this way. There were times when our wars\r\nmeantsomething.\u201D\r\nRoion raised an eyebrow. \u201CYou\u2019re almost making me believe the rumors, Dalinar. They say you\u2019ve lost your taste for combat, that you no longer have the will to fight.\u201D He eyed Dalinar again. \u201CSome are saying that it is time to abdicate in favor of your son.\u201D\r\n\u201CThe rumors are wrong,\u201D Dalinar snapped.\r\n\u201CThat is\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CThey are\r\nwrong,\u201D Dalinar said firmly, \u201Cif they claim that I no longer care.\u201D He rested his fingers on the surface of the map again, running them across the smooth parchment. \u201CI care, Roion. I care deeply. About this people. About my nephew. About the future of this war. And that is why I suggest we pursue an aggressive course from now on.\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, that is good to hear, I suppose.\u201D\r\nUnite them\u2026.\r\n\u201CI want you to try a joint plateau assault with me,\u201D Dalinar said.\r\n\u201CWhat?\u201D\r\n\u201CI want the two of us to try coordinating our efforts and attack at the same time, working together.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhy would we want to do that?\u201D\r\n\u201CWe could increase our chances of winning gemhearts.\u201D\r\n\u201CIf more troops increased my chances of winning,\u201D Roion said, \u201Cthen I\u2019d just bring more of my own. The plateaus are too small for fielding large armies, and mobility is more important than sheer numbers.\u201D\r\nIt was a valid point; on the Plains, more didn\u2019t necessarily mean better. Close confines and a requisite forced march to the battlefield changed warfare significantly. The exact number of troops used depended on the size of the plateau and the highprince\u2019s personal martial philosophy.\r\n\u201CWorking together wouldn\u2019t just be about fielding more troops,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CEach highprince\u2019s army has different strengths. I\u2019m known for my heavy infantry; you have the best archers. Sadeas\u2019s bridges are the fastest. Working together, we could try new tactics. We expend too much effort getting to the plateau in haste. If we weren\u2019t so rushed, competing against one another, maybe we could surround the plateau. We could try letting the Parshendi arrive first, then assault them on\r\nourterms, not theirs.\u201D\r\nRoion hesitated. Dalinar had spent days deliberating with his generals about the possibility of a joint assault. It seemed that there would be distinct advantages, but they wouldn\u2019t know for certain until someone tried it with him.\r\nHe actually seemed to be considering. \u201CWho would get the gemheart?\u201D\r\n\u201CWe split the wealth equally,\u201D Dalinar said.\r\n\u201CAnd if we capture a Shardblade?\u201D\r\n\u201CThe man who won it would get it, obviously.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd that\u2019s most likely to be you,\u201D Roion said, frowning. \u201CAs you and your son already have Shards.\u201D\r\nIt was the great problem of Shardblades and Shardplate\u2014winning either was highly unlikely unless you already had Shards yourself. In fact, having only one or the other often wasn\u2019t enough. Sadeas had faced Parshendi Shardbearers on the field, and had always been forced to retreat, lest he be\u00A0slain himself.\r\n\u201CI\u2019m certain we could arrange something more equitable,\u201D Dalinar finally said. If he won Shards, he\u2019d been hoping to be able to give them to Renarin.\r\n\u201CI\u2019m sure,\u201D Roion said skeptically.\r\nDalinar drew in a breath. He needed to be bolder. \u201CWhat if I offer them to you?\u201D\r\n\u201CExcuse me?\u201D\r\n\u201CWe try a joint attack. If I win a Shardblade or Plate, you get the first set. But I keep the second.\u201D\r\nRoion\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201CYou\u2019d do that?\u201D\r\n\u201COn my honor, Roion.\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, nobody would doubt that. But can you blame a man for being wary?\u201D\r\n\u201COf what?\u201D\r\n\u201CI am a highprince, Dalinar,\u201D Roion said. \u201CMy princedom is the smallest, true, but I am my own man. I would not see myself subordinated to someone greater.\u201D\r\nYou\u2019ve already become part of something greater,Dalinar thought with frustration.\r\nThat happened the moment you swore fealty to Gavilar.Roion and the others refused to make good on their promises. \u201COur kingdom can be so much more than it is, Roion.\u201D\r\n\u201CPerhaps. But perhaps I\u2019m satisfied with what I have. Either way, you make an interesting proposal. I shall have to think on it further.\u201D\r\n\u201CVery well,\u201D Dalinar said, but his instinct said that Roion would decline the offer. The man was too suspicious. The highprinces barely trusted one another enough to work together when there\r\nweren\u2019tShardblades and gems at stake.\r\n\u201CWill I be seeing you at the feast this evening?\u201D Roion asked.\r\n\u201CWhy wouldn\u2019t you?\u201D Dalinar asked with a sigh.\r\n\u201CWell, the stormwardens have been saying that there\r\ncouldbe a highstorm tonight, you see\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CI will be there,\u201D Dalinar said flatly.\r\n\u201CYes, of course,\u201D Roion said, chuckling. \u201CNo reason why you wouldn\u2019t be.\u201D He smiled at Dalinar and withdrew, his attendants following.\r\nDalinar sighed, turning to study the Prime Map, thinking through the meeting and what it meant. He stood there for a long time. Looking down on the Plains, as if a god far above. The plateaus looked like close islands, or perhaps jagged pieces set in a massive stained-glass window. Not for the first time, he felt as if he should be able to make out a pattern to the plateaus. If he could see more of them, perhaps. What would it mean if there\r\nwasan order to the chasms?\r\nEveryone else was so concerned with looking strong, with proving themselves. Was he really the only one who saw how frivolous that was? Strength for strength\u2019s sake? What good was strength unless you did something with it?\r\nAlethkar was a light, once,he thought.\r\nThat\u2019s what Gavilar\u2019s book claims, that\u2019s what the visions are showing me. Nohadon was king of Alethkar, so long ago. In the time before the Heralds left.\r\nDalinar felt as if he could almost see it. The secret. The thing that had made Gavilar so excited in the months before his death. If Dalinar could just stretch a little farther, he\u2019d make it out. See the pattern in the lives of men. And finally know.\r\nBut that was what he\u2019d been doing for the last six years. Grasping, stretching, reaching just a little farther. The farther he reached, the more distant those answers seemed to become.\r\nAdolin stepped into the Gallery of Maps. His father was still there, standing alone. Two members of the Cobalt Guard watched over him from a distance. Roion was nowhere to be seen.\r\nAdolin approached slowly. His father had that look in his eyes, the absent one he got so often lately. Even when he wasn\u2019t having an episode, he wasn\u2019t entirely here. Not in the way he once had been.\r\n\u201CFather?\u201D Adolin said, stepping up to him.\r\n\u201CHello, Adolin.\u201D\r\n\u201CHow was the meeting with Roion?\u201D Adolin asked, trying to sound cheerful.\r\n\u201CDisappointing. I\u2019m proving far worse at diplomacy than I once was at war-making.\u201D\r\n\u201CThere\u2019s no profit in peace.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s what everyone says. But we had peace once, and seemed to do just fine. Better, even.\u201D\r\n\u201CThere hasn\u2019t been peace since the Tranquiline Halls,\u201D Adolin said immediately. \u201C\u2018Man\u2019s life on Roshar is conflict.\u2019\u201D It was a quotation from\r\nThe Arguments.\r\nDalinar turned to Adolin, looking amused. \u201CQuoting scripture at me? You?\u201D\r\nAdolin shrugged, feeling foolish. \u201CWell, you see, Malasha is rather religious, and so earlier today I was listening to\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CWait,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CMalasha? Who\u2019s that?\u201D\r\n\u201CDaughter of Brightlord Seveks.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd that other girl, Janala?\u201D\r\nAdolin grimaced, thinking back to the disastrous walk they\u2019d gone on the other day. Several nice gifts had yet to repair that. She didn\u2019t seem half as excited about him now that he wasn\u2019t courting someone else. \u201CThings are rocky. Malasha seems like a better prospect.\u201D He moved on quickly. \u201CI take it that Roion won\u2019t soon be going on any plateau assault with us.\u201D\r\nDalinar shook his head. \u201CHe\u2019s too afraid that I\u2019m trying to maneuver him into a position where I can seize his lands. Perhaps it was wrong to approach the weakest highprince first. He\u2019d rather hunker down and try to weather what comes at him, holding what he has, as opposed to making a risky play for something greater.\u201D\r\nDalinar stared at the map, looking distant again. \u201CGavilar dreamed of unifying Alethkar. Once I thought he\u2019d achieved it, despite what he claimed. The longer I work with these men, the more I realize that Gavilar was right. We failed. We defeated these men, but we\r\nneverunified them.\u201D\r\n\u201CSo you still intend to approach the others?\u201D\r\n\u201CI do. I only need one to say yes in order to start. Who do you think we should go to next?\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m not sure,\u201D Adolin said. \u201CBut for now, I think you should know something. Sadeas has sent to us, asking permission to enter our warcamp. He wants to interview the grooms who cared for His Majesty\u2019s horse during the hunt.\u201D\r\n\u201CHis new position gives him the right to make those kinds of demands.\u201D\r\n\u201CFather,\u201D Adolin said, stepping closer, speaking softly. \u201CI think he\u2019s going to move against us.\u201D\r\nDalinar looked at him.\r\n\u201CI know you trust him,\u201D Adolin said quickly. \u201CAnd I understand your reasons now. But\r\nlistento me. This move puts him in an ideal position to undermine us. The king has grown paranoid enough that he\u2019s suspicious even of you and me\u2014I know you\u2019ve seen it. All Sadeas needs to do is find imaginary \u2018evidence\u2019 linking us to an attempt to kill the king, and he\u2019ll be able be able to turn Elhokar against us.\u201D\r\n\u201CWe may have to risk that.\u201D\r\nAdolin frowned. \u201CBut\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CI trust Sadeas, son,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CBut even if I didn\u2019t, we couldn\u2019t forbid him entry or block his investigation. We\u2019d not only look guilty in the king\u2019s eyes, but we\u2019d be denying his authority as well.\u201D He shook his head. \u201CIf I ever want the other highprinces to accept me as their leader in war, I have to be willing to allow Sadeas his authority as Highprince of Information. I can\u2019t rely upon the old traditions for my authority yet deny Sadeas the same right.\u201D\r\n\u201CI suppose,\u201D Adolin admitted. \u201CBut we could still prepare. You can\u2019t tell me you\u2019re not a little worried.\u201D\r\nDalinar hesitated. \u201CPerhaps. This maneuver of Sadeas\u2019s is aggressive. But I\u2019ve been told what to do. \u2018Trust Sadeas. Be strong. Act with honor, and honor will aid you.\u2019 That is the advice I\u2019ve been given.\u201D\r\n\u201CFrom where?\u201D\r\nDalinar looked to him, and it became obvious to Adolin.\r\n\u201CSo we\u2019re betting the future of our house on these visions now,\u201D Adolin said flatly.\r\n\u201CI wouldn\u2019t say that,\u201D Dalinar replied. \u201CIf Sadeas did move against us, I wouldn\u2019t simply let him shove us over. But I\u2019m also not going to make the first move against him.\u201D\r\n\u201CBecause of what you\u2019ve seen,\u201D Adolin said, growing frustrated. \u201CFather, you said you\u2019d listen to what I had to say about the visions. Well, please listen now.\u201D\r\n\u201CThis isn\u2019t the proper place.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou always have an excuse,\u201D Adolin said. \u201CI\u2019ve tried to approach you about it five times now, and you always rebuff me!\u201D\r\n\u201CPerhaps it\u2019s because I know what you\u2019ll say,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CAnd I know it won\u2019t do any good.\u201D\r\n\u201COr perhaps it\u2019s because you don\u2019t want to be confronted by the truth.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s enough, Adolin.\u201D\r\n\u201CNo, no it\u2019s not! We\u2019re mocked in every one of the warcamps, our authority and reputation diminishes by the day, and\r\nyourefuse to do anything substantial about it!\u201D\r\n\u201CAdolin. I will\r\nnottake this from my son.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut you\u2019ll take it from everyone else? Why is that, Father? When others say things about us, you let them. But when Renarin or I take the smallest step toward what\r\nyouview as being inappropriate, we\u2019re immediately chastised! Everyone else can speak lies, but I can\u2019t speak the truth? Do your sons mean so little to you?\u201D\r\nDalinar froze, looking as if he\u2019d been slapped.\r\n\u201CYou aren\u2019t\r\nwell, Father,\u201D Adolin continued. Part of him realized that he had gone too far, that he was speaking too loudly, but it boiled out anyway. \u201CWe need to stop tiptoeing around it!\r\nYouneed to stop making up increasingly irrational explanations to reason away your lapses! I know it\u2019s hard to accept, but sometimes, people get old. Sometimes, the mind stops working right.\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong. Maybe it\u2019s your guilt over Gavilar\u2019s death. That book, the Codes, the visions\u2014maybe they\u2019re all attempts to find escape, find redemption, something. What you see\r\nis notreal. Your life now is a rationalization, a way of trying to pretend that what\u2019s happening isn\u2019t happening. But I\u2019ll go to\r\nDamnation itselfbefore I\u2019ll let you drag the entire house down without speaking my mind on it!\u201D\r\nHe practically shouted those last words. They echoed in the large chamber, and Adolin realized he was shaking. He had never, in all his years of life, spoken to his father in such a way.\r\n\u201CYou think I haven\u2019t wondered these things?\u201D Dalinar said, his voice cold, his eyes hard. \u201CI\u2019ve gone through each point you\u2019ve made a dozen times over.\u201D\r\n\u201CThen maybe you should go over them a few more.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\r\nmusttrust myself. The visions are trying to show me something important. I cannot prove it or explain how I know. But it\u2019s true.\u201D\r\n\u201COf course you think that,\u201D Adolin said, exasperated. \u201CDon\u2019t you see? That\u2019s exactly what you\r\nwouldfeel. Men are very good at seeing what they want to! Look at the king. He sees a killer in every shadow, and a worn strap becomes a convoluted plot to take his life.\u201D\r\nDalinar fell silent again.\r\n\u201CSometimes, the simple answers\r\narethe right ones, Father!\u201D Adolin said. \u201CThe king\u2019s strap just wore out. And you\u2026you\u2019re seeing things that aren\u2019t there. I\u2019m sorry.\u201D\r\nThey locked expressions. Adolin didn\u2019t look away. He wouldn\u2019t look away.\r\nDalinar finally turned from him. \u201CLeave me, please.\u201D\r\n\u201CAll right. Fine. But I want you to think about this. I want you to\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CAdolin.\r\nGo.\u201D\r\nAdolin gritted his teeth, but turned and stalked away.\r\nIt needed to be said,he told himself as he left the gallery.\r\nThat didn\u2019t make him feel any less sick about having to be the one who said it."

      "ChapterName": "25: THE BUTCHER",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\nSEVEN YEARS AGO\r\n\u201CIt ain\u2019t right, what they do,\u201D the woman\u2019s voice said. \u201CYou ain\u2019t supposed to cut into folks, peering in to see what the Almighty placed hidden for good reason.\u201D\r\nKal froze, standing in an alleyway between two houses in Hearthstone. The sky was wan overhead; winter had come for a time. The Weeping was near, and highstorms were infrequent. For now, it was too cold for plants to enjoy the respite; rockbuds spent winter weeks curled up inside their shells. Most creatures hibernated, waiting for warmth to return. Fortunately, seasons generally lasted only a few weeks. Unpredictability. That was the way of the world. Only after death was there stability. So the ardents taught, at least.\r\nKal wore a thick, padded coat of breachtree cotton. The material was scratchy but warm, and had been dyed a deep brown. He kept the hood up, his hands in his pockets. To his right sat the baker\u2019s place\u2014the family slept in the triangular crawlspace in back, and the front was their store. To Kal\u2019s left was one of Hearthstone\u2019s taverns, where lavis ale and mudbeer flowed in abundance during winter weeks.\r\nHe could hear two women, unseen but chatting a short distance way.\r\n\u201CYou know that he stole from the old citylord,\u201D one woman\u2019s voice said, keeping her voice down. \u201CAn entire goblet full of spheres. The surgeon says they were a gift, but he was the only one there when the citylord died.\u201D\r\n\u201CThere\r\nisa document, I hear,\u201D the first voice said.\r\n\u201CA few glyphs. Not a proper will. And whose hand wrote those glyphs? The surgeon himself. It ain\u2019t right, the citylord not having a woman there to be scribe. I\u2019m telling you. It ain\u2019t right what they do.\u201D\r\nKal gritted his teeth, tempted to step out and let the women see that he\u2019d heard them. His father wouldn\u2019t approve, though. Lirin wouldn\u2019t want to cause strife or embarrassment.\r\nBut that was his father. So Kal marched right out of the alleyway, passing Nanha Terith and Nanha Relina standing and gossiping in front of the bakery. Terith was the baker\u2019s wife, a fat woman with curly dark hair. She was in the middle of another calumny. Kal gave her a sharp look, and her brown eyes showed a satisfying moment of discomfiture.\r\nKal crossed the square carefully, wary of patches of ice. The door to the bakery slammed shut behind him, the two women fleeing inside.\r\nHis satisfaction didn\u2019t last long. Why did people always say such things about his father? They called him morbid and unnatural, but would scurry out to buy glyphwards and charms from a passing apothecary or luck-merch. The Almighty pity a man who actually did something\r\nusefulto help!\r\nStill stewing, Kal turned a few corners, walking to where his mother stood on a stepladder at the side of the town hall, carefully chipping at the eaves of the building. Hesina was a tall woman, and she usually kept her hair pulled back into a tail, then wrapped a kerchief around her head. Today, she wore a knit hat over that. She had a long brown coat that matched Kal\u2019s, and the blue hem of her skirt just barely peeked out at the bottom.\r\nThe objects of her attention were a set of icicle-like pendants of rock that had formed on the edges of the roof. Highstorms dropped stormwater, and stormwater carried crem. If left alone, crem eventually hardened into stone. Buildings grew stalactites, formed by stormwater slowly dripping from the eaves. You had to clean them off regularly, or risk weighing down the roof so much that it collapsed.\r\nShe noticed him and smiled, her cheeks flushed from the cold. With a narrow face, a bold chin, and full lips, she was a pretty woman. At least Kal thought so. Prettier than the baker\u2019s wife, for sure.\r\n\u201CYour father dismissed you from your lessons already?\u201D she asked.\r\n\u201CEveryone hates Father,\u201D Kal blurted out.\r\nHis mother turned back to her work. \u201CKaladin, you\u2019re thirteen. You\u2019re old enough to know not to say foolish things like that.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s true,\u201D he said stubbornly. \u201CI heard some women talking, just now. They said that Father stole the spheres from Brightlord Wistiow. They say that Father enjoys slicing people open and doing things that ain\u2019t natural.\u201D\r\n\u201C\r\nAren\u2019tnatural.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhy can\u2019t I speak like everyone else?\u201D\r\n\u201CBecause it isn\u2019t proper.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s proper enough for Nanha Terith.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd what do you think of her?\u201D\r\nKal hesitated. \u201CShe\u2019s ignorant. And she likes to gossip about things she doesn\u2019t know anything about.\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, then. If you wish to emulate her, I can obviously find no objection to the practice.\u201D\r\nKal grimaced. You had to watch yourself when speaking with Hesina; she liked to twist words about. He leaned back against the wall of the town hall, watching his breath puff out in front of him. Perhaps a different tactic would work. \u201CMother,\r\nwhydo people hate Father?\u201D\r\n\u201CThey don\u2019t hate him,\u201D she said. However, his calmly asked question got her to continue. \u201CBut he\r\ndoesmake them uncomfortable.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhy?\u201D\r\n\u201CBecause some people are frightened of knowledge. Your father is a learned man; he knows things the others can\u2019t understand. So those things must be dark and mysterious.\u201D\r\n\u201CThey aren\u2019t afraid of luckmerches and glyphwards.\u201D\r\n\u201CThose you can understand,\u201D his mother said calmly. \u201CYou burn a glyphward out in front of your house, and it will turn away evil. It\u2019s easy. Your father won\u2019t give someone a ward to heal them. He\u2019ll insist that they stay\u00A0in bed, drinking water, taking some foul medicine, and washing their wound each day. It\u2019s hard. They\u2019d rather leave it all to fate.\u201D\r\nKal considered that. \u201CI think they hate him because he fails too often.\u201D\r\n\u201CThere is that. If a glyphward fails, you can blame it on the will of the Almighty. If your father fails, then it\u2019s his fault. Or such is the perception.\u201D His mother continued working, flakes of stone falling to the ground around her. \u201CThey\u2019ll never actually\r\nhateyour father\u2014he\u2019s too useful. But he\u2019ll never really be one of them. That\u2019s the price of being a surgeon. Having power over the lives of men is an uncomfortable responsibility.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd if I don\u2019t want that responsibility? What if I just want to be something normal, like a baker, or a farmer, or\u2026\u201D\r\nOr a soldier,he added in his mind. He\u2019d picked up a staff a few times in secret, and though he\u2019d never been able to replicate that moment when he\u2019d fought Jost, there\r\nwassomething invigorating about holding a weapon. Something that drew him and excited him.\r\n\u201CI think,\u201D his mother said, \u201Cthat you\u2019ll find the lives of bakers and farmers are not so enviable.\u201D\r\n\u201CAt least they have friends.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd so do you. What of Tien?\u201D\r\n\u201CTien\u2019s not my friend, Mother. He\u2019s my brother.\u201D\r\n\u201COh, and he can\u2019t be both at once?\u201D\r\nKal rolled his eyes. \u201CYou know what I mean.\u201D\r\nShe climbed down from the stepladder, patting his shoulder. \u201CYes, I do, and I\u2019m sorry to make light of it. But you put yourself in a difficult position. You want friends, but do you really want to\r\nactlike the other boys? Give up your studies so you can slave in the fields? Grow old before your time, weathered and furrowed by the sun?\u201D\r\nKal didn\u2019t reply.\r\n\u201CThe things that others have always seem better than what you have,\u201D his mother said. \u201CBring the stepladder.\u201D\r\nKal followed dutifully, rounding the town hall to the other side, then putting down the ladder so his mother could climb up to begin work again.\r\n\u201CThe others think Father stole those spheres.\u201D Kal shoved his hands in his pockets. \u201CThey think he wrote out that order from Brightlord Wistiow and had the old man sign it when he didn\u2019t know what he was doing.\u201D\r\nHis mother was silent.\r\n\u201CI hate their lies and gossip,\u201D Kal said. \u201CI hate them for making up things about us.\u201D\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t hate them, Kal. They\u2019re good people. In this case, they\u2019re just repeating what they\u2019ve heard.\u201D She glanced at the citylord\u2019s manor, distant upon a hill above the town. Every time Kal saw it, he felt like he should go up and talk to Laral. But the last few times he\u2019d tried, he hadn\u2019t been allowed to see her. Now that her father was dead, her nurse oversaw her time, and the woman didn\u2019t think mingling with boys from the town was appropriate.\r\nThe nurse\u2019s husband, Miliv, had been Brightlord Wistiow\u2019s head steward. If there was a source of bad rumors about Kal\u2019s family, it probably came from him. He never\r\nhadliked Kal\u2019s father. Well, Miliv wouldn\u2019t matter soon. A new citylord was expected to arrive any day.\r\n\u201CMother,\u201D Kal said, \u201Cthose spheres are just sitting there doing nothing but glowing. Can\u2019t we spend some to keep you from having to come out here and work?\u201D\r\n\u201CI like working,\u201D she said, scraping away again. \u201CIt clears the head.\u201D\r\n\u201CDidn\u2019t you just tell me that I wouldn\u2019t like having to labor? My face furrowed before its time, or something poetic like that?\u201D\r\nShe hesitated, then laughed. \u201CClever boy.\u201D\r\n\u201CCold boy,\u201D he grumbled, shivering.\r\n\u201CI work because I want to. We can\u2019t spend those spheres\u2014they\u2019re for your education\u2014and so my working is better than forcing your father to charge for his healings.\u201D\r\n\u201CMaybe they\u2019d respect us more if we did charge.\u201D\r\n\u201COh, they respect us. No, I don\u2019t think that is the problem.\u201D She looked down at Kal. \u201CYou know that we\u2019re second nahn.\u201D\r\n\u201CSure,\u201D Kal said, shrugging.\r\n\u201CAn accomplished young surgeon of the right rank could draw the attention of a poorer noble family, one who wished money and acclaim. It happens in the larger cities.\u201D\r\nKal glanced up at the mansion again. \u201CThat\u2019s why you encouraged me to play with Laral so much. You wanted to marry me off to her, didn\u2019t you?\u201D\r\n\u201CIt was a possibility,\u201D his mother said, returning to her work.\r\nHe honestly wasn\u2019t certain how he felt about that. The last few months had been strange for Kal. His father had forced him into his studies, but in secret he\u2019d spent his time with the staff. Two possible paths. Both enticing. Kal\r\ndidlike learning, and he longed for the ability to help people, bind their wounds, make them better. He saw true nobility in what his father did.\r\nBut it seemed to Kal that if he could fight, he could do something even more noble. Protect their lands, like the great lighteyed heroes of the stories. And there was the way he felt when holding a weapon.\r\nTwo paths. Opposites, in many ways. He could only choose one.\r\nHis mother kept chipping away at the eaves, and\u2014with a sigh\u2014Kal fetched a second stepladder and set of tools from the workroom, then joined her. He was tall for his age, but he still had to stand high on the ladder. He caught his mother smiling as he worked, no doubt pleased at having raised such a helpful young man. In reality, Kal just wanted the chance to pound on something.\r\nHow would he feel, marrying someone like Laral? He\u2019d never be her equal. Their children would have a chance of being lighteyed or darkeyed, so even his children might outrank him. He knew he\u2019d feel terribly out of place. That was another aspect of becoming a surgeon. If he chose that path, he would be choosing the life of his father. Choosing to set himself apart, to be isolated.\r\nIf he went to war, however, he would have a place. Maybe he could even do the nearly unthinkable, win a Shardblade and become a true lighteyes. Then he could marry Laral and not have to be her inferior. Was that why she\u2019d always encouraged him to become a soldier? Had she been thinking about these kinds of things, even back then? Back then, these kinds of decisions\u2014marriage, his future\u2014had seemed impossibly far-off to Kal.\r\nHe felt so young. Did he really have to consider these questions? It would still be another few years before the surgeons of Kharbranth would let him take their tests. But if he\r\nweregoing to become a soldier instead, he\u2019d have to join the army before that happened. How would his father react if Kal just up and went with the recruiters? Kal wasn\u2019t certain he\u2019d be able to face Lirin\u2019s disappointed eyes.\r\nAs if in response to his thoughts, Lirin\u2019s voice called from nearby. \u201CHesina!\u201D\r\nKal\u2019s mother turned, smiling and tucking a stray lock of dark hair back into her kerchief. Kal\u2019s father rushed down the street, his face anxious. Kal felt a sudden jolt of worry. Who was wounded? Why hadn\u2019t Lirin sent for him?\r\n\u201CWhat is it?\u201D Kal\u2019s mother asked, climbing down.\r\n\u201CHe\u2019s here, Hesina,\u201D Kal\u2019s father said.\r\n\u201CAbout time.\u201D\r\n\u201CWho?\u201D Kal asked, jumping down from the stepladder. \u201CWho\u2019s here?\u201D\r\n\u201CThe new citylord, son,\u201D Lirin said, his breath puffing in the cold air. \u201CHis name is Brightlord Roshone. No time to change, I\u2019m afraid. Not if we want to catch his first speech. Come on!\u201D\r\nThe three of them hurried away, Kal\u2019s thoughts and worries banished in the face of the chance to meet a new lighteyes.\r\n\u201CHe didn\u2019t send word ahead,\u201D Lirin said under his breath.\r\n\u201CThat could be a good sign,\u201D Hesina replied. \u201CMaybe he doesn\u2019t feel he needs everyone to dote on him.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat, or he\u2019s inconsiderate. Stormfather, I hate getting a new Landed. Always makes me feel like I\u2019m throwing a handful of stones into a game of breakneck. Will we throw the queen or the tower?\u201D\r\n\u201CWe shall see soon enough,\u201D Hesina said, glancing at Kal. \u201CDon\u2019t let your father\u2019s words unnerve you. He always gets pessimistic at times like this.\u201D\r\n\u201CI do\r\nnot,\u201D Lirin said.\r\nShe gave him a look.\r\n\u201CName one other time.\u201D\r\n\u201CMeeting my parents.\u201D\r\nKal\u2019s father pulled up short, blinking. \u201CStormwinds,\u201D he muttered, \u201Clet\u2019s hope this doesn\u2019t go\r\nhalfas poorly as that.\u201D\r\nKal listened with curiosity. He\u2019d never met his mother\u2019s parents; they weren\u2019t often spoken of. Soon, the three of them reached the south side of town. A crowd was gathered, and Tien was already there, waiting. He waved in his excitable way, jumping up and down.\r\n\u201CWish I had half that boy\u2019s energy,\u201D Lirin said.\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve got a place for us picked out!\u201D Tien called eagerly, pointing. \u201CBy the rain barrels! Come on! We\u2019re going to miss it!\u201D\r\nTien scurried over, climbing atop the barrels. Several of the town\u2019s other boys noticed him, and they nudged one another, one making some comment Kal couldn\u2019t hear. It set the others laughing at Tien, and that immediately made Kal furious. Tien didn\u2019t deserve mockery just because he was a little small for his age.\r\nThis wasn\u2019t a good time to confront the other boys, though, so Kal sullenly joined his parents beside the barrels. Tien smiled at him, standing atop his barrel. He\u2019d piled a few of his favorite rocks near him, stones of different colors and shapes. There were rocks all around them, and yet Tien was the only person he knew who found wonder in them. After a moment\u2019s consideration, Kal climbed atop a barrel\u2014careful not to disturb any of Tien\u2019s rocks\u2014so he too could get a better view of the citylord\u2019s procession.\r\nIt was enormous. There must have been a dozen wagons in that line, following a fine black carriage pulled by four sleek black horses. Kal gawked despite himself. Wistiow had only owned one horse, and it had seemed as old as he was.\r\nCould one man, even a lighteyes, own that much furniture? Where would he put it all? And there were people too. Dozens of them, riding in the wagons, walking in groups. There were also a dozen soldiers in gleaming breastplates and leather skirts. This lighteyes even had his own honor guard.\r\nEventually the procession reached the turn-off to Hearthstone. A man riding a horse led the carriage and its soldiers forward to the town while most of the wagons continued up to the manor. Kal grew increasingly excited as the carriage rolled slowly into place. Would he finally get to see a real, lighteyed hero? The word around town claimed it was likely that the new citylord would be someone King Gavilar or Highprince Sadeas had promoted because he\u2019d distinguished himself in the wars to unite Alethkar.\r\nThe carriage turned sideways so that the door faced the crowd. The horses snorted and stomped the ground, and the carriage driver hopped down and quickly opened the door. A middle-aged man with a short, grey-streaked beard stepped out. He wore a ruffled violet coat, tailored so that it was short at the front\u2014reaching only to his waist\u2014but long at the back. Beneath it, he wore a golden takama, a long, straight skirt that went down to his calves.\r\nA takama. Few wore them anymore, but old soldiers in town spoke of the days when they\u2019d been popular as warrior\u2019s garb. Kal hadn\u2019t expected the takama to look so much like a woman\u2019s skirt, but still, it was a good sign. Roshone himself seemed a little too old, a little too flabby, to be a true soldier. But he wore a sword.\r\nThe lighteyed man scanned the crowd, a distasteful look on his face, as if he\u2019d swallowed something bitter. Behind the man, two people peeked out. A younger man with a narrow face and an older woman with braided hair. Roshone studied the crowd, then shook his head and turned around to climb back in the carriage.\r\nKal frowned. Wasn\u2019t he going to say anything? The crowd seemed to share Kal\u2019s shock; a few of them began whispering in anxiety.\r\n\u201CBrightlord Roshone!\u201D Kal\u2019s father called.\r\nThe crowd hushed. The lighteyed man glanced back. People shied away, and Kal found himself shrinking down beneath that harsh gaze. \u201CWho spoke?\u201D Roshone demanded, his voice a low baritone.\r\nLirin stepped forward, raising a hand. \u201CBrightlord. Was your trip pleasant? Please, can we show you the town?\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat is your name?\u201D\r\n\u201CLirin, Brightlord. Hearthstone\u2019s surgeon.\u201D\r\n\u201CAh,\u201D Roshone said. \u201CYou\u2019re the one who let old Wistiow die.\u201D The brightlord\u2019s expression darkened. \u201CIn a way, it\u2019s your fault I\u2019m in this pitiful, miserable quarter of the kingdom.\u201D He grunted, then climbed back in the carriage and slammed the door. Within seconds, the carriage driver had replaced the stairs, climbed into his place, and started turning the vehicle around.\r\nKal\u2019s father slowly let his arm fall to his side. The townspeople began to chatter immediately, gossiping about the soldiers, the carriage, the horses.\r\nKal sat down on his barrel.\r\nWell,he thought.\r\nI guess we could expect a warrior to be curt, right?The heroes from the legends weren\u2019t necessarily the polite types. Killing people and fancy talking didn\u2019t always go together, old Jarel had once told him.\r\nLirin walked back, his expression troubled.\r\n\u201CWell?\u201D Hesina said, trying to sound cheerful. \u201CWhat do you think? Did we throw the queen or the tower?\u201D\r\n\u201CNeither.\u201D\r\n\u201COh? And what did we throw instead?\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m not sure,\u201D he said, glancing over his shoulder. \u201CA pair and a trio, maybe. Let\u2019s get back home.\u201D\r\nTien scratched his head in confusion, but the words weighed on Kal. The tower was three pairs in a game of breakneck. The queen was two trios. The first was an outright loss, the other an outright win.\r\nBut a pair and a trio, that was called the butcher. Whether you won or not would depend on the other throws you made.\r\nAnd, more importantly, on the throws of everyone else."

      "ChapterName": "26: STILLNESS",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\nI am being chased. Your friends of the Seventeenth Shard, I suspect. I believe they\u2019re still lost, following a false trail I left for them. They\u2019ll be happier that way. I doubt they have any inkling what to do with me should they actually catch me.\r\n\u201CI stood in the darkened monastery chamber,\u2019\u201D Litima read, standing at the lectern with the tome open before her, \u201C\u2018its far reaches painted with pools of black where light did not wander. I sat on the floor, thinking of that dark, that Unseen. I could not know, for certain, what was hidden in that night. I suspected there were walls, sturdy and thick, but could I\r\nknowwithout seeing? When all was hidden, what could a man rely upon as True?\u2019\u201D\r\nLitima\u2014one of Dalinar\u2019s scribes\u2014was tall and plump and wore a violet silk gown with yellow trim. She read to Dalinar as he stood, regarding the maps on the wall of his sitting room. That room was fitted with handsome wood furnishings and fine woven rugs imported up from Marat. A crystal carafe of afternoon wine\u2014orange, not intoxicating\u2014sat on a high-legged serving table in the corner, sparkling with the light of the diamond spheres hanging in chandeliers above.\r\n\u201C\u2018Candle flames,\u2019\u201D Litima continued. The selection was from\r\nThe Way of Kings, read from the very copy that Gavilar had once owned. \u201C\u2018A dozen candles burned themselves to death on the shelf before me. Each of my breaths made them tremble. To them, I was a behemoth, to frighten and destroy. And yet, if I strayed too close,\r\ntheycould destroy\r\nme. My invisible breath, the pulses of life that flowed in and out, could end them freely, while my fingers could not do the same without being repaid in pain.\u2019\u201D\r\nDalinar idly twisted his signet ring in thought; it was sapphire with his Kholin glyphpair on it. Renarin stood next to him, wearing a coat of blue and silver, golden knots on the shoulders marking him as a prince. Adolin wasn\u2019t there. Dalinar and he had been stepping gingerly around one another since their argument in the Gallery.\r\n\u201C\u2018I understood in a moment of stillness,\u2019\u201D Litima read. \u201C\u2018Those candle flames were like the lives of men. So fragile. So deadly. Left alone, they lit and warmed. Let run rampant, they would destroy the very things they were meant to illuminate. Embryonic bonfires, each bearing a seed of destruction so potent it could tumble cities and dash kings to their knees. In later years, my mind would return to that calm, silent evening, when I had stared at rows of living lights. And I would understand. To be given loyalty is to be infused like a gemstone, to be granted the frightful license to destroy not only one\u2019s self, but all within one\u2019s care.\u2019\u201D\r\nLitima fell still. It was the end of the sequence.\r\n\u201CThank you, Brightness Litima,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CThat will do.\u201D\r\nThe woman bowed her head respectfully. She gathered her youthful ward from the side of the room and they withdrew, leaving the book on the lectern.\r\nThat sequence had become one of Dalinar\u2019s favorites. Listening to it often comforted him. Someone else had known, someone else had understood, how he felt. But today, it didn\u2019t bring the solace it usually did. It only reminded him of Adolin\u2019s arguments. None had been things Dalinar hadn\u2019t considered himself, but being confronted with them by someone he trusted had shaken everything. He found himself staring at his maps, smaller copies of those that hung in the Gallery. They had been recreated for him by the royal cartographer, Isasik Shulin.\r\nWhat if Dalinar\u2019s visions really\r\nwerejust phantasms? He\u2019d often longed for the glory days of Alethkar\u2019s past. Were the visions his mind\u2019s answer to that, a subconscious way of letting himself be a hero, of giving himself justification for doggedly seeking his goals?\r\nA disturbing thought. Looked at another way, those phantom commands to \u201Cunify\u201D sounded a great deal like what the Hierocracy had said when it had tried to conquer the world five centuries before.\r\nDalinar turned from his maps and walked across the room, his booted feet falling on a soft rug. Too nice a rug. He\u2019d spent the better part of his life in one warcamp or another; he\u2019d slept in wagons, stone barracks, and tents pulled tight against the leeward side of stone formations. Compared with that, his present dwelling was practically a mansion. He felt as if he should cast out all of this finery. But what would that accomplish?\r\nHe stopped at the lectern and ran his fingers along the thick pages filled with lines in violet ink. He couldn\u2019t read the words, but he could almost\r\nfeelthem, emanating from the page like Stormlight from a sphere. Were the words of this book the cause of his problems? The visions had started several months after he\u2019d first listened to readings from it.\r\nHe rested his hand on the cold, ink-filled pages. Their homeland was stressed nearly to breaking, the war was stalled, and suddenly he found himself captivated by the very ideals and myths that had led to his brother\u2019s downfall. This was a time the Alethi needed the Blackthorn, not an old, tired soldier who fancied himself a philosopher.\r\nBlast it all,he thought.\r\nI thought I\u2019d figured this out!He closed the leather-bound volume, the spine crackling. He carried it to the bookshelf and returned it to its place.\r\n\u201CFather?\u201D Renarin asked. \u201CIs there something I can do for you?\u201D\r\n\u201CI wish there were, son.\u201D Dalinar tapped the spine of the book lightly. \u201CIt\u2019s ironic. This book was once considered one of the great masterpieces of political philosophy. Did you know that? Jasnah told me that kings around the world used to study it daily. Now, it is considered borderline blasphemous.\u201D\r\nRenarin gave no reply.\r\n\u201CRegardless,\u201D Dalinar said, walking back to the wall map. \u201CHighprince Aladar refused my offer of an alliance, just as Roion did. Do you have a thought on whom should I approach next?\u201D\r\n\u201CAdolin says we should be far more worried about Sadeas\u2019s ploy to destroy us than we are.\u201D\r\nThe room fell silent. Renarin had a habit of doing that, felling conversations like an enemy archer hunting officers on the battlefield.\r\n\u201CYour brother is right to worry,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CBut moving against Sadeas would undermine Alethkar as a kingdom. For the same reason, Sadeas won\u2019t risk acting against us. He\u2019ll see.\u201D\r\nI hope.\r\nHorns suddenly sounded outside, their deep, resounding calls echoing. Dalinar and Renarin froze. Parshendi spotted on the Plains. A second set came. Twenty-third plateau of the second quadrant. Dalinar\u2019s scouts thought the contested plateau close enough for their forces to reach first.\r\nDalinar dashed across the room, all other thoughts discarded for the moment, his booted feet thumping on the thick rug. He threw open the door and charged down the Stormlight-illuminated hallway.\r\nThe war room door was open, and Teleb\u2014highofficer on duty\u2014saluted as Dalinar entered. Teleb was a straight-backed man with light green eyes. He kept his long hair in a braid and had a blue tattoo on his cheek, marking him as an Oldblood. At the side of the room, his wife, Kalami, sat behind a long-legged desk on a high stool. She wore her dark hair with only two small side braids pinned up, the rest hanging down the back of her violet dress to brush the top of the stool. She was a historian of note, and had requested permission to record meetings like this one; she planned to scribe a history of the war.\r\n\u201CSir,\u201D Teleb said. \u201CA chasmfiend crawled atop the plateau here less than a quarter hour ago.\u201D He pointed to the battle map, which had glyphs marking each plateau. Dalinar stepped up to it, a group of his officers gathering around him.\r\n\u201CHow far would you say that is?\u201D Dalinar asked, rubbing his chin.\r\n\u201CPerhaps two hours,\u201D Teleb said, indicating a route one of his men had drawn on the map. \u201CSir, I think we have a good chance at this one. Brightlord Aladar will have to traverse six unclaimed plateaus to reach the contested area, while we have a nearly direct line. Brightlord Sadeas would have trouble, as he\u2019d have to work his way around several large chasms too wide to cross with bridges. I\u2019ll bet he won\u2019t even try for it.\u201D\r\nDalinar did, indeed, have the most direct line. He hesitated, though. It had been months since he\u2019d last gone on a plateau run. His attention had been diverted, his troops needed for protecting roadways and patrolling the large markets that had grown up outside the warcamps. And now, Adolin\u2019s questions weighed upon him, pressing him down. It seemed like a terrible time to go out to battle.\r\nNo,he thought.\r\nNo, I need to do this.Winning a plateau skirmish would do much for his troops\u2019 morale, and would help discredit the rumors in camp.\r\n\u201CWe march!\u201D Dalinar declared.\r\nA few of the officers whooped in excitement, an extreme show of emotion for the normally reserved Alethi.\r\n\u201CAnd your son, Brightlord?\u201D Teleb asked. He\u2019d heard of the confrontation between them. Dalinar doubted there was a person in all ten warcamps who hadn\u2019t heard of it.\r\n\u201CSend for him,\u201D Dalinar said firmly. Adolin probably needed this as much as, or more than, Dalinar did.\r\nThe officers scattered. Dalinar\u2019s armor bearers entered a moment later. It had only been a few minutes since the horns had sounded, but after six\u00A0years of fighting, the machine of war ran smoothly when battle called. From outside, he heard the horns\u2019 third set begin, calling his forces to battle.\r\nThe armor bearers inspected his boots\u2014checking to be certain the laces were tight\u2014then brought a long padded vest to throw over his uniform. Next, they set the sabatons\u2014armor for his boots\u2014on the floor before him. They encased his boots entirely and had a rough surface on the bottoms that seemed to cling to rock. The interiors glowed with the light of the sapphires in their indented pockets.\r\nDalinar was reminded of his most recent vision. The Radiant, his armor glowing with glyphs. Modern Shardplate didn\u2019t glow like that. Could his mind have fabricated that detail? Would it have?\r\nNo time to consider that now,he thought. He discarded his uncertainties and worries, something he\u2019d learned to do during his first battles as a youth. A warrior needed to be focused. Adolin\u2019s questions would still be waiting for him when he got back. For now, he couldn\u2019t afford self-doubt or uncertainty. It was time to be the Blackthorn.\r\nHe stepped into the sabatons, and the straps tightened of their own accord, fitting around his boots. The greaves came next, going over his legs and knees, locking on to the sabatons. Shardplate wasn\u2019t like ordinary armor; there was no mesh of steel mail and no leather straps at the joints. Shardplate seams were made of smaller plates, interlocking, overlapping, incredibly intricate, leaving no vulnerable gaps. There was very little rubbing or chafing; each piece fit together perfectly, as if it had been crafted specifically for Dalinar.\r\nOne always put the armor on from the feet upward. Shardplate was extremely heavy; without the enhanced strength it provided, no man would be able to fight in it. Dalinar stood still as the armor bearers affixed the cuisses over his thighs and locked them to the culet and faulds across his waist and lower back. A skirt made of small, interlocking plates came next, reaching down to just above the knees.\r\n\u201CBrightlord,\u201D Teleb said, stepping up to him. \u201CHave you given thought to my suggestion about the bridges?\u201D\r\n\u201CYou know how I feel about man-carried bridges, Teleb,\u201D Dalinar said as the armor bearers locked his breastplate into place, then worked on the rerebraces and vambraces for his arms. Already, he could feel the strength of the Plate surging through him.\r\n\u201CWe wouldn\u2019t have to use the smaller bridges for the assault,\u201D Teleb said. \u201CJust for getting to the contested plateau.\u201D\r\n\u201CWe\u2019d still have to bring the chull-pulled bridges to get across that last chasm,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CI\u2019m not convinced that bridge crews would move us any more quickly. Not when we have to wait for those animals.\u201D\r\nTeleb sighed.\r\nDalinar reconsidered. A good officer was one who accepted orders and fulfilled them, even when he disagreed. But the mark of a great officer was that he also tried to innovate and offer appropriate suggestions.\r\n\u201CYou may recruit and train a single bridge crew,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CWe shall see. In these races, even a few minutes can be meaningful.\u201D\r\nTeleb smiled. \u201CThank you, sir.\u201D\r\nDalinar waved with his left hand as the armor bearers locked the gauntlet onto his right. He made a fist, tiny plates curving perfectly. The left gauntlet followed. Then the gorget went over his head, covering his neck, the pauldrons on his shoulders, and the helm on his head. Finally, the armor bearers affixed his cape to the pauldrons.\r\nDalinar took a deep breath, feeling the Thrill build for the approaching battle. He strode from the war room, footfalls firm and\r\nsolid. Attendants and servants scattered before him, making way. Wearing Shardplate again after a long period without was like waking up after a night of feeling groggy or disoriented. The spring of the step, the impetus the armor seemed to lend him, made him want to race down the hallway and\u2014\r\nAnd why not?\r\nHe broke into a sprint. Teleb and the others cried out in surprise, rushing to keep up. Dalinar outpaced them easily, reaching the front gates of the complex and leaping through, throwing himself off the long steps leading down from his enclave. He exulted, grinning as he hung in the air, then slammed to the ground. The force cracked the stone beneath him, and he crouched into the impact.\r\nBefore him, neat rows of barracks ran through his warcamp, formed in radials with a meeting ground and mess hall at the center of each battalion. His officers reached the top of the stairs, looking down with amazement. Renarin was with them, wearing his uniform that had never seen battle, his hand raised against the sunlight.\r\nDalinar felt foolish. Was he a youth just given his first taste of Shardplate?\r\nBack to work. Stop playing.\r\nPerethom, his infantrylord, saluted as Dalinar strode up. \u201CSecond and Third Battalions are on duty today, Brightlord. Forming ranks to march.\u201D\r\n\u201CFirst Bridge Squad is gathered, Brightlord,\u201D Havarah\u2014the bridgelord\u2014said, striding up. He was a short man, with some Herdazian blood in him as evidenced by his dark, crystalline fingernails, though he didn\u2019t wear a spark-flicker. \u201CI have word from Ashelem that the archery company is ready.\u201D\r\n\u201CCavalry?\u201D Dalinar asked. \u201CAnd where is my son?\u201D\r\n\u201CHere, Father,\u201D called a familiar voice. Adolin\u2014his Shardplate painted a deep Kholin blue\u2014made his way through the gathering crowd. His visor was up, and he looked eager, though when he met Dalinar\u2019s eyes, he glanced away immediately.\r\nDalinar held up a hand, quieting several officers who were trying to give him reports. He strode to Adolin, and the youth looked up, meeting his gaze.\r\n\u201CYou said what you felt you must,\u201D Dalinar said.\r\n\u201CAnd I\u2019m not sorry I did,\u201D Adolin replied. \u201CBut I\r\namsorry for how, and where, I said it. That won\u2019t happen again.\u201D\r\nDalinar nodded, and that was enough. Adolin seemed to relax, a weight coming off his shoulders, and Dalinar turned back to his officers. In moments, he and Adolin were leading a hurried group to the staging area. As they did, Dalinar did note Adolin waving to a young woman who stood beside the way, wearing a red dress, her hair up in a very nice braiding.\r\n\u201CIs that\u2014er\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CMalasha?\u201D Adolin said. \u201CYes.\u201D\r\n\u201CShe looks nice.\u201D\r\n\u201CMost of the time she is, though she\u2019s somewhat annoyed that I wouldn\u2019t let her come with me today.\u201D\r\n\u201CShe wanted to come into\r\nbattle?\u201D\r\nAdolin shrugged. \u201CSays she\u2019s curious.\u201D\r\nDalinar said nothing. Battle was a masculine art. A woman wanting to come to the battlefield was like\u2026well, like a man wanting to read. Unnatural.\r\nAhead, in the staging area, the battalions were forming ranks, and a squat lighteyed officer hurried up to Dalinar. He had patches of red hair on his otherwise dark Alethi head and a long, red mustache. Ilamar, the cavalrylord.\r\n\u201CBrightlord,\u201D he said, \u201Cmy apologies for the delay. Cavalry is mounted and ready.\u201D\r\n\u201CWe march, then,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CAll ranks\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CBrightlord!\u201D a voice said.\r\nDalinar turned as one of his messengers approached. The darkeyed man wore leathers marked with blue bands on the arms. He saluted, saying, \u201CHighprince Sadeas has demanded admittance to the warcamp!\u201D\r\nDalinar glanced at Adolin. His son\u2019s expression darkened.\r\n\u201CHe claims the king\u2019s writ of investigation grants him the right,\u201D the messenger said.\r\n\u201CAdmit him,\u201D Dalinar said.\r\n\u201CYes, Brightlord,\u201D the messenger said, turning back. One of the lesser officers, Moratel, went with him so that Sadeas could be welcomed and escorted by a lighteyes as befitted his station. Moratel was least among those in attendance; everyone understood he was the one Dalinar would send.\r\n\u201CWhat do you think Sadeas wants this time?\u201D Dalinar said quietly to Adolin.\r\n\u201COur blood. Preferably warm, perhaps sweetened with a shot of tallew brandy.\u201D\r\nDalinar grimaced, and the two of them hurried past the ranks of soldiers. The men had an air of anticipation, spears held high, darkeyed citizen officers standing at the sides with axes on their shoulders. At the front of the force, a group of chulls snorted and rummaged at the rocks by their feet; harnessed to them were several enormous mobile bridges.\r\nGallant and Adolin\u2019s white stallion Sureblood were waiting, their reins held at the ready by grooms. Ryshadium hardly needed handlers. Once, Gallant had kicked open his stall and made his way to the staging grounds on his own when a groom had been too slow. Dalinar patted the midnight destrier on the neck, then swung into the saddle.\r\nHe scanned the staging field, then raised his arm to give the command to move. However, he noticed a group of mounted men riding up to the staging field, led by a figure in dark red Shardplate. Sadeas.\r\nDalinar stifled a sigh and gave the command to move out, though he himself waited for the Highprince of Information. Adolin came over on Sureblood, and he gave Dalinar a glance that seemed to say, \u201CDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll behave.\u201D\r\nAs always, Sadeas was a model of fashion, his armor painted, his helm ornamented with a completely different metallic pattern than he had worn last time. This one was shaped like a stylized sunburst. It looked almost like a crown.\r\n\u201CBrightlord Sadeas,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CThis is an inconvenient time for your investigation.\u201D\r\n\u201CUnfortunately,\u201D Sadeas said, reining in. \u201CHis Majesty is very eager to have answers, and I cannot stop my investigation, even for a plateau assault. I need to interview some of your soldiers. I\u2019ll do it on the way out.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou want to come\r\nwithus?\u201D\r\n\u201CWhy not? I won\u2019t delay you.\u201D He glanced at the chulls, who lurched into motion, pulling the bulky bridges. \u201CI doubt that even were I to decide to\r\ncrawl, I could slow you any further.\u201D\r\n\u201COur soldiers need to concentrate on the upcoming battle, Brightlord,\u201D Adolin said. \u201CThey should not be distracted.\u201D\r\n\u201CThe king\u2019s will must be done,\u201D Sadeas said, shrugging, not even bothering to look at Adolin. \u201CNeed I present the writ? Surely you don\u2019t intend to forbid me.\u201D\r\nDalinar studied his former friend, looking into those eyes, trying to see into the man\u2019s soul. Sadeas lacked his characteristic smirk; he usually wore one of those when he was pleased with how a plot was going. Did he realize that Dalinar knew how to read his expressions, and so masked his emotions? \u201CNo need to present anything, Sadeas. My men are at your disposal. If you have need of anything, simply ask. Adolin, with me.\u201D\r\nDalinar turned Gallant and galloped down the line toward the front of the marching army. Adolin followed reluctantly, and Sadeas remained behind with his attendants.\r\nThe long ride began. The permanent bridges here were Dalinar\u2019s, maintained and guarded by his soldiers and scouts, connecting plateaus that he controlled. Sadeas spent the trip riding near the middle of the column of two thousand. He periodically sent an attendant to pull certain soldiers out of line.\r\nDalinar spent the ride mentally preparing himself for the battle ahead. He spoke with his officers about the layout of the plateau, got a report on where specifically the chasmfiend had chosen to make its chrysalis, and sent scouts ahead to watch for Parshendi. Those scouts carried their long poles to get them from plateau to plateau without bridges.\r\nDalinar\u2019s force eventually reached the end of the permanent bridges, and had to start waiting for the chull bridges to be lowered across the chasms. The big machines were built like siege towers, with enormous wheels and armored sections at the side where soldiers could push. At a chasm, they unhooked the chulls, pushed the machine forward by hand, and ratcheted a crank at the back to lower the bridge. Once the bridge was set down, the machinery was unlocked and pulled across. The bridge was\u00A0 built so they could lock the machine onto the other side, pull the bridge up, then turn and hook the chulls up again.\r\nIt was a slow process. Dalinar watched from horseback, fingers tapping the side of his hogshide saddle as the first chasm was spanned. Perhaps Teleb was right. Could they use lighter, more portable bridges to get across these early chasms, then resort to the siege bridges only for the final assault?\r\nA clatter of hooves on rock announced someone riding up the side of the column. Dalinar turned, expecting Adolin, and instead found Sadeas.\r\nWhy\r\nhadSadeas asked to be Highprince of Information, and why was he so dogged in pursuing this matter of the broken girth? If he did decide to create some kind of false implication of Dalinar\u2019s guilt\u2026\r\nThe visions told me to trust him,Dalinar told himself firmly. But he was growing less certain about them. How much dared he risk on what they\u2019d said?\r\n\u201CYour soldiers are quite loyal to you,\u201D Sadeas noted as he arrived.\r\n\u201CLoyalty is the first lesson of a soldier\u2019s life,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CI would be worried if these men\r\nhadn\u2019tyet mastered it.\u201D\r\nSadeas sighed. \u201CReally, Dalinar. Must you always be so sanctimonious?\u201D\r\nDalinar didn\u2019t reply.\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s odd, how a leader\u2019s influence can affect his men,\u201D Sadeas said. \u201CSo many of these are like smaller versions of you. Bundles of emotion, wrapped up and tied until they become stiff from the pressure. They\u2019re so sure in some ways, yet so insecure in others.\u201D\r\nDalinar kept his jaw clenched.\r\nWhat is your game, Sadeas?\r\nSadeas smiled, leaning in, speaking softly. \u201CYou want so badly to snap at me, don\u2019t you? Even in the old days, you hated it when someone implied that you were insecure. Back then, your displeasure often ended with a head or two rolling across the stones.\u201D\r\n\u201CI killed many who did not deserve death,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CA man should not fear losing his head because he took one too many sips of wine.\u201D\r\n\u201CPerhaps,\u201D Sadeas said lightly. \u201CBut don\u2019t you ever want to let it out, as you used to? Doesn\u2019t it pound on you inside, like someone trapped within a\u00A0large drum? Beating, banging, trying to claw free?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D Dalinar said.\r\nThe admission seemed to surprise Sadeas. \u201CAnd the Thrill, Dalinar. Do you still feel the Thrill?\u201D\r\nMen didn\u2019t often speak of the Thrill, the joy and lust for battle. It was a private thing. \u201CI feel each of the things you mention, Sadeas,\u201D Dalinar said, eyes forward. \u201CBut I don\u2019t always let them out. A man\u2019s emotions are what define him, and control is the hallmark of true strength. To lack feeling is to be dead, but to act on every feeling is to be a child.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat has the stink of a quote about it, Dalinar. From Gavilar\u2019s little book of virtues, I assume?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes.\u201D\r\n\u201CDoesn\u2019t it bother you at all that the Radiants betrayed us?\u201D\r\n\u201CLegends. The Recreance is an event so old, it might as well be in the shadowdays. What did the Radiants really do? Why did they do it? We don\u2019t know.\u201D\r\n\u201CWe know enough. They used elaborate tricks to imitate great powers and pretend a holy calling. When their deceptions were discovered, they fled.\u201D\r\n\u201CTheir powers were not lies. They were real.\u201D\r\n\u201COh?\u201D Sadeas said, amused. \u201CYou know this? Didn\u2019t you just say the event was so old, it might as well have been in the shadowdays? If the Radiants had such marvelous powers, why can nobody reproduce them? Where did those incredible skills go?\u201D\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know,\u201D Dalinar said softly. \u201CPerhaps we\u2019re just not worthy of them any longer.\u201D\r\nSadeas snorted, and Dalinar wished he\u2019d bitten his tongue. His only evidence for what he said was his visions. And yet, if Sadeas belittled something, he instinctively wanted to stand up for it.\r\nI can\u2019t afford this. I need to be focused on the battle ahead.\r\n\u201CSadeas,\u201D he said, determined to change the topic. \u201CWe need to work harder to unify the warcamps. I want your help, now that you\u2019re Highprince of Information.\u201D\r\n\u201CTo do what?\u201D\r\n\u201CTo do what needs to be done. For the good of Alethkar.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m doing, old friend,\u201D Sadeas said. \u201CKilling Parshendi. Winning glory and wealth for our kingdom. Seeking vengeance. It would be best for Alethkar if you\u2019d stop wasting so much time in camp\u2014and stop talking of fleeing like cowards. It would be\r\nbestfor Alethkar if you\u2019d start acting like a man again.\u201D\r\n\u201CEnough, Sadeas!\u201D Dalinar said, more loudly than he\u2019d intended. \u201CI gave you leave to come along for your investigation, not to taunt me!\u201D\r\nSadeas sniffed. \u201CThat book ruined Gavilar. Now it\u2019s doing the same to you. You\u2019ve listened to those stories so much they\u2019ve got your head full of false ideals. Nobody ever really lived the way the Codes claim.\u201D\r\n\u201CBah!\u201D Dalinar said, waving a hand and turning Gallant. \u201CI don\u2019t have\u00A0time for your snideness today, Sadeas.\u201D He trotted his horse away, furious at Sadeas, then even more furious at himself for losing his temper.\r\nHe crossed the bridge, stewing, thinking of Sadeas\u2019s words. He found himself remembering a day when he stood with his brother beside the Impossible Falls of Kholinar.\r\nThings are different now, Dalinar,Gavilar had said.\r\nI see now, in ways I never did before. I wish I could show you what I mean.\r\nIt had been three days before his death.\r\nTen heartbeats.\r\nDalinar closed his eyes, breathing in and out\u2014slowly, calmingly\u2014as they prepared themselves behind the siege bridge. Forget Sadeas. Forget the visions. Forget his worries and fears. Just focus on the heartbeats.\r\nNearby, chulls scraped the rock with their hard, carapaced feet. The wind blew across his face, smelling wet. It always smelled wet out here, in these humid stormlands.\r\nSoldiers clanked, leather creaked. Dalinar raised his head toward the sky, his heart thumping deep within him. The brilliant white sun stained his eyelids red.\r\nMen shifted, called, cursed, loosened swords in their sheaths, tested bowstrings. He could\r\nfeeltheir tension, their anxiety mixed with excitement. Among them, anticipationspren began to spring from the ground, streamers connected by one side to the stone, the others whipping in the air. Some fearspren boiled up among them.\r\n\u201CAre you ready?\u201D Dalinar asked softly. The Thrill was rising within him.\r\n\u201CYes.\u201D Adolin\u2019s voice was eager.\r\n\u201CYou never complain about the way we attack,\u201D Dalinar said, eyes still closed. \u201CYou never challenge me on this.\u201D\r\n\u201CThis is the best way. They\u2019re my men too. What is the point of being a Shardbearer if we cannot lead the charge?\u201D\r\nThe tenth heartbeat sounded in Dalinar\u2019s chest; he could always hear the beats when he was summoning his Blade, no matter how loud the world around him was. The faster they passed, the sooner the blade arrived. So the more urgent you felt, the sooner you were armed. Was that intentional, or just some quirk of the Shardblade\u2019s nature?\r\nOathbringer\u2019s familiar weight settled into his hand.\r\n\u201CGo,\u201D Dalinar said, snapping his eyes open. He slammed his visor down as Adolin did the same, Stormlight rising from the sides as the helms sealed shut and became translucent. The two of them burst out from behind the massive bridge\u2014one Shardbearer on each side, a figure of blue and another of slate grey.\r\nThe energy of the armor pulsed through Dalinar as he dashed across the stone ground, arms pumping in rhythm with his steps. The wave of arrows came immediately, loosed from the Parshendi kneeling on the other side of the chasm. Dalinar flung his arm up in front of his eye slit as arrows sprayed across him, scraping metal, some shafts snapping. It felt like running against a hailstorm.\r\nAdolin bellowed a war cry from the right, voice muffled by his helm. As they approached the chasm lip, Dalinar lowered his arm despite the arrows. He needed to be able to judge his approach. The gulf was mere feet away. His Plate gave him a surge of strength as he reached the edge of the chasm.\r\nThen leaped.\r\nFor a moment, he soared above the inky chasm, cape flapping, arrows filling the air around him. He was reminded of the flying Radiant from his vision. But this was nothing so mystical, just a standard Shardplate-assisted jump. Dalinar cleared the chasm and crashed back to the ground on the other side, sweeping his Blade down and across to slay three Parshendi with a single blow.\r\nTheir eyes burned black and smoke rose as they collapsed. He swung again. Bits of armor and weapons sprayed into the air where arrows had once flown, sheared free by his Blade. As always, it sliced apart anything inanimate, but blurred when it touched flesh, as if turning to mist.\r\nThe way it reacted to flesh and cut steel so easily, it sometimes felt to Dalinar like he was swinging a weapon of pure smoke. As long as he kept the Blade in motion, it could not get caught in chinks or stopped by the weight of what it was cutting.\r\nDalinar spun, sweeping out with his Blade in a line of death. He sheared through souls themselves, leaving Parshendi to drop dead to the ground. Then he kicked, tossing a corpse into the faces of the Parshendi nearby. A few more kicks sent corpses flying\u2014a Plate-driven kick could easily send a body tumbling thirty feet\u2014clearing the ground around him for better footing.\r\nAdolin hit the plateau not far away, spinning and falling into Windstance. Adolin shoved his shoulder into a group of archers, tossing them backward and throwing several into the chasm. Gripping his Shardblade with both hands, he did an initial sweep as Dalinar had, cutting down six enemies.\r\nThe Parshendi were singing, many of them wearing beards that glowed with small uncut gemstones. Parshendi always sang as they fought; that song changed as they abandoned their bows\u2014pulling out axes, swords, or maces\u2014and threw themselves at the two Shardbearers.\r\nDalinar put himself at the optimal distance from Adolin, allowing his son to protect his blind spots, but not getting too close. The two Shardbearers fought, still near the lip of the chasm, cutting down the Parshendi who tried desperately to push them backward by sheer force of numbers. This was their best chance to defeat the Shardbearers. Dalinar and Adolin were alone, without their honor guard. A fall from this height would certainly kill even a man in Plate.\r\nThe Thrill rose within him, so sweet. Dalinar kicked away another corpse, though he didn\u2019t need the extra room. They\u2019d noticed that the Parshendi grew enraged when you moved their dead. He kicked another body, taunting them, drawing them toward him to fight in pairs as they often did.\r\nHe cut down a group that came, singing in voices angry at what he\u2019d done to their dead. Nearby, Adolin began to lay about him with punches as the Parshendi got too close; he was fond of the tactic, switching between using his sword in two hands or one. Parshendi corpses flew this way and that, bones and armor shattered by the blows, orange Parshendi blood spraying across the ground. Adolin moved back to his Blade a moment later, kicking away a corpse.\r\nThe Thrill consumed Dalinar, giving him strength, focus, and power. The glory of the battle grew grand. He\u2019d stayed away from this too long. He saw with clarity now. They\r\ndidneed to push harder, assault more plateaus, win the gemhearts.\r\nDalinar was the Blackthorn. He was a natural force, never to be halted. He was death itself. He\u2014\r\nHe felt a sudden stab of powerful revulsion, a sickness so strong that it made him gasp. He slipped, partially on a patch of blood, but partially because his knees grew suddenly weak.\r\nThe corpses before him suddenly seemed a horrifying sight. Eyes burned out like spent coals. Bodies limp and broken, bones shattered where Adolin had punched them. Heads cracked open, blood and brains and entrails spilled around them. Such butchery, such death. The Thrill vanished.\r\nHow could a man\r\nenjoythis?\r\nThe Parshendi surged toward him. Adolin was there in a heartbeat, attacking with more skill than any other man Dalinar had known. The lad was a genius with the Blade, an artist with paint of only one shade. He struck expertly, forcing the Parshendi back. Dalinar shook his head, recovering his stance.\r\nHe forced himself to resume fighting, and as the Thrill began to rise again, Dalinar hesitantly embraced it. The odd sickness faded, and his battle reflexes took control. He spun into the Parshendi advance, sweeping out with his Blade in broad, aggressive strokes.\r\nHe\r\nneededthis victory. For himself, for Adolin, and for his men. Why had he been so horrified? The Parshendi had murdered Gavilar. It was right to kill them.\r\nHe was a soldier. Fighting was what he did. And he did it well.\r\nThe Parshendi advance unit broke before his assault, scattering back toward a larger mass of their troops, who were forming ranks in haste. Dalinar stepped back and found himself looking down at the corpses around him, with their blackened eyes. Smoke still curled from a few.\r\nThe sick feeling returned.\r\nLife ended so quickly. The Shardbearer was destruction incarnate, the most powerful force on a battlefield.\r\nOnce these weapons meant protecting,a voice inside of him whispered.\r\nThe three bridges crashed to the ground a few feet away, and the cavalry charged across a moment later, led by compact Ilamar. A few windspren danced past in the air, nearly invisible. Adolin called for his horse, but Dalinar just stood, looking down at the dead. Parshendi blood was orange, and it smelled like mold. Yet their faces\u2014marbled black or white and red\u2014looked so human. A parshman nurse had practically raised Dalinar.\r\nLife before death.\r\nWhat\r\nwasthat voice?\r\nHe glanced back across the chasm, toward where Sadeas\u2014well outside of bow range\u2014sat with his attendants. Dalinar could sense the disapproval in his ex-friend\u2019s posture. Dalinar and Adolin risked themselves, taking a dangerous leap across the chasm. An assault of the type Sadeas had pioneered would cost more lives. But how many lives would Dalinar\u2019s army lose if one of its Shardbearers was pushed into the chasm?\r\nGallant charged across the bridge alongside a line of soldiers, who cheered for the Ryshadium. He slowed near Dalinar, who grabbed the reins. Right now, he was needed. His men were fighting and dying, and this was not a time for regret or second-guessing.\r\nA Plate-enhanced jump put him in the saddle. Then, Shardblade raised high, he charged into battle to kill for his men. That was not what the Radiants had fought for. But at least it was something.\r\nThey won the battle.\r\nDalinar stepped back, feeling fatigued as Adolin did the honors of harvesting the gemheart. The chrysalis itself sat like an enormous, oblong rockbud, fifteen feet tall and attached to the uneven stone ground by something that looked like crem. There were bodies all around it, some human, others Parshendi. The Parshendi had tried to get into it quickly and flee, but they\u2019d only managed to get a few cracks into the shell.\r\nThe fighting had been most furious here, around the chrysalis. Dalinar rested back against a shelf of rock and pulled his helm off, exposing a sweaty head to the cool breeze. The sun was high overhead; the battle had lasted two hours or so.\r\nAdolin worked efficiently, using his Shardblade with care to shave off a section of the outside of the chrysalis. Then he expertly plunged it in, killing the pupating creature but avoiding the region with the gemheart.\r\nJust like that, the creature was dead. Now the Shardblade could cut it, and Adolin carved away sections of flesh. Purple ichor spurted out as he reached in, questing for the gemheart. The soldiers cheered as he pulled it free, gloryspren hovering above the entire army like hundreds of spheres of light.\r\nDalinar found himself walking away, helm held in his left hand. He crossed the battlefield, passing surgeons tending the wounded and teams who were carrying his dead back to the bridges. There were sleds behind the chull carts for them, so they could be burned properly back at camp.\r\nThere were a lot of Parshendi corpses. Looking at them now, he was neither disgusted nor excited. Just exhausted.\r\nHe\u2019d gone to battle dozens, perhaps hundreds of times. Never before had he felt as he had this day. That revulsion had distracted him, and that could have gotten him killed. Battle was no time for reflection; you had to\u00A0keep your mind on what you were doing.\r\nThe Thrill had seemed subdued the entire battle, and he hadn\u2019t fought nearly as well as he once had. This battle should have brought him clarity. Instead, his troubles seemed magnified.\r\nBlood of my fathers,he thought, stepping up to the top of a small rock hill.\r\nWhat is happening to me?\r\nHis weakness today seemed the latest, and most potent, argument to fuel what Adolin\u2014and, indeed, what many others\u2014said about him. He stood atop the hill, looking eastward, toward the Origin. His eyes went that direction so often. Why? What was\u2014\r\nHe froze, noticing a group of Parshendi on a nearby plateau. His scouts watched them warily; it was the army that Dalinar\u2019s people had driven off. Though they\u2019d killed a lot of Parshendi today, the vast majority had still escaped, retreating when they realized the battle was lost to them. That was one of the reasons the war was lasting so long. The Parshendi understood strategic retreat.\r\nThis army stood in ranks, grouped in warpairs. A commanding figure stood at their head, a large Parshendi in glittering armor. Shardplate. Even at a distance, it was easy to tell the difference between it and something more mundane.\r\nThat Shardbearer hadn\u2019t been here during the battle itself. Why come now? Had he arrived too late?\r\nThe armored figure and the rest of the Parshendi turned and left, leaping across the chasm behind them and fleeing back toward their unseen haven at the center of the Plains."

      "ChapterName": "27: CHASM DUTY",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\nIf anything I have said makes a glimmer of sense to you, I trust that you\u2019ll call them off. Or maybe you could astound me and ask them to do something productive for once.\r\nKaladin pushed his way into the apothecary\u2019s shop, the door banging shut behind him. As before, the aged man pretended to be feeble, feeling his way with a cane until he recognized Kaladin. Then he stood up straighter. \u201COh. It\u2019s you.\u201D\r\nIt had been two more long days. Daytime spent working and training\u2014Teft and Rock now practiced with him\u2014evenings spent at the first chasm, retrieving the reeds from their hiding place in a crevice and then milking for hours. Gaz had seen them go down last night, and the bridge sergeant was undoubtedly suspicious. There was no helping that.\r\nBridge Four had been called out on a bridge run today. Thankfully, they\u2019d arrived before the Parshendi, and none of the bridge crews had lost any men. Things hadn\u2019t gone so well for the regular Alethi troops. The Alethi line had eventually buckled before the Parshendi assault, and the bridge crews had been forced to lead a tired, angry, and defeated troop of soldiers back to the camp.\r\nKaladin was bleary-eyed with fatigue from staying up late working on the reeds. His stomach growled perpetually from being given a fraction of the food it needed, as he shared his meals with two wounded. That all ended today. The apothecary walked back behind his counter, and Kaladin stepped up to it. Syl darted into the room, her small ribbon of light turning into a woman midtwist. She flipped like an acrobat, landing on the table in a smooth motion.\r\n\u201CWhat do you need?\u201D the apothecary asked. \u201CMore bandages? Well, I might just\u2014\u201D\r\nHe cut off as Kaladin slapped a medium-sized liquor bottle down on the table. It had a cracked top, but would still hold a cork. He pulled this free, revealing the milky white knobweed sap inside. He\u2019d used the first of what they\u2019d harvested to treat Leyten, Dabbid, and Hobber.\r\n\u201CWhat\u2019s this?\u201D the elderly apothecary asked, adjusting his spectacles and leaning down. \u201COffering me a drink? I don\u2019t take the stuff these days. Unsettles the stomach, you know.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s not liquor. It\u2019s knobweed sap. You said it was expensive. Well, how much will you give me for this?\u201D\r\nThe apothecary blinked, then leaned in closer, giving the contents a whiff. \u201CWhere\u2019d you get this?\u201D\r\n\u201CI harvested it from the reeds growing outside of camp.\u201D\r\nThe apothecary\u2019s expression darkened. He shrugged. \u201CWorthless, I\u2019m afraid.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat?\u201D\r\n\u201CThe wild weeds aren\u2019t potent enough.\u201D The apothecary replaced the cork. A strong wind buffeted the building, blowing under the door, stirring the scents of the many powders and tonics he sold. \u201CThis is practically useless. I\u2019ll give you two clearmarks for it, which is being generous. I\u2019ll have to distill it, and will be lucky to get a couple of spoonfuls.\u201D\r\nTwo marks!Kaladin thought with despair.\r\nAfter three days of work, three of us pushing ourselves, getting only a few hours of sleep each night? All for something worth only a couple days\u2019 wage?\r\nBut no. The sap had\r\nworkedon Leyten\u2019s wound, making the rotspren flee and the infection retreat. Kaladin narrowed his eyes as the apothecary fished two marks out of his money pouch, setting them on the table. Like many spheres, these were flattened slightly on one side to keep them from rolling away.\r\n\u201CActually,\u201D the apothecary said, rubbing his chin. \u201CI\u2019ll give you three.\u201D He took out one more mark. \u201CHate to see all of your effort go to waste.\u201D\r\n\u201CKaladin,\u201D Syl said, studying the apothecary. \u201CHe\u2019s nervous about something. I think he\u2019s lying!\u201D\r\n\u201CI know,\u201D Kaladin said.\r\n\u201CWhat\u2019s that?\u201D the apothecary said. \u201CWell, if you knew it was worthless, why did you spend so much effort on it?\u201D He reached for the bottle.\r\nKaladin caught his hand. \u201CWe got two or more drops from each reed, you know.\u201D\r\nThe apothecary frowned.\r\n\u201CLast time,\u201D Kaladin said, \u201Cyou told me I\u2019d be lucky to get one drop per reed. You said that was why knobweed sap was so expensive. You said nothing about \u2018wild\u2019 plants being weaker.\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d go and try gathering them, and\u2026\u201D He trailed off as Kaladin locked eyes with him.\r\n\u201CThe army doesn\u2019t know, do they?\u201D Kaladin asked. \u201CThey aren\u2019t aware how valuable those plants outside are. You harvest them, you sell the sap, and you make a killing, since the military needs a\r\nlotof antiseptic.\u201D\r\nThe old apothecary cursed, pulling his hand back. \u201CI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201D\r\nKaladin took his jar. \u201CAnd if I go to the healing tent and tell them where I got this?\u201D\r\n\u201CThey\u2019d take it from you!\u201D the man said urgently. \u201CDon\u2019t be a fool. You\u2019ve a slave brand, boy. They\u2019ll think you stole it.\u201D\r\nKaladin moved to walk away.\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll give a skymark,\u201D the apothecary said. \u201CThat\u2019s half what I\u2019d charge the military for this much.\u201D\r\nKaladin turned. \u201CYou charge them\r\ntwo skymarksfor something that only takes a couple of days to gather?\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s not just me,\u201D the apothecary said, scowling. \u201CEach of the apothecaries charges the same. We got together, decided on a fair price.\u201D\r\n\u201CHow is\r\nthata fair price?\u201D\r\n\u201CWe have to make a living here, in this Almighty-forsaken land! It costs us money to set up shop, to maintain ourselves, to hire guards.\u201D\r\nHe fished in his pouch, pulling out a sphere that glowed deep blue. A sapphire sphere was worth about twenty-five times a diamond one. As Kaladin made one diamond mark a day, a skymark was worth as much as Kaladin made in half a month. Of course, a common darkeyed soldier earned five clearmarks a day, which would make this a week\u2019s wages to them.\r\nOnce, this wouldn\u2019t have seemed like much money to Kaladin. Now it was a fortune. Still, he hesitated. \u201CI should expose you. Men die because of you.\u201D\r\n\u201CNo they don\u2019t,\u201D the apothecary said. \u201CThe highprinces have more than enough to pay this, considering what they make on the plateaus. We supply them with bottles of sap as often as they need them. All you\u2019d do by exposing us is let monsters like Sadeas keep a few more spheres in their pockets!\u201D\r\nThe apothecary was sweating. Kaladin was threatening to topple his entire business on the Shattered Plains. And so much money was being earned on the sap that this could grow\r\nverydangerous. Men killed to keep such secrets.\r\n\u201CLine my pocket or line the brightlords\u2019,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CI guess I can\u2019t argue with that logic.\u201D He set the bottle back on the counter. \u201CI\u2019ll take the deal, provided you throw in some more bandages.\u201D\r\n\u201CVery well,\u201D the apothecary said, relaxing. \u201CBut stay away from those reeds. I\u2019m surprised you found any nearby that hadn\u2019t already been harvested. My workers are having an increasingly difficult time.\u201D\r\nThey don\u2019t have a windspren guiding them,Kaladin thought. \u201CThen why would you want to discourage me? I could get more of this for you.\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, yes,\u201D the apothecary said. \u201CBut\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s cheaper if you do it yourself,\u201D Kaladin said, leaning down. \u201CBut this way you have a clean trail. I provide the sap, charging one skymark. If the lighteyes ever discover what the apothecaries have been doing, you can claim ignorance\u2014all you know is that some bridgeman was selling you sap, and you resold it to the army at a reasonable markup.\u201D\r\nThat seemed to appeal to the old man. \u201CWell, perhaps I won\u2019t ask too many questions about how you harvested this. Your business, young man. Your business indeed\u2026.\u201D He shuffled to the back of his store, returning with a box of bandages. Kaladin accepted it and left the shop without a word.\r\n\u201CAren\u2019t you worried?\u201D Syl said, floating up beside his head as he entered the afternoon sunlight. \u201CIf Gaz discovers what you\u2019re doing, you could get into trouble.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat more could they do to me?\u201D Kaladin asked. \u201CI doubt they\u2019d consider this a crime worth stringing me up for.\u201D\r\nSyl looked backward, forming into little more than a cloud with the faint suggestion of a female form. \u201CI can\u2019t decide if it\u2019s dishonest or not.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s not dishonest; it\u2019s business.\u201D He grimaced. \u201CLavis grain is sold the same way. Grown by the farmers and sold at a pittance to merchants, who carry it to the cities and sell it to other merchants, who sell it to people for four or five times what it was originally bought for.\u201D\r\n\u201CSo why did it bother you?\u201D Syl asked, frowning as they avoided a troop of soldiers, one of whom tossed the pit of a palafruit at Kaladin\u2019s head. The soldiers laughed.\r\nKaladin rubbed his temple. \u201CI\u2019ve still got some strange scruples about charging for medical care because of my father.\u201D\r\n\u201CHe sounds like he\u2019s a very generous man.\u201D\r\n\u201CFor all the good it did him.\u201D\r\nOf course, in a way, Kaladin was just as bad. During his early days as a slave, he\u2019d have done almost anything for a chance to walk around unsupervised like this. The army perimeter was guarded, but if he could sneak the knobweed in, he could probably find a way to sneak himself out.\r\nWith that sapphire mark, he even had money to aid him. Yes, he had the slave brand, but some quick if painful work with a knife could turn that into a \u201Cbattle scar\u201D instead. He could talk and fight like a soldier, so it would be plausible. He\u2019d be taken for a deserter, but he could live with that.\r\nThat had been his plan for most of the later months of his enslavement, but he\u2019d never had the means. It took money to travel, to get far enough away from the area where his description would be in circulation. Money to buy lodging in a seedy section of town, a place where nobody asked questions, while he healed from his self-inflicted wound.\r\nIn addition, there had always been the others. So he\u2019d stayed, trying to get as many out as he could. Failing every time. And he was doing it again.\r\n\u201CKaladin?\u201D Syl asked from his shoulder. \u201CYou look very serious. What are you thinking?\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m wondering if I should run. Escape this storm-cursed camp and find myself a new life.\u201D\r\nSyl fell silent. \u201CLife is hard here,\u201D she finally said. \u201CI don\u2019t know if anyone would blame you.\u201D\r\nRock would,he thought.\r\nAnd Teft.They\u2019d worked for that knobweed sap. They didn\u2019t know what it was worth; they thought it was only for healing the sick. If he ran, he\u2019d be betraying them. He\u2019d be abandoning the bridgemen.\r\nShove over, you fool,Kaladin thought to himself.\r\nYou won\u2019t save these bridgemen. Just like you didn\u2019t save Tien. You should run.\r\n\u201CAnd then what?\u201D he whispered.\r\nSyl turned to him. \u201CWhat?\u201D\r\nIf he ran, what good would it do? A life working for chips in the underbelly of some rotting city? No.\r\nHe couldn\u2019t leave them. Just like he\u2019d never been able to leave anyone who he\u2019d thought needed him. He had to protect them. He\r\nhadto.\r\nFor Tien. And for his own sanity.\r\n\u201CChasm duty,\u201D Gaz said, spitting to the side. The spittle was colored black from the yamma plant he chewed.\r\n\u201CWhat?\u201D Kaladin had returned from selling the knobweed to discover that Gaz had changed Bridge Four\u2019s work detail. They weren\u2019t scheduled to be on duty for any bridge runs\u2014their run the day before exempted them. Instead, they were supposed to be assigned to Sadeas\u2019s smithy to help lift ingots and other supplies.\r\nThat sounded like difficult work, but it was actually among the easiest jobs bridgemen got. The blacksmiths felt they didn\u2019t need the extra hands. That, or they presumed that clumsy bridgemen would just get in the way. On smithy duty, you usually only worked a few hours of the shift and could spend the rest lounging.\r\nGaz stood with Kaladin in the early afternoon sunlight. \u201CYou see,\u201D Gaz said, \u201Cyou got me thinking the other day. Nobody cares if Bridge Four is given unfair work details. Everyone hates chasm duty. I figured you wouldn\u2019t care.\u201D\r\n\u201CHow much did they pay you?\u201D Kaladin asked, stepping forward.\r\n\u201CStorm off,\u201D Gaz said, spitting again. \u201CThe others resent you. It\u2019ll do your crew good to be seen paying for what you did.\u201D\r\n\u201CSurviving?\u201D\r\nGaz shrugged. \u201CEveryone knows you broke the rules in bringing back those men. If the others do what you did, we\u2019d have each barrack filled with the dying before the leeward side of a month was over!\u201D\r\n\u201CThey\u2019re\r\npeople, Gaz. If we don\u2019t \u2018fill the barracks\u2019 with wounded, it\u2019s because we\u2019re leaving them out there to die.\u201D\r\n\u201CThey\u2019ll die here anyway.\u201D\r\n\u201CWe\u2019ll see.\u201D\r\nGaz watched him, eyes narrow. It seemed like he suspected that Kaladin had somehow tricked him in taking the stone-gathering duty. Earlier, Gaz had apparently gone down to the chasm, probably trying to figure out what Kaladin and the other two had been doing.\r\nDamnation,Kaladin thought. He\u2019d thought he had Gaz cowed enough to stay in line. \u201CWe\u2019ll go,\u201D Kaladin snapped, turning away. \u201CBut I\u2019m not taking the blame among my men for this one. They\u2019ll know you did it.\u201D\r\n\u201CFine,\u201D Gaz called after him. Then, to himself, he continued, \u201CMaybe I\u2019ll get lucky and a chasmfiend will eat the lot of you.\u201D\r\nChasm duty. Most bridgemen would rather spend all day hauling stones than get assigned to the chasms.\r\nWith an unlit oil-soaked torch tied to his back, Kaladin climbed down the precarious rope ladder. The chasm was shallow here, only about fifty feet down, but that was enough to take him into a different world. A world where the only natural light came from the rift high in the sky. A world that stayed damp on even the hottest days, a drowned landscape of moss, fungus, and hardy plants that survived in even dim light.\r\nThe chasms were wider at the bottom, perhaps a result of highstorms. They caused enormous floods to crash through the chasms; to be caught in a chasm during a highstorm was death. A sediment of hardened crem smoothed the pathway on the floor of the chasms, though it rose and fell with the varying erosion of the underlying rock. In some few places, the distance from the chasm floor to the edge of the plateau above was only about forty feet. In most places, however, it was closer to a hundred or more.\r\nKaladin jumped off the ladder, falling a few feet and landing with a splash in a puddle of rainwater. After lighting the torch, he held it high, peering along the caliginous rift. The sides were slick with a dark green moss, and several thin vines he didn\u2019t recognize trailed down from intermediate ledges above. Bits of bone, wood, and torn cloth lay strewn about or wedged into clefts.\r\nSomeone splashed to the ground beside him. Teft cursed, looking down at his soaked legs and trousers as he stepped out of the large puddle. \u201CStorms take that cremling Gaz,\u201D the aging bridgeman muttered. \u201CSending us down here when it isn\u2019t our turn. I\u2019ll have his beans for this.\u201D\r\n\u201CI am certain that he is very scared of you,\u201D Rock said, stepping down off the ladder onto a dry spot. \u201CIs probably back in camp crying in fear.\u201D\r\n\u201CStorm off,\u201D Teft said, shaking the water from his left leg. The two of them carried unlit torches. Kaladin lit his with a flint and steel, but the others did not. They needed to ration the torches.\r\nThe other men of Bridge Four began to gather near the bottom of the ladder, staying in a clump. Every fourth man lit his torch, but the light didn\u2019t do much to dispel the gloom; it just allowed Kaladin to see more of the unnatural landscape. Strange, tube-shaped fungi grew in cracks. They were a wan yellow, like the skin of a child with jaundice. Scuttling cremlings moved away from the light. The tiny crustaceans were a translucent reddish color; as one scrambled past on the wall, he realized that he could see its internal organs through its shell.\r\nThe light also revealed a twisted, broken figure at the base of the chasm wall a short distance away. Kaladin raised his torch and stepped up to it. It was beginning to stink already. He raised a hand, unconsciously covering his nose and mouth as he knelt down.\r\nIt was a bridgeman, or had been, from one of the other crews. He was fresh. If he\u2019d been here longer than a few days, the highstorm would have washed him away to some distant place. Bridge Four gathered behind Kaladin, looking silently at the one who had chosen to throw himself into the chasm.\r\n\u201CMay you someday find a place of honor in the Tranquiline Halls, fallen brother,\u201D Kaladin said, his voice echoing. \u201CAnd may we find a better end than you.\u201D He stood, holding his torch high, and led the way past the dead sentry. His crew followed nervously.\r\nKaladin had quickly understood the basic tactics of fighting on the Shattered Plains. You wanted to advance forcefully, pressing your enemy to the plateau\u2019s edge. That was why the battles often turned bloody for the Alethi, who usually arrived after the Parshendi.\r\nThe Alethi had bridges, while these odd Eastern parshmen could leap most chasms, given a running start. But both had trouble when squeezed toward the cliffs, and that generally resulted in soldiers losing their footing and tumbling into the void. The numbers were significant enough for the Alethi to want to recover lost equipment. And so bridgemen were sent on chasm duty. It was like barrow robbing, only without the barrows.\r\nThey carried sacks, and would spend hours walking around, looking for the corpses of the fallen, searching for anything of value. Spheres, breastplates, caps, weapons. Some days, when a plateau run was recent, they could try to make their way all the way out to where it had happened and scavenge from those bodies. But highstorms generally made that futile. Wait even a few days, and the bodies would be washed someplace else.\r\nBeyond that, the chasms were a bewildering maze, and getting to a specific contested plateau and then returning in a reasonable time was near impossible. General wisdom was to wait for a highstorm to push the bodies toward the Alethi side of the Plains\u2014highstorms always came east to west, after all\u2014and then send bridgemen down to search them out.\r\nThat meant a lot of random wandering. But over the years, enough bodies had fallen that it wasn\u2019t too difficult to find places to harvest. The crew was required to bring up a specific amount of salvage or face docked pay for the week, but the quota wasn\u2019t onerous. Enough to keep the bridgemen working, but not enough to force them to fully exert themselves. Like most bridgeman work, this was meant to keep them occupied as much as anything else.\r\nAs they walked down the first chasm, some of his men got out their sacks and picked up pieces of salvage they passed. A helmet here, a shield there. They kept a keen watch for spheres. Finding a valuable fallen sphere would result in a small reward for the whole crew. They weren\u2019t allowed to bring their own spheres or possessions into the chasm, of course. And on their way out, they were searched thoroughly. The humiliation of that search\u2014which included any place a sphere might be hidden\u2014was part of the reason chasm duty was so loathed.\r\nBut only a part. As they walked, the chasm floor widened to about fifteen feet. Here, marks scarred the walls, gashes where the moss had been scraped away, the stone itself scored. The bridgemen tried not to look at those marks. Occasionally, chasmfiends stalked these pathways, searching for either carrion or a suitable plateau to pupate upon. Encountering one of them was uncommon, but possible.\r\n\u201CKelek, but I hate this place,\u201D Teft said, walking beside Kaladin. \u201CI heard that once an entire bridge crew got eaten by a chasmfiend, one at a time, after it backed them into a dead end. It just sat there, picking them off as they tried to run past.\u201D\r\nRock chuckled. \u201CIf they were all eaten, then who was returning to tell this story?\u201D\r\nTeft rubbed his chin. \u201CI dunno. Maybe they just never returned.\u201D\r\n\u201CThen perhaps they fled. Deserting.\u201D\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D Teft said. \u201CYou can\u2019t get out of these chasms without a ladder.\u201D He glanced upward, toward the narrow rift of blue seventy feet above, following the curve of the plateau.\r\nKaladin glanced up as well. That blue sky seemed so distant. Unreachable. Like the light of the Halls themselves. And even if you could climb out at one of the shallower areas, you\u2019d either be trapped on the Plains without a way to cross chasms, or you\u2019d be close enough to the Alethi side that the scouts would spot you crossing the permanent bridges. You could try going eastward, toward where the plateaus were worn away to the point that they were just spires. But that would take weeks of walking, and would require surviving multiple highstorms.\r\n\u201CYou ever been in a slot canyon when rains come, Rock?\u201D Teft asked, perhaps thinking along the same lines.\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D Rock replied. \u201COn the Peaks, we have not these things. They only exist where foolish men choose to live.\u201D\r\n\u201C\r\nYoulive here, Rock,\u201D Kaladin noted.\r\n\u201CAnd I am foolish,\u201D the large Horneater said, chuckling. \u201CDid you not notice this thing?\u201D These last two days had changed him a great deal. He was more affable, returning in some measure to what Kaladin assumed was his normal personality.\r\n\u201CI was\r\ntalking,\u201D Teft said, \u201Cabout slot canyons. You want to guess what will happen if we get trapped down here in a highstorm?\u201D\r\n\u201CLots of water, I guess,\u201D Rock said.\r\n\u201CLots of water, looking to go any place it can,\u201D Teft said. \u201CIt gathers into enormous waves and goes crashing through these confined spaces with enough force to toss boulders. In fact, an\r\nordinaryrain will feel like a highstorm down here. A highstorm\u2026well, this would probably be the worst place in Roshar to be when one hits.\u201D\r\nRock frowned at that, glancing upward. \u201CBest not to be caught in the storm, then.\u201D\r\n\u201CYeah,\u201D Teft said.\r\n\u201CThough, Teft,\u201D Rock added, \u201Cit would give you bath, which you very much need.\u201D\r\n\u201CHey,\u201D Teft grumbled. \u201CIs that a comment on how I smell?\u201D\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D Rock said. \u201CIs comment on what\r\nIhave to smell. Sometimes, I am thinking that a Parshendi arrow in the eye would be better than smelling entire bridge crew enclosed in barrack at night!\u201D\r\nTeft chuckled. \u201CI\u2019d take offense at that if it weren\u2019t true.\u201D He sniffed at the damp, moldy chasm air. \u201CThis place ain\u2019t much better. It smells worse than a Horneater\u2019s boots in winter down here.\u201D He hesitated. \u201CEr, no offense. I mean personally.\u201D\r\nKaladin smiled, then glanced back. The thirty or so other bridgemen followed like ghosts. A few seemed to be edging close to Kaladin\u2019s group, as if trying to listen in without being obvious.\r\n\u201CTeft,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201C\u2018Smells worse than a Horneater\u2019s boots\u2019? How in the Halls isn\u2019t he supposed to take offense at\r\nthatphrase?\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s just an expression,\u201D Teft said, scowling. \u201CIt was out of my mouth before I realized what I was saying.\u201D\r\n\u201CAlas,\u201D Rock said, pulling a tuft of moss off the wall, inspecting it as they walked. \u201CYour insult has offended me. If we were at the Peaks, we would have to duel in the traditional\r\nalil\u2019tiki\u2019ifashion.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhich is what?\u201D Teft asked. \u201CWith spears?\u201D\r\nRock laughed. \u201CNo, no. We upon the Peaks are not barbarians like you down here.\u201D\r\n\u201CHow then?\u201D Kaladin asked, genuinely curious.\r\n\u201CWell,\u201D Rock said, dropping the moss and dusting off his hands, \u201Cis involving much mudbeer and singing.\u201D\r\n\u201CHow\u2019s\r\nthata duel?\u201D\r\n\u201CHe who can still sing after the most drinks is winner. Plus, soon, everyone is so drunk that they probably forget what argument was about.\u201D\r\nTeft laughed. \u201CBeats knives at dawn, I suppose.\u201D\r\n\u201CI guess that depends,\u201D Kaladin said.\r\n\u201CUpon what?\u201D Teft asked.\r\n\u201COn whether or not you\u2019re a knife merchant. Eh, Dunny?\u201D\r\nThe other two glanced to the side, where Dunny had moved up close to listen. The spindly youth jumped and blushed. \u201CEr\u2014I\u2014\u201D\r\nRock chuckled at Kaladin\u2019s words. \u201CDunny,\u201D he said to the youth. \u201CIs odd name. What is meaning of it?\u201D\r\n\u201CMeaning?\u201D Dunny asked. \u201CI don\u2019t know. Names don\u2019t always have a meaning.\u201D\r\nRock shook his head, displeased. \u201CLowlanders. How are you to know who you are if your name has no meaning?\u201D\r\n\u201CSo your name means something?\u201D Teft asked. \u201CNu\u2026ma\u2026nu\u2026\u201D\r\n\u201CNumuhukumakiaki\u2019aialunamor,\u201D Rock said, the native Horneater sounds flowing easily from his lips. \u201COf course. Is description of very special rock my father discovered the day before my birth.\u201D\r\n\u201CSo your name is a whole sentence?\u201D Dunny asked, uncertain\u2014as if he wasn\u2019t sure he belonged.\r\n\u201CIs poem,\u201D Rock said. \u201COn the Peaks, everyone\u2019s name is poem.\u201D\r\n\u201CIs that so?\u201D Teft said, scratching at his beard. \u201CMust make calling the family at mealtime a bit of a chore.\u201D\r\nRock laughed. \u201CTrue, true. Is also making for some interesting arguments. Usually, the best insults on the Peaks are in the form of a poem, one which is similar in composition and rhyme to the person\u2019s name.\u201D\r\n\u201CKelek,\u201D Teft muttered. \u201CSounds like a lot of work.\u201D\r\n\u201CIs why most arguments end in drinking, perhaps,\u201D Rock said.\r\nDunny smiled hesitantly. \u201CHey you big buffoon, you smell like a wet hog, so go out by the moon, and jump yourself in the bog.\u201D\r\nRock laughed riotously, his booming voice echoing down the chasm. \u201CIs good, is good,\u201D he said, wiping his eyes. \u201CSimple, but good.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat almost had the sound of a song to it, Dunny,\u201D Kaladin said.\r\n\u201CWell, it was the first thing that came to mind. I put it to the tune of \u2018Mari\u2019s Two Lovers\u2019 to get the beat right.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou can sing?\u201D Rock asked. \u201CI must be hearing.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut\u2014\u201D Dunny said.\r\n\u201CSing!\u201D Rock commanded, pointing.\r\nDunny yelped, but obeyed, breaking into a song that wasn\u2019t familiar to Kaladin. It was an amusing tale involving a woman and twin brothers who she thought were the same person. Dunny\u2019s voice was a pure tenor, and he seemed to have more confidence when he sang than when he spoke.\r\nHe was good. Once he moved to the second verse, Rock began humming in a deep voice, providing a harmony. The Horneater was obviously very practiced at song. Kaladin glanced back at the other bridgemen, hoping to pull some more into the conversation or the song. He smiled at Skar, but got only a scowl in return. Moash and Sigzil\u2014the dark-skinned Azish man\u2014wouldn\u2019t even look at him. Peet looked only at his feet.\r\nWhen the song was finished, Teft clapped appreciatively. \u201CThat\u2019s a better performance than I\u2019ve heard at many an inn.\u201D\r\n\u201CIs good to meet a lowlander who can sing,\u201D Rock said, stooping down to pick up a helm and stuff it in his bag. This particular chasm didn\u2019t seem to have much in the way of salvage this time. \u201CI had begun thinking you were all as tone deaf as my father\u2019s old axehound. Ha!\u201D\r\nDunny blushed, but seemed to walk more confidently.\r\nThey continued, occasionally passing turns or rifts in the stone where the waters had deposited large clusters of salvage. Here, the work turned more gruesome, and they\u2019d often have to pull out corpses or piles of bones to get what they wanted, gagging at the scent. Kaladin told them to leave the more sickening or rotted bodies for now. Rotspren tended to cluster around the dead. If they didn\u2019t find enough salvage later, they could get those on the way back.\r\nAt every intersection or branch, Kaladin made a white mark on the wall with a piece of chalk. That was the bridgeleader\u2019s duty, and he took it seriously. He wouldn\u2019t have his crew getting lost out in these rifts.\r\nAs they walked and worked, Kaladin kept the conversation going. He laughed\u2014forced himself to laugh\u2014with them. If that laugher felt hollow to him, the others didn\u2019t seem to notice. Perhaps they felt as he did, that even forced laughter was preferable to going back to the self-absorbed, mournful silence that cloaked most bridgemen.\r\nBefore long, Dunny was laughing and talking with Teft and Rock, his shyness faded. A few others hovered just behind\u2014Yake, Maps, a couple of others\u2014like wild creatures drawn to the light and warmth of a fire. Kaladin tried to draw them into the conversation, but it didn\u2019t work, so eventually he just let them be.\r\nEventually, they reached a place with a significant number of fresh corpses. Kaladin wasn\u2019t sure what combination of waterflow had made this section of chasm a good place for that\u2014it looked the same as other stretches. A little narrower perhaps. Sometimes they could go to the same nooks and find good salvage there; other times, those were empty, but other places would have dozens of corpses.\r\nThese bodies looked like they\u2019d floated in the wash of the highstorm flood, then been deposited as the water slowly receded. There were no Parshendi among them, and they were broken and torn from either their fall or the crush of the flood. Many were missing limbs.\r\nThe stink of blood and viscera hung in the humid air. Kaladin held his torch aloft as his companions fell silent. The dank chill kept the bodies from rotting too quickly, though the dampness counteracted some of that. The cremlings had begun chewing the skin off hands and gnawing out the eyes. Soon the stomachs would bloat with gas. Some rotspren\u2014tiny, red, translucent\u2014scrambled across the corpses.\r\nSyl floated down and landed on his shoulder, making disgusted noises. As usual, she offered no explanation for her absence.\r\nThe men knew what to do. Even with the rotspren, this was too rich a place to pass up. They went to work, pulling the corpses into a line so they could be inspected. Kaladin waved for Rock and Teft to join him as he picked up some stray bits of salvage that lay on the ground around the corpses. Dunny tagged along.\r\n\u201CThose bodies wear the highprince\u2019s colors,\u201D Rock noted as Kaladin picked up a dented steel cap.\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll bet they\u2019re from that run a few days back,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CIt went badly for Sadeas\u2019s forces.\u201D\r\n\u201C\r\nBrightlordSadeas,\u201D Dunny said. Then he ducked his head in embarrassment. \u201CSorry, I didn\u2019t mean to correct you. I used to forget to say the title. My master beat me when I did.\u201D\r\n\u201CMaster?\u201D Teft asked, picking up a fallen spear and pulling some moss off its shaft.\r\n\u201CI was an apprentice. I mean, before\u2026\u201D Dunny trailed off, then looked away.\r\nTeft had been right; bridgemen didn\u2019t like talking about their pasts. Anyway, Dunny was probably right to correct him. Kaladin would be punished if he were heard omitting a lighteyes\u2019s honorific.\r\nKaladin put the cap in his sack, then rammed his torch into a gap between two moss-covered boulders and started helping the others get the bodies into a line. He didn\u2019t prod the men toward conversation. The fallen deserved some reverence\u2014if that was possible while robbing them.\r\nNext, the bridgemen stripped the fallen of their armor. Leather vests from the archers, steel breastplates from the foot soldiers. This group included a lighteyes in fine clothing beneath even finer armor. Sometimes the bodies of fallen lighteyes would be recovered from the chasms by special teams so the corpse could be Soulcast into a statue. Darkeyes, unless they were very wealthy, were burned. And most soldiers who fell into the chasms were ignored; the men in camp spoke of the chasms being hallowed resting places, but the truth was that the effort to get the bodies out wasn\u2019t worth the cost or the danger.\r\nRegardless, to find a lighteyes here meant that his family hadn\u2019t been wealthy enough, or concerned enough, to send men out to recover him. His face was crushed beyond recognition, but his rank insignia identified him as seventh dahn. Landless, attached to a more powerful officer\u2019s retinue.\r\nOnce they had his armor, they pulled daggers and boots off everyone in line\u2014boots were\r\nalwaysin demand. They left the fallen their clothing, though they took off the belts and cut free many shirt buttons. As they worked, Kaladin sent Teft and Rock around the bend to see if there were any other bodies nearby.\r\nOnce the armor, weapons, and boots had been separated, the most grisly task began: searching pockets and pouches for spheres and jewelry. This pile was the smallest of the lot, but valuable. They didn\u2019t find any broams, which meant no pitiful reward for the bridgemen.\r\nAs the men performed their morbid task, Kaladin noticed the end of a spear poking out of a nearby pool. It had gone unnoticed in their initial sweep.\r\nLost in thought, he fetched it, shaking off the water, carrying it over to the weapons pile. He hesitated there, holding the spear over the pile with one hand, cold water dripping from it. He rubbed his finger along the smooth wood. He could tell from the heft, balance, and sanding that it was a good weapon. Sturdy, well made, well kept.\r\nHe closed his eyes, remembering days as a boy holding a quarterstaff.\r\nWords spoken by Tukks years ago returned to him, words spoken on that bright summer day when he\u2019d first held a weapon in Amaram\u2019s army.\r\nThe first step is to care,Tukks\u2019s voice seemed to whisper.\r\nSome talk about being emotionless in battle. Well, I suppose it\u2019s important to keep your head. But I hate that feeling of killing while calm and cold. I\u2019ve seen that those whocare\r\nfight harder, longer, and better than those who don\u2019t. It\u2019s the difference between mercenaries and real soldiers. It\u2019s the difference between fighting to defend your homeland and fighting on foreign soil.\r\nIt\u2019s good to care when you fight, so long as you don\u2019t let it consume you. Don\u2019t try to stop yourself from feeling. You\u2019ll hate who you become.\r\nThe spear quivered in Kaladin\u2019s fingers, as if begging him to swing it, spin it, dance with it.\r\n\u201CWhat are you planning to do, lordling?\u201D a voice called. \u201CGoing to ram that spear into your own gut?\u201D\r\nKaladin glanced up at the speaker. Moash\u2014still one of Kaladin\u2019s biggest detractors\u2014stood near the line of corpses. How had he known to call Kaladin \u201Clordling\u201D? Had he been talking to Gaz?\r\n\u201CHe claims he\u2019s a deserter,\u201D Moash said to Narm, the man working next to him. \u201CSays he was some important soldier, a squadleader or the like. But Gaz says that\u2019s all stupid boasting. They wouldn\u2019t send a man to the bridges if he actually knew how to fight.\u201D\r\nKaladin lowered the spear.\r\nMoash smirked, turning back to his work. Others, however, had now noticed Kaladin. \u201CLook at him,\u201D Sigzil said. \u201CHo, bridgeleader! You think that you\u2019re grand? That you are better than us? You think pretending that we\u2019re your own personal troop of soldiers will change anything?\u201D\r\n\u201CLeave him alone,\u201D Drehy said. He shoved Sigzil as he passed. \u201CAt least he tries.\u201D\r\nEarless Jacks snorted, pulling a boot free from a dead foot. \u201CHe cares about looking important. Even if he\r\nwasin the army, I\u2019ll bet he spent his days cleaning out latrines.\u201D\r\nIt appeared that there was something that would pull the bridgemen out of their silent stupors: loathing for Kaladin. Others began talking, calling gibes.\r\n\u201C\u2026his fault we\u2019re down here\u2026\u201D\r\n\u201C\u2026wants to run us ragged during our only free time, just so he can feel important\u2026\u201D\r\n\u201C\u2026sent us to carry rocks to show us he could shove us around\u2026\u201D\r\n\u201C\u2026bet he\u2019s never held a spear in his life.\u201D\r\nKaladin closed his eyes, listening to their scorn, rubbing his fingers on the wood.\r\nNever held a spear in his life.Maybe if he\u2019d never picked up that first spear, none of this would have happened.\r\nHe felt the smooth wood, slick with rainwater, memories jumbling in his head. Training to forget, training to get vengeance, training to learn and make sense of what had happened.\r\nWithout thinking about it, he snapped the spear up under his arm into a guard position, point down. Water droplets from its length sprayed across his back.\r\nMoash cut off in the middle of another gibe. The bridgemen sputtered to a stop. The chasm became quiet.\r\nAnd Kaladin was in another place.\r\nHe was listening to Tukks chide him.\r\nHe was listening to Tien laugh.\r\nHe was hearing his mother tease him in her clever, witty way.\r\nHe was on the battlefield, surrounded by enemies but ringed by friends.\r\nHe was listening to his father tell him with a sneer in his voice that spears were only for killing. You could not kill to protect.\r\nHe was alone in a chasm deep beneath the earth, holding the spear of a fallen man, fingers gripping the wet wood, a faint dripping coming from somewhere distant.\r\nStrength surged through him as he spun the spear up into an advanced kata. His body moved of its own accord, going through the forms he\u2019d trained in so frequently. The spear danced in his fingers, comfortable, an extension of himself. He spun with it, swinging it around and around, across his neck, over his arm, in and out of jabs and swings. Though it had been months since he\u2019d even held a weapon, his muscles knew what to do. It was as if the\r\nspear itselfknew what to do.\r\nTension melted away, frustration melted away, and his body sighed in contentment even as he worked it furiously. This was familiar. This was welcome. This was what it had been created to do.\r\nMen had always told Kaladin that he fought like nobody else. He\u2019d felt it on the first day he\u2019d picked up a quarterstaff, though Tukks\u2019s advice had helped him refine and channel what he could do. Kaladin had\r\ncaredwhen he fought. He\u2019d never fought empty or cold. He fought to keep his men alive.\r\nOf all the recruits in his cohort, he had learned the quickest. How to hold the spear, how to stand to spar. He\u2019d done it almost without instruction. That had shocked Tukks. But why should it have? You were not shocked when a child knew how to breathe. You were not shocked when a skyeel took flight for the first time. You should not be shocked when you hand Kaladin Stormblessed a spear and he knows how to use it.\r\nKaladin spun through the last motions of the kata, chasm forgotten, bridgemen forgotten, fatigue forgotten. For a moment, it was just him. Him and the wind. He fought with her, and she laughed.\r\nHe snapped the spear back into place, holding the haft at the one-quarter position, spearhead down, bottom of the haft tucked underneath his arm, end rising back behind his head. He breathed in deeply, shivering.\r\nOh, how I\u2019ve missed that.\r\nHe opened his eyes. Sputtering torchlight revealed a group of stunned bridgemen standing in a damp corridor of stone, the walls wet and reflecting the light. Moash dropped a handful of spheres in stunned silence, staring at Kaladin with mouth agape. Those spheres plopped into the puddle at his feet, causing it to glow, but none of the bridgemen noticed. They just stared at Kaladin, who was still in a battle stance, half crouched, trails of sweat running down the sides of his face.\r\nHe blinked, realizing what he\u2019d done. If word got back to Gaz that he was playing around with spears\u2026Kaladin stood up straight and dropped the spear into the pile of weapons. \u201CSorry,\u201D he whispered to it, though he didn\u2019t know why. Then, louder, he said, \u201CBack to work! I don\u2019t want to be caught down here when night falls.\u201D\r\nThe bridgemen jumped into motion. Down the chasm corridor, he saw Rock and Teft. Had they seen the entire kata? Flushing, Kaladin hurried up to them. Syl landed on his shoulder, silent.\r\n\u201CKaladin, lad,\u201D Teft said reverently. \u201CThat was\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CIt was meaningless,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CJust a kata. Meant to work the muscles and make you practice the basic jabs, thrusts, and sweeps. It\u2019s a lot showier than it is useful.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CNo, really,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CCan you imagine a man swinging a spear around his neck like that in combat? He\u2019d be gutted in a second.\u201D\r\n\u201CLad,\u201D Teft said. \u201CI\u2019ve\r\nseenkatas before. But never one like that. The way you moved\u2026The speed, the grace\u2026And there was some sort of spren zipping around you, between your sweeps, glowing with a pale light. It was beautiful.\u201D\r\nRock started. \u201CYou could see that?\u201D\r\n\u201CSure,\u201D Teft said. \u201CNever seen a spren like that. Ask the other men\u2014I saw a few of them pointing.\u201D\r\nKaladin glanced at his shoulder, frowning at Syl. She sat primly, legs crossed and hands folded atop her knee, pointedly not looking at him.\r\n\u201CIt was nothing,\u201D Kaladin repeated.\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D Rock said. \u201CThat it certainly was not. Perhaps\r\nyoushould challenge Shardbearer. You could become brightlord!\u201D\r\n\u201CI\r\ndon\u2019twant to be a brightlord,\u201D Kaladin snapped, perhaps more harshly than he should have. The other two jumped. \u201CBesides,\u201D he added, looking away from them. \u201CI tried that once. Where\u2019s Dunny?\u201D\r\n\u201CWait,\u201D Teft said, \u201Cyou\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CWhere is Dunny?\u201D Kaladin said firmly, punctuating each word.\r\nStormfather. I need to keep my mouth shut.\r\nTeft and Rock shared a glance, then Teft pointed. \u201CWe found some dead Parshendi around the bend. Thought you\u2019d want to know.\u201D\r\n\u201CParshendi,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CLet\u2019s go look. Might have something valuable.\u201D He\u2019d never looted Parshendi bodies before; fewer of them fell into the chasms than Alethi.\r\n\u201CIs true,\u201D Rock said, leading the way, carrying a lit torch. \u201CThose weapons they have, yes, very nice. And gemstones in their beards.\u201D\r\n\u201CNot to mention the armor,\u201D Kaladin said.\r\nRock shook his head. \u201CNo armor.\u201D\r\n\u201CRock, I\u2019ve\r\nseentheir armor. They always wear it.\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, yes, but we cannot use this thing.\u201D\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t understand,\u201D Kaladin said.\r\n\u201CCome,\u201D Rock said, gesturing. \u201CIs easier than explaining.\u201D\r\nKaladin shrugged, and they rounded the corner, Rock scratching at his red-bearded chin. \u201CStupid hairs,\u201D he muttered. \u201CAh, to have it right again. A man is not proper man without proper beard.\u201D\r\nKaladin rubbed his own beard. One of these days, he\u2019d save up and buy a razor and be rid of the blasted thing. Or, well, probably not. His spheres would be needed elsewhere.\r\nThey rounded the corner and found Dunny pulling the Parshendi bodies into a line. There were four of them, and they looked like they\u2019d been swept in from another direction. There were a few more Alethi bodies here too.\r\nKaladin strode forward, waving Rock to bring the light, and knelt to inspect one of the Parshendi dead. They were like parshmen, with skin in marbled patterns of black and crimson. Their only clothing was knee-length black skirts. Three wore beards, which was unusual for parshmen, and those were woven with uncut gemstones.\r\nJust as Kaladin had expected, they wore armor of a pale red color. Breastplates, helms on the heads, guards on the arms and legs. Extensive armor for regular foot soldiers. Some of it was cracked from the fall or the wash. It wasn\u2019t metal, then. Painted wood?\r\n\u201CI thought you said they weren\u2019t armored,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CWhat are you trying to tell me? That you don\u2019t dare take it off the dead?\u201D\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t dare?\u201D Rock said. \u201CKaladin, Master Brightlord, brilliant bridgeleader, spinner of spear, perhaps\r\nyouwill get it off them.\u201D\r\nKaladin shrugged. His father had instilled in him a familiarity with the dead and dying, and though it felt bad to rob the dead, he was not squeamish. He prodded the first Parshendi, noting the man\u2019s knife. He took it and looked for the strap that held the shoulder guard in place.\r\nThere was no strap. Kaladin frowned and peered underneath the guard, trying to pry it up. The skin lifted with it. \u201CStormfather!\u201D he said. He inspected the helm. It was grown into the head. Or grown\r\nfromthe head. \u201CWhat\r\nisthis?\u201D\r\n\u201CDo not know,\u201D Rock said, shrugging. \u201CIt is looking like they grow their own armor, eh?\u201D\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s ridiculous,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CThey\u2019re just people. People\u2014even parshmen\u2014don\u2019t\r\ngrowarmor.\u201D\r\n\u201CParshendi do,\u201D Teft said.\r\nKaladin and the other two turned to him.\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t look at me like that,\u201D the older man said with a scowl. \u201CI worked in the camp for a few years before I ended up as a bridgeman\u2014no, I\u2019m not going to tell you how, so storm off. Anyway, the soldiers talk about it. The Parshendi grow carapaces.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve\r\nknownparshmen,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CThere were a couple of them in my hometown, serving the citylord. None of them grew armor.\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, these are a different kind of parshman,\u201D Teft said with a scowl. \u201CBigger, stronger. They can jump\r\nchasms, for Kelek\u2019s sake. And they grow armor. That\u2019s just how it is.\u201D\r\nThere was no disputing it, so they just moved on to gathering what they could. Many Parshendi used heavy weapons\u2014axes, hammers\u2014and those hadn\u2019t been carried along with the bodies like many of the spears and bows Alethi soldiers had. But they did find several knives and one ornate sword, still in a sheath at the Parshendi\u2019s side.\r\nThe skirts didn\u2019t have pockets, but the corpses did have pouches tied to their waists. These just carried flint and tinder, whetstones, or other basic supplies. So, they knelt to begin pulling the gemstones from the beards. Those gemstones had holes drilled through them to facilitate weaving, and Stormlight infused them, though they didn\u2019t glow as brightly as they would have if they\u2019d been properly cut.\r\nAs Rock pulled the gemstones out of the final Parshendi\u2019s beard, Kaladin held one of the knives up near Dunny\u2019s torch, inspecting the detailed carving. \u201CThose look like glyphs,\u201D he said, showing it to Teft.\r\n\u201CI can\u2019t read glyphs, boy.\u201D\r\nOh, right,Kaladin thought. Well, if they were glyphs, they weren\u2019t ones he was familiar with. Of course, you could draw most glyphs in complex ways that made it hard to read them, unless you knew exactly what to look for. There was a figure at the center of the hilt, nicely carved. It was a man in fine armor. Shardplate, certainly. A symbol was etched behind him, surrounding him, spreading out from his back like wings.\r\nKaladin showed it to Rock, who had walked up to see what he found so fascinating. \u201CThe Parshendi out here are supposed to be barbarians,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CWithout culture. Where did they get knives like these? I\u2019d swear this is a picture of one of the Heralds. Jezerezeh or Nalan.\u201D\r\nRock shrugged. Kaladin sighed and returned the knife to its sheath, then dropped it into his sack. Then they rounded the curve back to the others. The crew had gathered up sacks full of armor, belts, boots, and spheres. Each took up a spear to carry back to the ladder, holding them like walking sticks. They\u2019d left one for Kaladin, but he tossed it to Rock. He didn\u2019t trust himself to hold one of them again, worried he\u2019d be tempted to fall into another kata.\r\nThe walk back was uneventful, though with the darkening sky, the men began jumping at every sound. Kaladin engaged Rock, Teft, and Dunny in conversation again. He was able to get Drehy and Torfin to talk a little as well.\r\nThey safely reached the first chasm, much to the relief of his men. Kaladin sent the others up the ladder first, waiting to go up last. Rock waited with him, and as Dunny finally started up\u2014leaving Rock and Kaladin alone\u2014the tall Horneater put a hand on Kaladin\u2019s shoulder, speaking in a soft voice.\r\n\u201CYou do good work here,\u201D Rock said. \u201CI am thinking that in a few weeks, these men will be yours.\u201D\r\nKaladin shook his head. \u201CWe\u2019re bridgemen, Rock. We don\u2019t\r\nhavea few weeks. If I take that long winning them over, half of us will be dead.\u201D\r\nRock frowned. \u201CIs not a happy thought.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s why we have to win over the other men\r\nnow.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut how?\u201D\r\nKaladin looked up at the dangling ladder, shaking as the men climbed up. Only four could go at a time, lest they overload it. \u201CMeet me after we\u2019re searched. We\u2019re going to the camp market.\u201D\r\n\u201CVery well,\u201D Rock said, swinging onto the ladder as Earless Jaks reached the top. \u201CWhat will be our purpose in this thing?\u201D\r\n\u201CWe\u2019re going to try out my secret weapon.\u201D\r\nRock laughed as Kaladin held the ladder steady for him. \u201CAnd what weapon is this?\u201D\r\nKaladin smiled. \u201CActually, it\u2019s you.\u201D\r\nTwo hours later, at Salas\u2019s first violet light, Rock and Kaladin walked back into the lumberyard. It was just past sunset, and many of the bridgemen would soon be going to sleep.\r\nNot much time,Kaladin thought, gesturing for Rock to carry his burden to a place near the front of Bridge Four\u2019s barrack. The large Horneater set his burden down next to Teft and Dunny, who had done as Kaladin had ordered, building a small ring of stones and setting up some stumps of wood from the lumberyard scrap pile. That wood was free for anyone to take. Even bridgemen were allowed; some liked to take chunks to whittle.\r\nKaladin got out a sphere for light. The thing Rock had been carrying was an old iron cauldron. Even though it was secondhand, it had cost Kaladin a fair chunk of the knobweed sap money. The Horneater began to unpack supplies from inside the cauldron as Kaladin arranged some wood scraps inside the ring of stones.\r\n\u201CDunny, water, if you please,\u201D Kaladin said, getting out his flint. Dunny ran off to fetch a bucket from one of the rain barrels. Rock finished emptying the cauldron, laying out small packages that had cost another substantial portion of Kaladin\u2019s spheres. He had only a handful of clearchips left.\r\nAs they worked, Hobber limped out of the barrack. He was mending quickly, though the other two wounded that Kaladin had treated were still in bad shape.\r\n\u201CWhat are you up to, Kaladin?\u201D Hobber asked just as Kaladin got a flame started.\r\nKaladin smiled, standing. \u201CHave a seat.\u201D\r\nHobber did just that. He hadn\u2019t lost the near-devotion he\u2019d shown Kaladin for saving his life. If anything, his loyalty had grown stronger.\r\nDunny returned with a bucket of water, which he poured into the cauldron. Then he and Teft ran off to get more. Kaladin built up the flames and Rock began to hum to himself as he diced tubers and unwrapped some seasonings. In under a half hour, they had a roaring flame and a simmering pot of stew.\r\nTeft sat down on one of the stumps, warming his hands. \u201CThis is your secret weapon?\u201D\r\nKaladin sat down next to the older man. \u201CHave you known many soldiers in your life, Teft?\u201D\r\n\u201CA few.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou ever known any who could turn down a warm fire and some stew at the end of a hard day?\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, no. But bridgemen ain\u2019t soldiers.\u201D\r\nThat was true. Kaladin turned to the barrack doorway. Rock and Dunny started up a song together and Teft began to clap along. Some of the men from other bridge crews were up late, and they gave Kaladin and the others nothing more than scowls.\r\nFigures shifted inside the barrack, shadows moving. The door was open, and the scents of Rock\u2019s stew grew strong. Inviting.\r\nCome on,Kaladin thought.\r\nRemember why we live. Remember warmth, remember good food. Remember friends, and song, and evenings spent around the hearth.\r\nYou aren\u2019t dead yet. Storm you! If you don\u2019t come out\u2026\r\nIt all suddenly seemed so contrived to Kaladin. The singing was forced, the stew an act of desperation. It was all just an attempt to briefly distract from the pathetic life he had been forced into.\r\nA figure moved in the doorway. Skar\u2014short, square-bearded, and keen-eyed\u2014stepped out into the firelight. Kaladin smiled at him. A forced smile. Sometimes that was all one could offer.\r\nLet it be enough,he prayed, standing up, dipping a wooden bowl into Rock\u2019s stew.\r\nKaladin held the bowl toward Skar. Steam curled from the surface of the brownish liquid. \u201CWill you join us?\u201D Kaladin asked. \u201CPlease.\u201D\r\nSkar looked at him, then back down at the stew. He laughed, taking the stew. \u201CI\u2019d join the Nightwatcher herself around a fire if there was stew involved!\u201D\r\n\u201CBe careful,\u201D Teft said. \u201CThat\u2019s Horneater stew. Might be snail shells or crab claws floating in it.\u201D\r\n\u201CThere is not!\u201D Rock barked. \u201CIs unfortunate that you have unrefined lowlander tastes, but I prepare the food such as I am ordered by our dear bridgeleader.\u201D\r\nKaladin smiled, letting out a deep breath as Skar sat down. Others trailed out after him, taking bowls, sitting. Some stared into the fire, not saying much, but others began to laugh and sing. At one point, Gaz walked past, eyeing them with his single eye, as if trying to decide if they were breaking any camp regulations. They weren\u2019t. Kaladin had checked.\r\nKaladin dipped out a bowl of stew and held it toward Gaz. The bridge sergeant snorted in derision and stalked away.\r\nCan\u2019t expect too many miracles in one night,Kaladin thought with a sigh, settling back down and trying the stew. It was quite good. He smiled, joining in the next verse of Dunny\u2019s song.\r\nThe next morning, when Kaladin called for the bridgemen to rise, three-quarters of them piled out of the barrack\u2014everyone but the loudest complainers: Moash, Sigzil, Narm, and a couple of others. The ones who came to his call looked surprisingly refreshed, despite the long evening spent singing and eating. When he ordered them to join him in practice carrying the bridge, almost all of those who had risen joined him.\r\nNot everyone, but enough.\r\nHe had a feeling that Moash and the others would give in before too long. They\u2019d eaten his stew. Nobody had turned that down. And now that he had so many, the others would feel foolish not joining in. Bridge Four was his.\r\nNow he had to keep them alive long enough for that to mean something."

      "ChapterName": "28: DECISION",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\nFor I have never been dedicated to a more important purpose, and the very pillars of the sky will shake with the results of our war here. I ask again. Support me. Do not stand aside and let disaster consume more lives. I\u2019ve never begged you for something before, old friend. I do so now.\r\nAdolin was frightened.\r\nHe stood beside his father on the staging ground. Dalinar looked\u2026weathered. Creases running back from his eyes, furrows in his skin. Black hair going white like bleached rock along the sides. How could a man standing in full Shardplate\u2014a man who yet retained a warrior\u2019s frame despite his age\u2014look fragile?\r\nIn front of them, two chulls followed their handler, stepping up onto the bridge. The wooden span linked two piles of cut stones, a mock chasm only a few feet deep. The chulls\u2019 whiplike antennae twitched, mandibles clacking, fist-size black eyes glancing about. They pulled a massive siege bridge, rolling on creaking wooden wheels.\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s much wider than the bridges Sadeas uses,\u201D Dalinar said to Teleb, who stood beside them.\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s necessary to accommodate the siege bridge, Brightlord.\u201D\r\nDalinar nodded absently. Adolin suspected that he was the only one who could see that his father was distressed. Dalinar maintained his usual confident front, his head high, his voice firm when he spoke.\r\nYet, those eyes. They were too red, too strained. And when Adolin\u2019s father felt strained, he grew cold and businesslike. When he spoke to Teleb, his tone was too controlled.\r\nDalinar Kholin was suddenly a man laboring beneath great weight. And Adolin had helped put him there.\r\nThe chulls advanced. Their boulderlike shells were painted blue and yellow, the colors and pattern indicating the island of their Reshi handlers. The bridge beneath them groaned ominously as the larger siege bridge rolled onto it. All around the staging area, soldiers turned to look. Even the workmen cutting a latrine into the stony ground on the eastern side stopped to watch.\r\nThe groans from the bridge grew louder. Then they became sharp cracks. The handlers halted the chulls, glancing toward Teleb.\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s not going to hold, is it?\u201D Adolin asked.\r\nTeleb sighed. \u201CStorm it, I was hoping\u2026Bah, we made the smaller bridge too thin when we widened it. But if we make it thicker, it will get too heavy to carry.\u201D He glanced at Dalinar. \u201CI apologize for wasting your time, Brightlord. You are correct; this is akin to the ten fools.\u201D\r\n\u201CAdolin, what do you think?\u201D Dalinar asked.\r\nAdolin frowned. \u201CWell\u2026I think perhaps we should keep working with it. This is only the first attempt, Teleb. Perhaps there\u2019s still a way. Design the siege bridges to be narrower, maybe?\u201D\r\n\u201CThat could be very costly, Brightlord,\u201D Teleb said.\r\n\u201CIf it helps us win one extra gemheart, the effort would be paid for several times over.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D Teleb said, nodding. \u201CI will speak with Lady Kalana. Perhaps she can devise a new design.\u201D\r\n\u201CGood,\u201D Dalinar said. He stared at the bridge for an extended moment. Then, oddly, he turned to look toward the other side of the staging area, where the workers had been cutting the latrine ditch.\r\n\u201CFather?\u201D Adolin asked.\r\n\u201CWhy do you suppose,\u201D Dalinar said, \u201Cthere are no Shardplate-like suits for workmen?\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat?\u201D\r\n\u201CShardplate gives awesome strength, but we rarely use it for anything other than war and slaughter. Why did the Radiants fashion only weapons? Why didn\u2019t they make productive tools for use by ordinary men?\u201D\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know,\u201D Adolin said. \u201CPerhaps because war was the most important thing around.\u201D\r\n\u201CPerhaps,\u201D Dalinar said, voice growing softer. \u201CAnd perhaps that\u2019s a final condemnation of them and their ideals. For all of their lofty claims, they never gave their Plate or its secrets to the common people.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2026I don\u2019t understand why that\u2019s important, Father.\u201D\r\nDalinar shook himself slightly. \u201CWe should get on with our inspections. Where\u2019s Ladent?\u201D\r\n\u201CHere, Brightlord.\u201D A short man stepped up to Dalinar. Bald and bearded, the ardent wore thick, blue-grey layered robes from which his hands barely extended. The effect was of a crab who was too small for his shell. It looked terribly hot, but he didn\u2019t seem to mind.\r\n\u201CSend a messenger to the Fifth Battalion,\u201D Dalinar told him. \u201CWe\u2019ll be visiting them next.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes, Brightlord.\u201D\r\nAdolin and Dalinar began to walk. They\u2019d chosen to wear their Shardplate for this day\u2019s inspections. That wasn\u2019t uncommon; many Shardbearers found any excuse they could to wear Plate. Plus, it was good for the men to see their highprince and his heir in their strength.\r\nThey drew attention as they left the staging area and entered the warcamp proper. Like Adolin, Dalinar went about unhelmed, though the gorget of his armor was tall and thick, rising like a metal collar up to his chin. He nodded to soldiers who saluted.\r\n\u201CAdolin,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CIn combat, do you feel the Thrill?\u201D\r\nAdolin started. He knew immediately what his father meant, but he was shocked to hear the words. This wasn\u2019t often discussed. \u201CI\u2026Well, of course. Who doesn\u2019t?\u201D\r\nDalinar didn\u2019t reply. He had been so reserved lately. Was that pain in his eyes?\r\nThe way he was before,Adolin thought,\r\ndeluded but confident. That was actually better.\r\nDalinar said nothing more, and the two of them continued through the camp. Six years had let the soldiers settle in thoroughly. Barracks were painted with company and squad symbols, and the space between them was outfitted with firepits, stools, and canvas-shaded dining areas. Adolin\u2019s father had forbidden none of this, though he had set guidelines to discourage sloppiness.\r\nDalinar had also approved most requests for families to be brought to the Shattered Plains. The officers already had their wives, of course\u2014a good lighteyes officer was really a team, the man to command and fight, the woman to read, write, engineer, and manage camp. Adolin smiled, thinking of Malasha. Would she prove to be the one for him? She\u2019d been a little cold to him lately. Of course, there was Danlan. He\u2019d only just met her, but he was intrigued.\r\nRegardless, Dalinar had also approved requests by darkeyed common soldiers to bring their families. He even paid half of the cost. When Adolin had asked why, Dalinar had replied that he didn\u2019t feel right forbidding them. The warcamps were never attacked anymore, so there was no danger. Adolin suspected his father felt that since he was living in a luxurious near-palace, his men might as well have the comfort of their families.\r\nAnd so it was that children played and ran through the camp. Women hung wash and painted glyphwards as men sharpened spears and polished breastplates. Barrack interiors had been partitioned to create rooms.\r\n\u201CI think you were right,\u201D Adolin said as they walked, trying to draw his father out of his contemplations. \u201CTo let so many bring their families here, I mean.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes, but how many will leave when this is over?\u201D\r\n\u201CDoes it matter?\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m not certain. The Shattered Plains are now a de facto Alethi province. How will this place appear in a hundred years? Will those rings of barracks become neighborhoods? The outer shops become markets? The hills to the west become fields for planting?\u201D He shook his head. \u201CThe gemhearts will always be here, it seems. And so long as they are, there will be people here as well.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s a good thing, isn\u2019t it? So long as those people are Alethi.\u201D Adolin chuckled.\r\n\u201CPerhaps. And what will happen to the value of gemstones if we continue to capture gemhearts at the rate we have?\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2026\u201D That was a good question.\r\n\u201CWhat happens, I wonder, when the scarcest, yet most desirable, substance in the land suddenly becomes commonplace? There\u2019s much going on here, son. Much we haven\u2019t considered. The gemhearts, the Parshendi, the death of Gavilar. You will have to be ready to consider these things.\u201D\r\n\u201CMe?\u201D Adolin said. \u201CWhat does that mean?\u201D\r\nDalinar didn\u2019t answer, instead nodding as the commander of the Fifth Battalion hastened up to them and saluted. Adolin sighed and saluted back. The Twenty-first and Twenty-second Companies were doing close order drill here\u2014an essential exercise whose true value few outside the military ever appreciated. The Twenty-third and Twenty-fourth Companies were doing extended order\u2014or combat\u2014drill, practicing the formations and movements used on the battlefield.\r\nFighting on the Shattered Plains was very different from regular warfare, as the Alethi had learned from some embarrassing early losses. The Parshendi were squat, muscular, and had that strange, skin-grown armor of theirs. It didn\u2019t cover as fully as plate, but it was far more efficient than what most foot soldiers had. Each Parshendi was essentially an extremely mobile heavy infantryman.\r\nThe Parshendi always attacked in pairs, eschewing a regular line of battle. That should have made it easy for a disciplined line to defeat them. But each pair of Parshendi had such momentum\u2014and was so well armored\u2014that they could break right through a shield wall. Alternatively, their jumping prowess could suddenly deposit entire ranks of Parshendi behind Alethi lines.\r\nBeyond all that, there was that distinctive way they moved as a group in combat. They maneuvered with an inexplicable coordination. What had seemed at first to be mere barbarian savagery turned out to disguise something more subtle and dangerous.\r\nThey\u2019d found only two reliable ways to defeat the Parshendi. The first was to use a Shardblade. Effective, but of limited application. The Kholin army had only two Blades, and while Shards were incredibly powerful, they needed proper support. An isolated, outnumbered Shardbearer could be tripped and toppled by his adversaries. In fact, the one time Adolin had seen a full Shardbearer fall to a regular soldier, it had happened because he had been swarmed by spearmen who broke his breastplate. Then a lighteyed archer had slain him from fifty paces, winning the Shards for himself. Not exactly a heroic end.\r\nThe other reliable way to fight Parshendi depended on quick-moving formations. Flexibility mixed with discipline: flexibility to respond to the uncanny way Parshendi fought, discipline to maintain lines and make up for individual Parshendi strength.\r\nHavrom, Fifth Battalionlord, waited for Adolin and Dalinar with his companylords in a line. They saluted, right fists to right shoulders, knuckles outward.\r\nDalinar nodded to them. \u201CHave my orders been seen to, Brightlord Havrom?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes, Highprince.\u201D Havrom was built like a tower, and wore a beard with long sides after the Horneater fashion, chin clean-shaven. He had relatives among the Peakfolk. \u201CThe men you wanted are waiting in the audience tent.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat\u2019s this?\u201D Adolin asked.\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll show you in a moment,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CFirst, review the troops.\u201D\r\nAdolin frowned, but the soldiers were waiting. One company at a time, Havrom had the men fall in. Adolin walked before them, inspecting their lines and uniforms. They were neat and orderly, though Adolin knew that some of the soldiers in their army grumbled at the level of polish required of them. He happened to agree with them on that point.\r\nAt the end of the inspection, he questioned a few random men, asked their rank and if they had any specific concerns. None had any. Were they satisfied or just intimidated?\r\nWhen he was done, Adolin returned to his father.\r\n\u201CYou did that well,\u201D Dalinar said.\r\n\u201CAll I did was walk down a line.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes, but the presentation was good. The men know you care for their needs, and they respect you.\u201D He nodded, as if to himself. \u201CYou\u2019ve learned well.\u201D\r\n\u201CI think you\u2019re reading too much into a simple inspection, Father.\u201D\r\nDalinar nodded to Havrom, and the battalionlord led the two of them to an audience tent near the side of the practice field. Adolin, puzzled, glanced at his father.\r\n\u201CI had Havrom gather the soldiers that Sadeas spoke to the other day,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CThe ones he interviewed while we were on our way to the plateau assault.\u201D\r\n\u201CAh,\u201D Adolin said. \u201CWe\u2019ll want to know what he asked them.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D Dalinar said. He gestured for Adolin to enter before him, and they walked in\u2014tailed by a few of Dalinar\u2019s ardents. Inside, a group of ten soldiers waited on benches. They rose and saluted.\r\n\u201CAt ease,\u201D Dalinar said, clasping plated hands behind his back. \u201CAdolin?\u201D Dalinar nodded toward the men, indicating that Adolin should take the lead in the questioning.\r\nAdolin stifled a sigh. Again? \u201CMen, we need to know what Sadeas asked you and how you responded.\u201D\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t worry, Brightlord,\u201D said one of the men, speaking with a rural northern Alethi accent. \u201CWe didn\u2019t tell him nothing.\u201D\r\nThe others nodded vigorously.\r\n\u201CHe\u2019s an eel, and we know it,\u201D another added.\r\n\u201CHe is a highprince,\u201D Dalinar said sternly. \u201CYou will treat him with respect.\u201D\r\nThe soldier paled, then nodded.\r\n\u201CWhat,\r\nspecifically, did he ask you?\u201D Adolin asked.\r\n\u201CHe wanted to know our duties in the camp, Brightlord,\u201D the man said. \u201CWe\u2019re grooms, you see.\u201D\r\nEach soldier was trained in one or two additional skills beyond those of combat. Having a group of soldiers who could care for horses was useful, as it kept civilians from plateau assaults.\r\n\u201CHe asked around,\u201D said one of the men. \u201COr, well, his people did. Found out we were in charge of the king\u2019s horse during the chasmfiend hunt.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut we didn\u2019t say nothing,\u201D the first soldier repeated. \u201CNothing to get you into trouble, sir. We\u2019re not going to give that ee\u2014er, that highprince, Brightlord sir, the rope to hang you, sir.\u201D\r\nAdolin closed his eyes. If they had acted this way around Sadeas, it would have been more incriminating than the cut girth itself. He couldn\u2019t fault their loyalty, but they acted as if they assumed Dalinar\r\nhaddone something wrong, and needed to defend him.\r\nHe opened his eyes. \u201CI spoke to some of you before, I recall. But let me ask again. Did any of you see a cut strap on the king\u2019s saddle?\u201D\r\nThe men looked at each other, shaking heads. \u201CNo, Brightlord,\u201D one of the men replied. \u201CIf we\u2019d seen it, we\u2019d have changed it, right we would.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut, Brightlord,\u201D one of the men added, \u201Cthere was a lot of confusion that day, and a lot of people. Wasn\u2019t a right regular plateau assault or nothing like that. And, well, to be honest, sir, who\u2019d have thought that we\u2019d need to protect the king\u2019s saddle, of all things under the Halls?\u201D\r\nDalinar nodded to Adolin, and they stepped out of the tent. \u201CWell?\u201D\r\n\u201CThey probably didn\u2019t do much to help our cause,\u201D Adolin said with a grimace. \u201CDespite their ardor. Or, rather, because of it.\u201D\r\n\u201CAgreed, unfortunately.\u201D Dalinar let out a sigh. He waved to Tadet; the short ardent was standing to the side of the tent. \u201CInterview them separately,\u201D Dalinar told him softly. \u201CSee if you can tease specifics from them. Try to find out the exact words Sadeas used, and what their exact responses were.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes, Brightlord.\u201D\r\n\u201CCome, Adolin,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CWe\u2019ve still got a few inspections to do.\u201D\r\n\u201CFather,\u201D Adolin said, taking Dalinar\u2019s arm. Their armor clinked softly.\r\nDalinar turned to him, frowning, and Adolin made a quick gesture toward the Cobalt Guard. A request for space to speak. The guards moved efficiently and quickly, clearing a private space around the two men.\r\n\u201CWhat is this about, Father?\u201D Adolin demanded softly.\r\n\u201CWhat? We\u2019re doing inspections and seeing to camp business.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd in each case, you shove me out into the lead,\u201D Adolin said. \u201CAwkwardly, in a few cases, I might add. What\u2019s wrong? What\u2019s going on inside that head of yours?\u201D\r\n\u201CI thought you had a distinct problem with the things going on inside my head.\u201D\r\nAdolin winced. \u201CFather, I\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CNo, it\u2019s all right, Adolin. I\u2019m just trying to make a difficult decision. It helps me to move about while I do it.\u201D Dalinar grimaced. \u201CAnother man might find a place to sit and brood, but that never seems to help me. I\u2019ve got too much to do.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat is it you\u2019re trying to decide?\u201D Adolin asked. \u201CPerhaps I can help.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou already have. I\u2014\u201D Dalinar cut off, frowning. A small force of soldiers was walking up to the Fifth Battalion\u2019s practice yards. They were escorting a man in red and brown. Those were Thanadal\u2019s colors.\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t you have a meeting with him this evening?\u201D Adolin asked.\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D Dalinar said.\r\nNiter\u2014head of the Cobalt Guard\u2014ran to intercept the newcomers. He could be overly suspicious at times, but that wasn\u2019t a terrible trait for a bodyguard to have. He returned to Dalinar and Adolin shortly. Tanfaced, Niter bore a black beard, cut short. He was a lighteyes of very low rank, and had been with the guard for years. \u201CHe says that Highprince Thanadal will be unable to meet with you today as planned.\u201D\r\nDalinar\u2019s expression grew dark. \u201CI will speak to the runner myself.\u201D\r\nReluctantly, Niter waved the spindly fellow forward. He approached and dropped to one knee before Dalinar. \u201CBrightlord.\u201D\r\nThis time, Dalinar didn\u2019t ask for Adolin to take the lead. \u201CDeliver your message.\u201D\r\n\u201CBrightlord Thanadal regrets that he is unable to attend you this day.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd did he offer another time to meet?\u201D\r\n\u201CHe regrets to say that he has grown too busy. But he would be happy to speak with you at the king\u2019s feast one evening.\u201D\r\nIn public,Adolin thought,\r\nwhere half the men nearby will be eavesdropping while the other half\u2014likely including Thanadal himself\u2014will probably be drunk.\r\n\u201CI see,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CAnd did he give any indication of when he\u2019d no longer be so busy?\u201D\r\n\u201CBrightlord,\u201D the messenger said, growing uncomfortable. \u201CHe said that if you pressed, I should explain that he has spoken with several of the other highprinces, and feels he knows the nature of your inquiry. He said to tell you he does not wish to form an alliance, nor does he have any intention of going on a joint plateau assault with you.\u201D\r\nDalinar\u2019s expression grew darker. He dismissed the messenger with a wave, then turned to Adolin. The Cobalt Guard still kept a space open around them so they could talk.\r\n\u201CThanadal was the last of them,\u201D Dalinar said. Each highprince had turned him down in his own way. Hatham with exceeding politeness, Bethab by letting his wife give the explanation, Thanadal with hostile civility. \u201CAll of them but Sadeas, at least.\u201D\r\n\u201CI doubt it would be wise to approach him with this, Father.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou\u2019re probably right.\u201D Dalinar\u2019s voice was cold. He was angry. Furious, even. \u201CThey\u2019re sending me a message. They\u2019ve never liked the influence I have over the king, and they\u2019re eager to see me fall. They don\u2019t want to do something I ask them to, just in case it might help me regain my footing.\u201D\r\n\u201CFather, I\u2019m sorry.\u201D\r\n\u201CPerhaps it\u2019s for the best. The important point is that I have failed. I\r\ncan\u2019tget them to work together. Elhokar was right.\u201D He looked to Adolin. \u201CI would like you to continue inspections for me, son. There\u2019s something I want to do.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat?\u201D\r\n\u201CJust some work I see needs to be done.\u201D\r\nAdolin wanted to object, but he couldn\u2019t think of the words to say. Finally, he sighed and gave a nod. \u201CYou\u2019ll tell me what this is about, though?\u201D\r\n\u201CSoon,\u201D Dalinar promised. \u201CVery soon.\u201D\r\nDalinar watched his son leave, striding purposefully away. He would make a good highprince. Dalinar\u2019s decision was a simple one.\r\nWas it time to step aside, and let his son take his place?\r\nIf he took this step, Dalinar would be expected to stay out of politics, retiring to his lands and leaving Adolin to rule. It was a painful decision to contemplate, and he had to be careful not to make it hastily. But if he really was going mad, as everyone in the camp seemed to believe, then he\r\nhadto step down. And soon, before his condition progressed to the point that he no longer had the presence of mind to let go.\r\nA monarch is control,he thought, remembering a passage from\r\nThe Way of Kings.\r\nHe provides stability. It is his service and his trade good. If he cannot control himself, then how can he control the lives of men? What merchant worth his Stormlight won\u2019t partake of the very fruit he sells?\r\nOdd, that those quotes still came to him, even as he was wondering if they had\u2014in part\u2014driven him to madness. \u201CNiter,\u201D he said. \u201CFetch my warhammer. Have it waiting for me at the staging field.\u201D\r\nDalinar wanted to be moving, working, as he thought. His guards hastened to keep up as he strode down the pathway between the barracks of Battalions Six and Seven. Niter sent several men to fetch the weapon. His voice sounded strangely excited, as if he thought Dalinar was going to do something impressive.\r\nDalinar doubted he would think it so. He eventually strode out onto the staging field, cape fluttering behind him, plated boots clanking against the\u00A0stones. He didn\u2019t have to wait long for the hammer; it came pulled by\u00A0two men on a small cart. Sweating, the soldiers heaved it from the cart, the haft as thick as a man\u2019s wrist and the front of the head larger than an outspread palm. Two men together could barely lift it.\r\nDalinar grabbed the hammer with one gauntleted hand, swinging it up to rest on his shoulder. He ignored the soldiers performing exercises on the field, walking to where the group of dirty workers chipped at the latrine ditch. They looked up at him, horrified to see the highprince himself looming over them in full Shardplate.\r\n\u201CWho\u2019s in charge here?\u201D Dalinar asked.\r\nA scruffy civilian in brown trousers raised a nervous hand. \u201CBrightlord, how may we serve you?\u201D\r\n\u201CBy relaxing for a little while,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201COut with you.\u201D\r\nThe worried workers scrambled out. Lighteyed officers gathered behind, confused by Dalinar\u2019s actions.\r\nDalinar gripped the haft of his warhammer in a gauntleted hand; the metal shaft was wrapped tightly with leather. Taking a deep breath, he leaped down into the half-finished ditch, lifted the hammer, then swung, slamming the weapon down against the rock.\r\nA powerful\r\ncrackrang across the practice field, and a wave of shock ran up Dalinar\u2019s arms. The Shardplate absorbed most of the recoil, and he left a large crack in the stones. He hefted and swung again, this time breaking free a large section of rock. Though it would have been difficult for two or three regular men to lift, Dalinar grabbed it with one hand and tossed it aside. It clattered across the stones.\r\nWhere\r\nwerethe Shards for regular men? Why hadn\u2019t the ancients, who were so wise, created anything to help them? As Dalinar continued to work, beats of his hammer throwing chips and dust into the air, he easily did the work of twenty men. Shardplate could be used for so many things to ease the lives of workers and darkeyes across Roshar.\r\nIt felt good to be working. To be doing something useful. Lately, he felt as if his efforts had been akin to running about in circles. The work helped him think.\r\nHe\r\nwaslosing his thirst for battle. That worried him, as the Thrill\u2014the enjoyment and longing for war\u2014was part of what drove the Alethi as a people. The grandest of masculine arts was to become a great warrior, and the most important Calling was to fight. The Almighty himself depended on the Alethi to train themselves in honorable battle so that when they died, they could join the Heralds\u2019 army and win back the Tranquiline Halls.\r\nAnd yet, thinking about killing was starting to sicken him. It had grown worse since that last bridge assault. What would happen next time he went into battle? He could not lead this way. That was a major reason that abdicating in favor of Adolin looked right.\r\nHe continued to swing. Again and again, beating against the stones. Soldiers gathered above and\u2014despite his orders\u2014the workers did not leave to relax. They watched, dumbfounded, as a Shardbearer did their work. Occasionally, he summoned his Blade and used it to cut the rock, slicing out sections before returning to the hammer to break them apart.\r\nHe probably looked ridiculous. He couldn\u2019t do the work of all of the laborers in camp, and he had important tasks to fill his time. There was no reason for him to get down in a trench and toil. And yet it felt so\r\ngood. So wonderful to pitch in directly with the needs of the camp. The results of what he did to protect Elhokar were often difficult to gauge; it was fulfilling to be able to do something where his progress was obvious.\r\nBut even in this, he was acting according to the ideals that had infected him. The book spoke of a king carrying the burdens of his people. It said that those who led were the lowest of men, for they were required to serve everyone. It all swirled around in him. The Codes, the teachings of the book, the things the visions\u2014or delusions\u2014showed.\r\nNever fight other men except when forced to in war.\r\nBang!\r\nLet your actions defend you, not your words.\r\nBang!\r\nExpect honor from those you meet, and give them the chance to live up to it.\r\nBang!\r\nRule as you would be ruled.\r\nBang!\r\nHe stood waist-deep in what would eventually be a latrine, his ears filled with the groans of breaking stone. He was coming to believe those ideals. No, he\u2019d already come to believe them. Now he was living them. What would the world be like if all men lived as the book proclaimed?\r\nSomeone had to start. Someone had to be the model. In this, he had a reason\r\nnotto abdicate. Whether or not he was mad, the way he now did things was better than the way Sadeas or the others did them. One needed only look at the lives of his soldiers and his people to see that was true.\r\nBang!\r\nStone could not be changed without pounding. Was it the same with a man like him? Was that why everything was so hard for him suddenly? But why him? Dalinar wasn\u2019t a philosopher or idealist. He was a soldier. And\u2014if he admitted the truth\u2014in earlier years, he\u2019d been a tyrant and a warmonger. Could twilight years spent pretending to follow the precepts of better men erase a lifetime of butchery?\r\nHe had begun to sweat. The swath he had cut through the ground was as wide as a man was tall, as deep as his chest, and some thirty yards long. The longer he worked, the more people gathered to watch and whisper.\r\nShardplate was sacred. Was the highprince really digging a\r\nlatrinewith it? Had the stress affected him that profoundly? Frightened of highstorms. Growing cowardly. Refusing to duel or defend himself from slurs. Afraid of fighting, wishing to give up the war.\r\nSuspected of trying to kill the king.\r\nEventually, Teleb decided that letting all the people stare down at Dalinar wasn\u2019t respectful, and he ordered the men back to their separate duties. He cleared away the workers, taking Dalinar\u2019s order to heart and commanding them to sit in the shade and \u201Cconverse in a lighthearted manner.\u201D From someone else, that command might have been said with a smile, but Teleb was as literal as the rocks themselves.\r\nStill Dalinar worked. He knew where the latrine was supposed to end; he\u2019d approved the work order. A long, sloping trough was to be cut, then covered with oiled and tarred boards to seal in the scent. A latrine house would be set at the high end, and the contents could be Soulcast to smoke once every few months.\r\nThe work felt even better once he was alone. One man, breaking rocks, pounding beat after beat. Like the drums the Parshendi had played on that day so long past. Dalinar could feel those beats still, could hear them in his mind, shaking him.\r\nI\u2019m sorry, brother.\r\nHe had spoken to the ardents about his visions. They felt that the visions were most likely a product of an overtaxed mind.\r\nHe had no reason to believe the truth of anything the visions showed him. In following them, he had done more than just ignore Sadeas\u2019s maneuvers; he\u2019d depleted his resources precariously. His reputation was on the brink of ruin. He was in danger of dragging down the entire Kholin house.\r\nAnd that was the most important point in favor of him abdicating. If he continued, his actions could very well lead to the deaths of Adolin, Renarin, and Elhokar. He would risk his own life for his ideals, but could he risk the lives of his sons?\r\nChips sprayed, bouncing off his Plate. He was beginning to feel worn and tired. The Plate didn\u2019t do the work for him\u2014it enhanced his strength, so each strike of the hammer was his own. His fingers were growing numb from the repeated vibration of the hammer\u2019s haft. He was close to a decision. His mind was calm, clear.\r\nHe swung the hammer again.\r\n\u201CWouldn\u2019t the Blade be more efficient?\u201D asked a dry, feminine voice.\r\nDalinar froze, the hammer\u2019s head resting on broken stone. He turned to see Navani standing beside the trough, wearing a gown of blue and soft red, her grey-sprinkled hair reflecting light from a sun that was unexpectedly close to setting. She was attended by two young women\u2014not her own wards, but ones she had \u201Cborrowed\u201D from other lighteyed women in the camp.\r\nNavani stood with her arms folded, the sunlight behind her like a halo. Dalinar hesitantly raised an armored forearm to block the light. \u201CMathana?\u201D\r\n\u201CThe rockwork,\u201D Navani said, nodding to the trough. \u201CNow, I wouldn\u2019t\r\npresumeto make judgments; hitting things is a masculine art. But are you not in the possession of a sword that can cut through stone as easily as\u2014I once had it described to me\u2014a highstorm blows over a Herdazian?\u201D\r\nDalinar looked back at the rocks. Then he raised his hammer again and slammed it into the stones, making a satisfying crunch. \u201CShardblades are too good at cutting.\u201D\r\n\u201CCurious,\u201D she said. \u201CI\u2019ll do my best to pretend there was sense in that. As an aside, has it ever struck you that most masculine arts deal with destroying, while feminine arts deal with creation?\u201D\r\nDalinar swung again.\r\nBang!Remarkable how much easier it was to have a conversation with Navani while not looking directly at her. \u201CI do use the Blade to cut down the sides and middle. But I still have to break up the rocks. Have you ever tried to lift out a chunk of stone that has been sliced by a Shardblade?\u201D\r\n\u201CI can\u2019t say that I have.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s not easy.\u201D\r\nBang!\u201CBlades make a very thin cut. The rocks still press against one another. It\u2019s hard to grasp or move them.\u201D\r\nBang!\u201CIt\u2019s more complicated than it seems.\u201D\r\nBang!\u201CThis is the best way.\u201D\r\nNavani dusted a few chips of stone from her dress. \u201CAnd more messy, I see.\u201D\r\nBang!\r\n\u201CSo, are you going to apologize?\u201D she asked.\r\n\u201CFor?\u201D\r\n\u201CFor missing our appointment.\u201D\r\nDalinar froze in midswing. He\u2019d completely forgotten that, at the feast when she\u2019d first returned, he\u2019d agreed to have Navani read for him today. He hadn\u2019t told his scribes of the appointment. He turned toward her, chagrined. He\u2019d been angered because Thanadal had canceled their appointment, but at least\r\nhehad thought to send a messenger.\r\nNavani stood with arms folded, safehand tucked away, sleek dress seeming to burn with sunlight. She bore a hint of a smile on her lips. By standing her up, he\u2019d put himself\u2014by honor\u2014in her power.\r\n\u201CI\u2019m truly sorry,\u201D he said. \u201CI\u2019ve had some difficult things to consider lately, but that doesn\u2019t excuse forgetting you.\u201D\r\n\u201CI know. I\u2019ll ponder a way to let you make up for the lapse. But for now, you should know that one of your spanreeds is flashing.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat? Which one?\u201D\r\n\u201CYour scribes say it is the one bound to my daughter.\u201D\r\nJasnah!It had been weeks since they\u2019d last communicated; the messages he\u2019d sent her had prompted only the tersest of answers. When Jasnah was deeply immersed in one of her projects, she often ignored all else. If she was sending to him now, either she\u2019d discovered something or she was taking a break to renew her contacts.\r\nDalinar turned to look down the latrine. He\u2019d nearly completed it; and he realized he\u2019d been unconsciously planning to make his final decision once he reached the end. He itched to continue working.\r\nBut if Jasnah wanted to converse\u2026\r\nHe needed to talk with her. Perhaps he could persuade her to return to the Shattered Plains. He would feel a lot more secure about abdicating if he knew that she would come watch over Elhokar and Adolin.\r\nDalinar tossed aside his hammer\u2014his pounding had bent the haft a good thirty degrees and the head was a misshapen lump\u2014and jumped out of the ditch. He\u2019d have a new weapon forged; that was not unusual for Shardbearers.\r\n\u201CYour pardon, Mathana,\u201D Dalinar said, \u201Cbut I fear I must beg your leave so soon after begging your forgiveness. I must receive this communication.\u201D\r\nHe bowed to her and turned to hurry away.\r\n\u201CActually,\u201D Navani said from behind, \u201CI think\r\nI\u2019llbeg something of you. It has been months since I\u2019ve spoken with my daughter. I\u2019ll join you, if you\u2019ll permit it.\u201D\r\nHe hesitated, but he couldn\u2019t deny her so soon after giving her offense. \u201COf course.\u201D He waited as Navani walked to her palanquin and settled herself. The bearers lifted it, and Dalinar struck out again, the bearers and Navani\u2019s borrowed wards walking close.\r\n\u201CYou are a kind man, Dalinar Kholin,\u201D Navani said, that same sly smile on her lips as she sat back in the cushioned chair. \u201CI\u2019m afraid that I\u2019m compelled to find you fascinating.\u201D\r\n\u201CMy sense of honor makes me easy to manipulate,\u201D Dalinar said, eyes forward. Dealing with her was\r\nnotsomething he needed right now. \u201CI know it does. No need to toy with me, Navani.\u201D\r\nShe laughed softly. \u201CI\u2019m not trying to take advantage of you, Dalinar, I\u2014\u201D She paused. \u201CWell, perhaps I am taking advantage of you just a little. But I\u2019m not \u2018toying\u2019 with you. This last year in particular, you\u2019ve begun to\r\nbethe person the others all\r\nclaimthat they are. Can\u2019t you see how intriguing that makes you?\u201D\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t do it to be intriguing.\u201D\r\n\u201CIf you did, it wouldn\u2019t work!\u201D She leaned toward him. \u201CDo you know why I picked Gavilar instead of you all those years ago?\u201D\r\nBlast.Her comments\u2014her presence\u2014were like a goblet of darkwine poured into the middle of his crystal thoughts. The clarity he\u2019d sought in hard labor was quickly vanishing. Did she have to be so forward? He didn\u2019t answer the question. Instead, he picked up his pace and hoped that she\u2019d see he didn\u2019t want to discuss the topic.\r\nIt was no use. \u201CI didn\u2019t pick him because he would become king, Dalinar. Though that\u2019s what everyone says. I chose him because you\r\nfrightenedme. That intensity of yours\u2026it scared your brother too, you know.\u201D\r\nHe said nothing.\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s still in there,\u201D she said. \u201CI can see it in your eyes. But you\u2019ve wrapped armor around it, a glistening set of Shardplate to contain it. That is part of what I find fascinating.\u201D\r\nHe stopped, looking at her. The palanquin bearers halted. \u201CThis would not work, Navani,\u201D he said softly.\r\n\u201CWouldn\u2019t it?\u201D\r\nHe shook his head. \u201CI will not dishonor my brother\u2019s memory.\u201D He regarded her sternly, and she eventually nodded.\r\nWhen he continued walking, she said nothing, though she did eye him slyly from time to time. Eventually, they reached his personal complex, marked by fluttering blue banners with the glyphpair\r\nkhokhand\r\nlinil, the\u00A0former drawn in the shape of a crown, the second forming a tower. Dalinar\u2019s mother had drawn the original design, the same his signet ring bore, though Elhokar used a sword and crown instead.\r\nThe soldiers at the entrance to his complex saluted, and Dalinar waited for Navani to join him before entering. The cavernous interior was lit by infused sapphires. Once they reached his sitting chamber, he was again struck by just how lavish it had gotten over the months.\r\nThree of his clerks waited with their attending girls. All six stood up when he entered. Adolin was also there.\r\nDalinar frowned at the youth. \u201CShouldn\u2019t you be seeing to the inspections?\u201D\r\nAdolin started. \u201CFather, I finished those hours ago.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou did?\u201D\r\nStormfather! How long did I spend pounding on those stones?\r\n\u201CFather,\u201D Adolin said, stepping up to him. \u201CCan we speak privately for a moment?\u201D As usual, Adolin\u2019s black-peppered blond hair was an unruly mop. He\u2019d changed from his Plate and bathed, and now he wore a fashionable\u2014though battle-worthy\u2014uniform with a long blue coat, buttoned at the sides, and straight, stiff brown trousers beneath.\r\n\u201CI\u2019m not ready to discuss that as yet, son,\u201D Dalinar said softly. \u201CI need a little more time.\u201D\r\nAdolin studied him, eyes concerned.\r\nHe will make a fine highprince,Dalinar thought.\r\nHe\u2019s been reared to it in a way that I never was.\r\n\u201CAll right then,\u201D Adolin said. \u201CBut there\u2019s something else I want to ask you.\u201D He pointed toward one of the clerks, a woman with auburn hair and only a few strands of black. She was lithe and long-necked, wearing a green dress, her hair arranged high on her head in a complex set of braids held together with four traditional steel hair-spikes.\r\n\u201CThis is Danlan Morakotha,\u201D Adolin said softly to Dalinar. \u201CShe came into camp yesterday to spend a few months with her father, Brightlord Morakotha. She has been calling on me recently, and I took the liberty of offering her a position among your clerks while she is here.\u201D\r\nDalinar blinked. \u201CWhat about\u2026\u201D\r\n\u201CMalasha?\u201D Adolin sighed. \u201CDidn\u2019t work out.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd this one?\u201D Dalinar asked, voice hushed, yet incredulous. \u201CHow long did you say she\u2019s been in camp? Since yesterday? And you\u2019ve already got her\r\ncallingon you?\u201D\r\nAdolin shrugged. \u201CWell, I do have a reputation to maintain.\u201D\r\nDalinar sighed, eyeing Navani, who stood close enough to hear. She pretended\u2014for propriety\u2014that she wasn\u2019t listening in. \u201CYou know, it is customary to eventually choose just one woman to court.\u201D\r\nYou\u2019re going to need a good wife, son. Perhaps very soon.\r\n\u201CWhen I\u2019m old and boring, perhaps,\u201D Adolin said, smiling at the young woman. She\r\nwaspretty. But only in camp one day?\r\nBlood of my ancestors,Dalinar thought. He\u2019d spent three years courting the woman who\u2019d eventually become his wife. Even if he couldn\u2019t remember her face, he\r\ndidremember how persistently he\u2019d pursued her.\r\nSurely he\u2019d loved her. All emotion regarding her was gone, wiped from his mind by forces he should never have tempted. Unfortunately, he\r\ndidremember how much he\u2019d desired Navani, years before meeting the woman who would become his wife.\r\nStop that,he told himself. Moments ago, he\u2019d been on the brink of deciding to abdicate his seat as highprince. It was no time to let Navani distract him.\r\n\u201CBrightness Danlan Morakotha,\u201D he said to the young woman. \u201CYou are welcome among my clerks. I understand that I\u2019ve received a communication?\u201D\r\n\u201CIndeed, Brightlord,\u201D the woman said, curtsying. She nodded to the line of five spanreeds sitting on his bookshelf, set upright in pen holders. The spanreeds looked like ordinary writing reeds, except that each had a small infused ruby affixed. The one on the far right pulsed slowly.\r\nLitima was there, and though she had seniority, she nodded for Danlan to fetch the spanreed. The young woman hurried to the bookshelf and moved the still-blinking reed to the small writing desk beside the lectern. She carefully clipped a piece of paper onto the writing board and put the ink vial into its hole, twisting it snugly into place and then pulling the stopper. Lighteyed women were very proficient at working with just their freehand.\r\nShe sat down, looking up at him, seeming slightly nervous. Dalinar didn\u2019t trust her, of course\u2014she could easily be a spy for one of the other highprinces. Unfortunately, there weren\u2019t\r\nanywomen in camp he trusted completely, not with Jasnah gone.\r\n\u201CI am ready, Brightlord,\u201D Danlan said. She had a breathy, husky voice. Just the type that attracted Adolin. He hoped she wasn\u2019t as vapid as those he usually picked.\r\n\u201CProceed,\u201D Dalinar said, waving Navani toward one of the room\u2019s plush easy chairs. The other clerks sat back down on their bench.\r\nDanlan turned the spanreed\u2019s gemstone one notch, indicating that the request had been acknowledged. Then she checked the levels on the sides of the writing board\u2014small vials of oil with bubbles at the center, which allowed her to make the board perfectly flat. Finally, she inked the reed and placed it on the dot at the top left of the page. Holding it upright, she twisted the gemstone setting one more time with her thumb. Then she removed her hand.\r\nThe reed remained in place, tip against the paper, hovering as if held in a phantom hand. Then it began to write, mimicking the exact movements Jasnah made miles away, writing with a reed conjoined to this one.\r\nDalinar stood beside the writing table, armored arms folded. He could see that his proximity made Danlan nervous, but he was too anxious to sit.\r\nJasnah had elegant handwriting, of course\u2014Jasnah rarely did anything without taking the time to perfect it. Dalinar leaned forward as the familiar\u2014yet indecipherable\u2014lines appeared on the page in stark violet. Faint wisps of reddish smoke floated up from the gemstone.\r\nThe pen stopped writing, freezing in place.\r\n\u201C\u2018Uncle,\u2019\u201D Danlan read, \u201C\u2018I presume that you are well.\u2019\u201D\r\n\u201CIndeed,\u201D Dalinar replied. \u201CI am well cared for by those around me.\u201D The words were code indicating that he didn\u2019t trust\u2014or at least didn\u2019t know\u2014everyone listening. Jasnah would be careful not to send anything too sensitive.\r\nDanlan took the pen and twisted the gemstone, then wrote out the words, sending them across the ocean to Jasnah. Was she still in Tukar? After Danlan finished writing, she returned it to the dot at the top left\u2014the spot where the pens were both to be placed so Jasnah could continue the conversation\u2014then turned the gemstone back to the previous setting.\r\n\u201C\u2018As I expected, I have found my way to Kharbranth,\u2019\u201D Danlan read. \u201C\u2018The secrets I seek are too obscure to be contained even in the Palanaeum, but I find hints. Tantalizing fragments. Is Elhokar well?\u2019\u201D\r\nHints? Fragments? Of what?She had a penchant for drama, Jasnah did, though she wasn\u2019t as flamboyant about it as the king.\r\n\u201CYour brother tried very hard to get himself killed by a chasmfiend a few weeks back,\u201D Dalinar replied. Adolin smiled at that, leaning with his shoulder against the bookcase. \u201CBut evidently the Heralds watch over him. He is well, though your presence here is sorely missed. I\u2019m certain he could use your counsel. He is relying heavily on Brightness Lalai to act as clerk.\u201D\r\nPerhaps that would make Jasnah return. There was little love lost between herself and Sadeas\u2019s cousin, who was the king\u2019s head scribe in the queen\u2019s absence.\r\nDanlan scratched away, writing the words. To the side, Navani cleared her throat.\r\n\u201COh,\u201D Dalinar said, \u201Cadd this: Your mother is here in the warcamps again.\u201D\r\nA short time later, the pen wrote of its own volition. \u201C\u2018Send my mother my respect. Keep her at arm\u2019s length, Uncle. She bites.\u2019\u201D\r\nFrom the side, Navani sniffed, and Dalinar realized he hadn\u2019t signaled that Navani was actually listening. He blushed as Danlan continued speaking. \u201C\u2018I cannot speak of my work via spanreed, but I\u2019m growing increasingly concerned. There\r\nissomething here, hidden by the sheer number of accrued pages in the historical record.\u2019\u201D\r\nJasnah was a Veristitalian. She\u2019d explained it to him once; they were an order of scholars who tried to find the truth in the past. They wished to create unbiased, factual accounts of what had happened in order to extrapolate what to do in the future. He wasn\u2019t clear on why they thought themselves different from regular historians.\r\n\u201CWill you be returning?\u201D Dalinar asked.\r\n\u201C\u2018I cannot say,\u2019\u201D Danlan read after the reply came. \u201C\u2018I do not dare stop my research. But a time may soon come when I dare not stay away either.\u2019\u201D\r\nWhat?Dalinar thought.\r\n\u201C\u2018Regardless,\u2019\u201D Danlan continued, \u201C\u2018I have some questions for you. I need you to describe for me again what happened when you met that first Parshendi patrol seven years ago.\u2019\u201D\r\nDalinar frowned. Despite the Plate\u2019s augmentation, his digging had left him feeling tired. But he didn\u2019t dare sit on one of the room\u2019s chairs while wearing his Plate. He took off one of his gauntlets, though, and ran his hand through his hair. He wasn\u2019t fond of this topic, but part of him was glad of the distraction. A reason to hold off on making a decision that would change his life forever.\r\nDanlan looked at him, prepared to dictate his words. Why did Jasnah want this story again? Hadn\u2019t she written an account of these very events in her biography of her father?\r\nWell, she would eventually tell him why, and\u2014if her past revelations were any indication\u2014her current project would be of great worth. He wished Elhokar had received a measure of his sister\u2019s wisdom.\r\n\u201CThese are painful memories, Jasnah. I wish I\u2019d never convinced your father to go on that expedition. If we\u2019d never discovered the Parshendi, then they couldn\u2019t have assassinated him. The first meeting happened when we were exploring a forest that wasn\u2019t on the maps. This was south of the Shattered Plains, in a valley about two weeks\u2019 march from the Drying Sea.\u201D\r\nDuring Gavilar\u2019s youth, only two things had thrilled him\u2014conquest and hunting. When he hadn\u2019t been seeking one, it had been the other. Suggesting the hunt had seemed rational at the time. Gavilar had been acting oddly, losing his thirst for battle. Men had started to say that he was weak. Dalinar had wanted to remind his brother of the good times in their youth. Hence the hunt for a legendary chasmfiend.\r\n\u201CYour father wasn\u2019t with me when I ran across them,\u201D Dalinar continued, thinking back. Camping on humid, forested hills. Interrogating Natan natives via translators. Looking for scat or broken trees. \u201CI was leading scouts up a tributary of the Deathbend River while your father scouted downstream. We found the Parshendi camped on the other side. I didn\u2019t believe it at first. Parshmen.\r\nCamped, free and organized. And they carried weapons. Not crude ones, either. Swords, spears with carved hafts\u2026\u201D\r\nHe trailed off. Gavilar hadn\u2019t believed either, when Dalinar told him. There was no such thing as a free parshman tribe. They were servants, and always had been servants.\r\n\u201C\u2018Did they have Shardblades then?\u2019\u201D Danlan said. Dalinar hadn\u2019t realized that Jasnah had made a response.\r\n\u201CNo.\u201D\r\nA scratched reply eventually came. \u201C\u2018But they have them now. When did you first see a Parshendi Shardbearer?\u2019\u201D\r\n\u201CAfter Gavilar\u2019s death,\u201D Dalinar said.\r\nHe made the connection. They\u2019d always wondered why Gavilar had wanted a treaty with the Parshendi. They wouldn\u2019t have needed one just to harvest the greatshells on the Shattered Plains; the Parshendi hadn\u2019t lived on the Plains then.\r\nDalinar felt a chill. Could his brother have\r\nknownthat these Parshendi had access to Shardblades? Had he made the treaty hoping to get out of them where they\u2019d found the weapons?\r\nIs it his death?Dalinar wondered.\r\nIs that the secret Jasnah\u2019s looking for?She\u2019d never shown Elhokar\u2019s dedication to vengeance, but she thought differently from her brother. Revenge wouldn\u2019t drive her. But\r\nquestions. Yes, questions would.\r\n\u201C\u2018One more thing, Uncle,\u2019\u201D Danlan read. \u201C\u2018Then I can go back to digging through this labyrinth of a library. At times, I feel like a cairn robber, sifting through the bones of those long dead. Regardless. The Parshendi, you once mentioned how quickly they seemed to learn our language.\u2019\u201D\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CIn a matter of days, we were speaking and communicating quite well. Remarkable.\u201D Who would have thought that parshmen, of all people, had the wit for such a marvel? Most he\u2019d known didn\u2019t do much speaking at all.\r\n\u201C\u2018What were the first things they spoke to you about?\u2019\u201D Danlan said. \u201C\u2018The very\r\nfirstquestions they asked? Can you remember?\u2019\u201D\r\nDalinar closed his eyes, remembering days with the Parshendi camped just across the river from them. Gavilar had become fascinated by them. \u201CThey wanted to see our maps.\u201D\r\n\u201CDid they mention the Voidbringers?\u201D\r\nVoidbringers? \u201CNot that I recall. Why?\u201D\r\n\u201C\u2018I\u2019d rather not say right now. However, I want to show you something. Have your scribe get out a new sheet of paper.\u2019\u201D\r\nDanlan affixed a new page to the writing board. She put the pen to the corner and let go. It rose and began to scratch back and forth in quick, bold strokes. It was a drawing. Dalinar stood up and stepped closer, and Adolin crowded near. Reed and ink wasn\u2019t the best medium, and drawing across spans wasn\u2019t precise. The pen leaked tiny globs of ink in places it wouldn\u2019t have on the other side, and though the inkwell was in the exact same place\u2014allowing Jasnah to re-ink both her reed and Dalinar\u2019s at the same time\u2014his reed sometimes ran out before the one on the other side.\r\nStill, the picture was marvelous.\r\nThis isn\u2019t Jasnah, Dalinar realized. Whoever was doing the drawing was far, far more talented than his niece.\r\nThe picture resolved into a depiction of a tall shadow looming over some buildings. Hints of carapace and claws showed in the thin ink lines, and shadows were made by drawing finer lines close together.\r\nDanlan set it aside, getting out a third sheet of paper. Dalinar held the drawing up, Adolin at his side. The nightmarish beast in the lines and shadows was faintly familiar. Like\u2026\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s a chasmfiend,\u201D Adolin said, pointing. \u201CIt\u2019s distorted\u2014far more menacing in the face and larger at the shoulders, and I don\u2019t see its second set of foreclaws\u2014but someone was obviously trying to draw one of them.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D Dalinar said, rubbing his chin.\r\n\u201C\u2018This is a depiction from one of the books here,\u2019\u201D Danlan read. \u201C\u2018My new ward is quite skilled at drawing, and so I had her reproduce it for you. Tell me. Does it remind you of anything?\u2019\u201D\r\nA new ward?Dalinar thought. It had been years since Jasnah had taken one. She always said she didn\u2019t have the time. \u201CThis picture\u2019s of a chasmfiend,\u201D Dalinar said.\r\nDanlan wrote the words. A moment later, the reply came. \u201C\u2018The book describes this as a picture of a Voidbringer.\u2019\u201D Danlan frowned, cocking her head. \u201C\u2018The book is a copy of a text originally written in the years before the Recreance. However, the illustrations are copied from another text, even older. In fact, some think that picture was drawn only two or three generations after the Heralds departed.\u2019\u201D\r\nAdolin whistled softly. That would make it very old indeed. So far as Dalinar understood, they had few pieces of art or writing dating from the shadowdays,\r\nThe Way of Kingsbeing one of the oldest, and the only complete text. And even it had survived only in translation; they had no copies in the original tongue.\r\n\u201C\u2018Before you jump to conclusions,\u2019\u201D Danlan read, \u201C\u2018I\u2019m not implying that the Voidbringers were the same thing as chasmfiends. I believe that the ancient artist didn\u2019t\r\nknowwhat a Voidbringer looked like, and so she drew the most horrific thing she knew of.\u2019\u201D\r\nBut how did the original artist know what a chasmfiend looked like?Dalinar thought.\r\nWe only just discovered the Shattered Plains\u2014\r\nBut of course. Though the Unclaimed Hills were now empty, they had once been an inhabited kingdom. Someone in the past had known about chasmfiends, known them well enough to draw one and label it a Voidbringer.\r\n\u201C\u2018I must go now,\u2019\u201D Jasnah said via Danlan. \u201C\u2018Care for my brother in my absence, Uncle.\u2019\u201D\r\n\u201CJasnah,\u201D Dalinar sent, choosing his words very carefully. \u201CThings are difficult here. The storm begins to blow unchecked, and the building shakes and moans. You may soon hear news that shocks you. It would be very nice if you could return and lend your aid.\u201D\r\nHe waited quietly for the reply, the spanreed scratching. \u201C\u2018I should like to promise a date when I will come.\u2019\u201D Dalinar could almost hear Jasnah\u2019s calm, cool voice. \u201C\u2018But I cannot estimate when my research will be completed.\u2019\u201D\r\n\u201CThis is very important, Jasnah,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CPlease reconsider.\u201D\r\n\u201C\u2018Be assured, Uncle, that I\r\namcoming. Eventually. I just can\u2019t say when.\u2019\u201D\r\nDalinar sighed.\r\n\u201C\u2018Note,\u2019\u201D Jasnah wrote, \u201C\u2018that I am most eager to see a chasmfiend for myself.\u2019\u201D\r\n\u201CA dead one,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CI have no intention of letting you repeat your brother\u2019s experience of a few weeks ago.\u201D\r\n\u201C\u2018Ah,\u2019\u201D Jasnah sent back, \u201C\u2018dear, overprotective Dalinar. One of these years, you will\r\nhaveto admit that your favored niece and nephew have grown up.\u2019\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll treat you as adults so long as you act the part,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CCome speedily, and we\u2019ll get you a\r\ndeadchasmfiend. Take care.\u201D\r\nThey waited to see if a further response came, but the gem stopped blinking, Jasnah\u2019s transmission complete. Danlan put away the spanreed and the board, and Dalinar thanked the clerks for their aid. They withdrew; Adolin looked as if he wanted to linger, but Dalinar gestured for him to leave.\r\nDalinar looked down at the picture of the chasmfiend again, unsatisfied. What had he gained from the conversation? More vague hints? What could be so important about Jasnah\u2019s research that she would ignore threats to the kingdom?\r\nHe would have to compose a more forthright letter to her once he\u2019d made his announcement, explaining why he had decided to step down. Perhaps that would bring her back.\r\nAnd, in a moment of shock, Dalinar realized that he had made his decision. Sometime between leaving the trench and now, he\u2019d stopped treating his abdication as an\r\nifand started thinking of it as a\r\nwhen. It was the right decision. He felt sick about it, but certain. A man sometimes needed to do things that were unpleasant.\r\nIt was the discussion with Jasnah,he realized.\r\nThe talk of her father.He\r\nwasacting like Gavilar at the end. That had nearly undermined the kingdom. Well, he needed to stop himself before he got that far. Perhaps whatever was happening to him was some kind of disease of the mind, inherited from their parents. It\u2014\r\n\u201CYou are quite fond of Jasnah,\u201D Navani said.\r\nDalinar started, turning away from the picture of the chasmfiend. He\u2019d assumed she\u2019d followed Adolin out. But she still stood there, looking at him.\r\n\u201CWhy is it,\u201D Navani said, \u201Cthat you encourage her so strongly to return?\u201D\r\nHe turned to face Navani, and realized that she\u2019d sent her two youthful attendants out with the clerks. They were now alone.\r\n\u201CNavani,\u201D he said. \u201CThis is inappropriate.\u201D\r\n\u201CBah. We\u2019re family, and I have questions.\u201D\r\nDalinar hesitated, then walked to the center of the room. Navani stood near the door. Blessedly, her attendants had left open the door at the end of the antechamber, and beyond it were two guards in the hall outside. It wasn\u2019t an ideal situation, but so long as Dalinar could see the guards and they him, his conversation with Navani was just barely, proper.\r\n\u201CDalinar?\u201D Navani asked. \u201CAre you going to answer me? Why is it you trust my daughter so much when others almost universally revile her?\u201D\r\n\u201CI consider their disdain for her to be a recommendation,\u201D he said.\r\n\u201CShe is a heretic.\u201D\r\n\u201CShe refused to join any of the devotaries because she did not believe in their teachings. Rather than compromise for the sake of appearances, she has been honest and has refused to make professions she does not believe. I find that a sign of honor.\u201D\r\nNavani snorted. \u201CYou two are a pair of nails in the same doorframe. Stern, hard, and storming annoying to pull free.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou should go now,\u201D Dalinar said, nodding toward the hallway. He suddenly felt very exhausted. \u201CPeople will talk.\u201D\r\n\u201CLet them. We need to plan, Dalinar. You are the most important highprince in\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CNavani,\u201D he cut in. \u201CI\u2019m going to abdicate in favor of Adolin.\u201D\r\nShe blinked in surprise.\r\n\u201CI\u2019m stepping down as soon as I can make the necessary arrangements. It will be a few days at most.\u201D Speaking the words felt odd, as if saying them made his decision real.\r\nNavani looked pained. \u201COh, Dalinar,\u201D she whispered. \u201CThis is a terrible mistake.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt is mine to make. And I must repeat my request. I have many things to think about, Navani, and I can\u2019t deal with you right now.\u201D He pointed at the doorway.\r\nNavani rolled her eyes, but left as requested. She shut the door behind her.\r\nThat\u2019s it,Dalinar thought, letting out a long exhalation.\r\nI\u2019ve made the decision.\r\nToo weary to remove his Plate unassisted, he sank down onto the floor, resting his head back against the wall. He would tell Adolin of his decision in the morning, then announce it at a feast within the week. From there, he would return to Alethkar and his lands.\r\nIt was over.\r\nTHE END OF\r\nPart Two"

      "ChapterName": "1-4: RYSN",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\nRysn hesitantly stepped down from the caravan\u2019s lead wagon. Her feet fell on soft, uneven ground that sank down a little beneath her.\r\nThat made her shiver, particularly since the too-thick grass didn\u2019t move away as it should. Rysn tapped her foot a few times. The grass didn\u2019t so much as quiver.\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s not going to move,\u201D Vstim said. \u201CGrass here doesn\u2019t behave the way it does elsewhere. Surely you\u2019ve heard that.\u201D The older man sat beneath the bright yellow canopy of the lead wagon. He rested one arm on the side rail, holding a set of ledgers with the other hand. One of his long white eyebrows was tucked behind his ear and he let the other trail down beside his face. He preferred stiffly starched robes\u2014blue and red\u2014and a flat-topped conical hat. It was classic Thaylen merchant\u2019s clothing: several decades out of date, yet still distinguished.\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve heard of the grass,\u201D Rysn said to him. \u201CBut it\u2019s just so\r\nodd.\u201D She stepped again, walking in a circle around the lead wagon. Yes, she\u2019d heard of the grass here in Shinovar, but she\u2019d assumed that it would just be lethargic. That people said it didn\u2019t disappear because it moved too slowly.\r\nBut no, that wasn\u2019t it. It didn\u2019t move\r\nat all. How did it survive? Shouldn\u2019t it have all been eaten away by animals? She shook her head in wonder, looking up across the plain. The grass completely\r\ncoveredit. The blades were all crowded together, and you couldn\u2019t see the ground. What a mess it was.\r\n\u201CThe ground is springy,\u201D she said, rounding back to her original side of the wagon. \u201CNot just because of the grass.\u201D\r\n\u201CHmm,\u201D Vstim said, still working on his ledgers. \u201CYes. It\u2019s called soil.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt makes me feel like I\u2019m going to sink down to my knees. How can the Shin stand living here?\u201D\r\n\u201CThey\u2019re an interesting people. Shouldn\u2019t you be setting up the device?\u201D\r\nRysn sighed, but walked to the rear of the wagon. The other wagons in the caravan\u2014six in all\u2014were pulling up and forming a loose circle. She took down the tailgate of the lead wagon and heaved, pulling out a wooden tripod nearly as tall as she was. She carried it over one shoulder, marching to the center of the grassy circle.\r\nShe was more fashionable than her babsk; she wore the most modern of clothing for a young woman her age: a deep blue patterned silk vest over a light green long-sleeved shirt with stiff cuffs. Her ankle-length skirt\u2014also green\u2014was stiff and businesslike, utilitarian in cut but embroidered for fashion.\r\nShe wore a green glove on her left hand. Covering the safehand was a silly tradition, just a result of Vorin cultural dominance. But it was best to keep up appearances. Many of the more traditional Thaylen people\u2014including, unfortunately, her babsk\u2014still found it scandalous for a woman to go about with her safehand uncovered.\r\nShe set up the tripod. It had been five months since Vstim become her babsk and she his apprentice. He\u2019d been good to her. Not all babsk were; by tradition, he was more than just her master. He was her father, legally, until he pronounced her ready to become a merchant on her own.\r\nShe did wish he wouldn\u2019t spend so much time traveling to such\r\noddplaces. He was known as a great merchant, and she\u2019d assumed that great merchants would be the ones visiting exotic cities and ports. Not ones who traveled to empty meadows in backward countries.\r\nTripod set up, she returned to the wagon to fetch the fabrial. The wagon back formed an enclosure with thick sides and top to offer protection against highstorms\u2014even the weaker ones in the West could be dangerous, at least until one got through the passes and into Shinovar.\r\nShe hurried back to the tripod with the fabrial\u2019s box. She slid off the wooden top and removed the large heliodor inside. The pale yellow gemstone, at least two inches in diameter, was fixed inside a metal framework. It glowed gently, not as bright as one might expect of such a sizable gem.\r\nShe set it in the tripod, then spun a few of the dials underneath, setting the fabrial to the people in the caravan. Then she pulled a stool from the wagon and sat down to watch. She\u2019d been astonished at what Vstim had paid for the device\u2014one of the new, recently invented types that would give warning if people approached. Was it really so important?\r\nShe sat back, looking up at the gemstone, watching to see if it grew brighter. The odd grass of the Shin lands waved in the wind, stubbornly refusing to withdraw, even at the strongest of gusts. In the distance rose the white peaks of the Misted Mountains, sheltering Shinovar. Those mountains caused the highstorms to break and fade, making Shinovar one of the only places in all of Roshar where highstorms did not reign.\r\nThe plain around her was dotted with strange, straight-trunked trees with stiff, skeletal branches full of leaves that didn\u2019t withdraw in the wind. The entire landscape had an eerie feel to it, as if it were dead. Nothing moved. With a start, Rysn realized she couldn\u2019t see any spren. Not a one. No windspren, no lifespren, nothing.\r\nIt was as if the entire land were slow of wit. Like a man who was born without all his brains, one who didn\u2019t know when to protect himself, but instead just stared at the wall drooling. She dug into the ground with a finger, then brought it up to inspect the \u201Csoil,\u201D as Vstim had called it. It was dirty stuff. Why, a strong gust could uproot this entire field of grass and blow it away. Good thing the highstorms couldn\u2019t reach these lands.\r\nNear the wagons, the servants and guards unloaded crates and set up camp. Suddenly, the heliodor began to pulse with a brighter yellow light. \u201CMaster!\u201D she called, standing. \u201CSomeone\u2019s nearby.\u201D\r\nVstim\u2014who had been going through crates\u2014looked up sharply. He waved to Kylrm, head of the guards, and his six men got out their bows.\r\n\u201CThere,\u201D one said, pointing.\r\nIn the distance, a group of horsemen was approaching. They didn\u2019t ride very quickly, and they led several large animals\u2014like thick, squat horses\u2014pulling wagons. The gemstone in the fabrial pulsed more brightly as the newcomers got closer.\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D Vstim said, looking at the fabrial. \u201CThat is going to be\r\nveryhandy. Good range on it.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut we knew they were coming,\u201D Rysn said, rising from her stool and walking over to him.\r\n\u201CThis time,\u201D he said. \u201CBut if it warns us of bandits in the dark, it\u2019ll repay its cost a dozen times over. Kylrm, lower your bows. You know how they feel about those things.\u201D\r\nThe guards did as they were told, and the group of Thaylens waited. Rysn found herself tucking her eyebrows back nervously, though she didn\u2019t know why she bothered. The newcomers were just Shin. Of course, Vstim insisted that she shouldn\u2019t think of them as savages. He seemed to have great respect for them.\r\nAs they approached, she was surprised by the variety in their appearance. Other Shin she\u2019d seen had worn basic brown robes or other worker\u2019s clothing. At the front of this group, however, was a man in what must be Shin finery: a bright, multicolored cloak that completely enveloped him, tied closed at the front. It trailed down on either side of his horse, drooping almost to the ground. Only his head was exposed.\r\nFour men rode on horses around him, and they wore more subdued clothing. Still bright, just not\r\nasbright. They wore shirts, trousers, and colorful capes.\r\nAt least three dozen other men walked alongside them, wearing brown tunics. More drove the three large wagons.\r\n\u201CWow,\u201D Rysn said. \u201CHe brought a lot of servants.\u201D\r\n\u201CServants?\u201D Vstim said.\r\n\u201CThe fellows in brown.\u201D\r\nHer babsk smiled. \u201CThose are his guards, child.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat? They look so dull.\u201D\r\n\u201CShin are a curious folk,\u201D he said. \u201CHere, warriors are the lowliest of men\u2014kind of like slaves. Men trade and sell them between houses by way of little stones that signify ownership, and any man who picks up a weapon must join them and be treated the same. The fellow in the fancy robe?\r\nHe\u2019sa farmer.\u201D\r\n\u201CA landowner, you mean?\u201D\r\n\u201CNo. As far as I can tell, he goes out every day\u2014well, the days when he\u2019s not overseeing a negotiation like this\u2014and works the fields. They treat all farmers like that, lavish them with attention and respect.\u201D\r\nRysn gaped. \u201CBut most villages are\r\nfilledwith farmers!\u201D\r\n\u201CIndeed,\u201D Vstim said. \u201CHoly places, here. Foreigners aren\u2019t allowed near fields or farming villages.\u201D\r\nHow strange,she thought.\r\nPerhaps living in this place has affected their minds.\r\nKylrm and his guards didn\u2019t look terribly pleased at being so heavily outnumbered, but Vstim didn\u2019t seem bothered. Once the Shin grew close, he walked out from his wagons without a hint of trepidation. Rysn hurried after him, her skirt brushing the grass below.\r\nBother,she thought. Another problem with its not retracting. If she had to buy a new hem because of this dull grass, it was going to make her very cross.\r\nVstim met up with the Shin, then bowed in a distinctive way, hands toward the ground. \u201C\r\nTan balo ken tala,\u201D he said. She didn\u2019t know what it meant.\r\nThe man in the cloak\u2014the\r\nfarmer\u2014nodded respectfully, and one of the other riders dismounted and walked forward. \u201CWinds of Fortune guide you, my friend.\u201D He spoke Thaylen very well. \u201CHe who adds is happy for your safe arrival.\u201D\r\n\u201CThank you, Thresh-son-Esan,\u201D Vstim said. \u201CAnd my thanks to he who adds.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat have you brought for us from your strange lands, friend?\u201D Thresh said. \u201CMore metal, I hope?\u201D\r\nVstim waved and some of the guards brought over a heavy crate. They set it down and pried off the top, revealing its peculiar contents. Pieces of scrap metal, mostly shaped like bits of shell, though some were formed like pieces of wood. It looked to Rysn like garbage that had\u2014for some inexplicable reason\u2014been Soulcast into metal.\r\n\u201CAh,\u201D Thresh said, squatting down to inspect the box. \u201CWonderful!\u201D\r\n\u201CNot a bit of it was mined,\u201D Vstim said. \u201CNo rocks were broken or smelted to get this metal, Thresh. It was Soulcast from shells, bark, or branches. I have a document sealed by five separate Thaylen notaries attesting to it.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou needn\u2019t have done such a thing as this,\u201D Thresh said. \u201CYou have once earned our trust in this matter long ago.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019d rather be proper about it,\u201D Vstim said. \u201CA merchant who is careless with contracts is one who finds himself with enemies instead of friends.\u201D\r\nThresh stood up, clapping three times. The men in brown with the downcast eyes lowered the back of a wagon, revealing crates.\r\n\u201CThe others who visit us,\u201D Thresh noted, walking to the wagon. \u201CAll they seem to care about are horses. Everyone wishes to buy horses. But never you, my friend. Why is that?\u201D\r\n\u201CToo hard to care for,\u201D Vstim said, walking with Thresh. \u201CAnd there\u2019s too often a poor return on the investment, valuable as they are.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut not with these?\u201D Thresh said, picking up one of the light crates. There was something alive inside.\r\n\u201CNot at all,\u201D Vstim said. \u201CChickens fetch a good price, and they\u2019re easy to care for, assuming you have feed.\u201D\r\n\u201CWe brought you plenty,\u201D Thresh said. \u201CI cannot believe you buy these from us. They are not worth nearly so much as you outsiders think. And you give us metal for them! Metal that bears no stain of broken rock. A miracle.\u201D\r\nVstim shrugged. \u201CThose scraps are practically worthless where I come from. They\u2019re made by ardents practicing with Soulcasters. They can\u2019t make food, because if you get it wrong, it\u2019s poisonous. So they turn garbage into metal and throw it away.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut it can be forged!\u201D\r\n\u201CWhy forge the metal,\u201D Vstim said, \u201Cwhen you can carve an object from wood in the precise shape you want,\r\nthenSoulcast it?\u201D\r\nThresh just shook his head, bemused. Rysn watched with her own share of confusion. This was the\r\ncraziesttrade exchange she\u2019d ever seen. Normally, Vstim argued and haggled like a crushkiller. But here, he freely revealed that his wares were worthless!\r\nIn fact, as conversation proceeded, the two both took pains to explain how worthless their goods were. Eventually, they came to an agreement\u2014though Rysn couldn\u2019t grasp how\u2014and shook hands on the deal. Some of Thresh\u2019s soldiers began to unload their boxes of chickens, cloth, and exotic dried meats. Others began carting away boxes of scrap metal.\r\n\u201CYou couldn\u2019t trade me a soldier, could you?\u201D Vstim asked as they waited.\r\n\u201CThey cannot be sold to an outsider, I am afraid.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut there was that one you traded me\u2026\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s been nearly seven years!\u201D Thresh said with a laugh. \u201CAnd still you ask!\u201D\r\n\u201CYou don\u2019t know what I got for him,\u201D Vstim said. \u201CAnd you gave him to me for practically nothing!\u201D\r\n\u201CHe was Truthless,\u201D Thresh said, shrugging. \u201CHe wasn\u2019t worth anything at all. You\r\nforcedme to take something in trade, though to confess, I had to throw your payment into a river. I could not take money for a Truthless.\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, I suppose I can\u2019t take offense at that,\u201D Vstim said, rubbing his chin. \u201CBut if you ever have another, let me know. Best servant I ever had. I still regret that I traded him.\u201D\r\n\u201CI will remember, friend,\u201D Thresh said. \u201CBut I do not think it likely we will have another like him.\u201D He seemed to grow distracted. \u201CIndeed, I should hope that we never do\u2026.\u201D\r\nOnce the goods were exchanged, they shook hands again, then Vstim bowed to the farmer. Rysn tried to mimic what he did, and earned a smile from Thresh and several of his companions, who chattered in their whispering Shin language.\r\nSuch a long, boring ride for such a short exchange. But Vstim was right; those chickens would be worth good spheres in the East.\r\n\u201CWhat did you learn?\u201D Vstim said to her as they walked back toward the lead wagon.\r\n\u201CThat Shin are odd.\u201D\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D Vstim said, though he wasn\u2019t stern. He never seemed to be stern. \u201CThey are simply different, child. Odd people are those who act erratically. Thresh and his kind, they are anything but erratic. They may be a little\r\ntoostable. The world is changing outside, but the Shin seem determined to remain the same. I\u2019ve tried to offer them fabrials, but they find them worthless. Or unholy. Or too holy to use.\u201D\r\n\u201CThose are rather different things, master.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D he said. \u201CBut with the Shin, it\u2019s often hard to distinguish among them. Regardless, what did you\r\nreallylearn?\u201D\r\n\u201CThat they treat being humble like the Herdazians treat boasting,\u201D she said. \u201CYou both went out of your way to show how worthless your wares were. I found it strange, but I think it might just be how they haggle.\u201D\r\nHe smiled widely. \u201CAnd already you are wiser than half the men I\u2019ve brought here. Listen. Here is your lesson.\r\nNevertry to cheat the Shin. Be forthright, tell them the truth, and\u2014if anything\u2014undervalue your goods. They will love you for it. And they\u2019ll pay you for it too.\u201D\r\nShe nodded. They reached the wagon, and he got out a strange little pot. \u201CHere,\u201D he said. \u201CUse a knife and go cut out some of that grass. Be sure to cut down far and get plenty of the soil. The plants can\u2019t live without it.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhy am I doing this?\u201D she asked, wrinkling her nose and taking the pot.\r\n\u201CBecause,\u201D he said. \u201CYou\u2019re going to learn to care for that plant. I want you to keep it with you until you stop thinking of it as odd.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut why?\u201D\r\n\u201CBecause it will make you a better merchant,\u201D he said.\r\nShe frowned. Must he be so strange so much of the time? Perhaps that was why he was one of the only Thaylens who could get a good deal out of the Shin. He was as odd as they were.\r\nShe walked off to do as she was told. No use complaining. She did get out a rugged pair of gloves first, though, and roll up her sleeves. She was\r\nnotgoing to ruin a good dress for a pot of drooling, wall-staring, imbecile grass. And that was that."

      "ChapterName": "1-5: AXIES THE COLLECTOR",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\nAxies the Collector groaned, lying on his back, skull pounding with a headache. He opened his eyes and looked down the length of his body. He was naked.\r\nBlight it all,he thought.\r\nWell, best to check and see if he was hurt too badly. His toes pointed at the sky. The nails were a deep blue color, not uncommon for an Aimian man like himself. He tried to wiggle them and, pleasingly, they actually moved.\r\n\u201CWell, that\u2019s something,\u201D he said, dropping his head back to the ground. It made a squishing sound as it touched something soft, likely a bit of rotting garbage.\r\nYes, that was what it was. He could smell it now, pungent and rank. He focused on his nose, sculpting his body so that he could no longer smell.\r\nAh,he thought.\r\nMuch better.\r\nNow if he could only banish the pounding in his head. Really, did the sun\r\nhaveto be so garish overhead? He closed his eyes.\r\n\u201CYou\u2019re still in my alley,\u201D a gruff voice said from behind him. That voice had awakened him in the first place.\r\n\u201CI shall vacate it presently,\u201D Axies promised.\r\n\u201CYou owe me rent. One night\u2019s sleep.\u201D\r\n\u201CIn an alleyway?\u201D\r\n\u201CFinest alleyway in Kasitor.\u201D\r\n\u201CAh. Is that where I am, then? Excellent.\u201D\r\nA few heartbeats of mental focus finally banished the headache. He opened his eyes, and this time found the sunlight quite pleasant. Brick walls rose toward the sky on either side of him, overgrown with a crusty red lichen. Small heaps of rotting tubers were scattered around him.\r\nNo. Not scattered. They looked to be arranged carefully. Odd, that. They were likely the source of the scents he\u2019d noticed earlier. Best to leave his sense of smell inhibited.\r\nHe sat up, stretching, checking his muscles. All seemed to be in working order, though he had quite a few bruises. He\u2019d deal with those in a bit. \u201CNow,\u201D he said, turning, \u201Cyou wouldn\u2019t happen to have a spare pair of pants, would you?\u201D\r\nThe owner of the voice turned out to be a scraggly-bearded man sitting on a box at the end of the alleyway. Axies didn\u2019t recognize him, nor did he recognize the location. That wasn\u2019t surprising, considering that he\u2019d been beaten, robbed, and left for dead. Again.\r\nThe things I do in the name of scholarship,he thought with a sigh.\r\nHis memory was returning. Kasitor was a large Iriali city, second in size only to Rall Elorim. He\u2019d come here by design. He\u2019d also gotten himself drunk by design. Perhaps he should have picked his drinking companions more carefully.\r\n\u201CI\u2019m going to guess that you don\u2019t have a spare pair of pants,\u201D Axies said, standing and inspecting the tattoos on his arm. \u201CAnd if you did, I\u2019d suggest that you wear them yourself. Is that a lavis sack you have on?\u201D\r\n\u201CYou owe me rent,\u201D the man grumbled. \u201CAnd payment for destroying the temple of the northern god.\u201D\r\n\u201COdd,\u201D Axies said, looking over his shoulder toward the alleyway\u2019s opening. There was a busy street beyond. The good people of Kasitor would likely not take well to his nudity. \u201CI don\u2019t\r\nrecalldestroying any temples. Normally I\u2019m quite cognizant of that sort of thing.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou took out half of Hapron Street,\u201D the beggar said. \u201CNumber of homes as well. I\u2019ll let that slide.\u201D\r\n\u201CMighty kind of you.\u201D\r\n\u201CThey\u2019ve been wicked lately.\u201D\r\nAxies frowned, looking back at the beggar. He followed the man\u2019s gaze, looking down at the ground. The heaps of rotting vegetables had been placed in a very particular arrangement. Like a city.\r\n\u201CAh,\u201D Axies said, moving his foot, which had been planted on a small square of vegetable.\r\n\u201CThat was a bakery,\u201D the beggar said.\r\n\u201CTerribly sorry.\u201D\r\n\u201CThe family was away.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s a relief.\u201D\r\n\u201CThey were worshipping at the temple.\u201D\r\n\u201CThe one I\u2026\u201D\r\n\u201CSmashed with your head? Yes.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m certain you\u2019ll be kind to their souls.\u201D\r\nThe beggar narrowed his eyes at him. \u201CI\u2019m still trying to decide how you fit into things. Are you a Voidbringer or a Herald?\u201D\r\n\u201CVoidbringer, I\u2019m afraid,\u201D Axies said. \u201CI mean, I\r\ndiddestroy a temple.\u201D\r\nThe beggar\u2019s eyes grew more suspicious.\r\n\u201COnly the sacred cloth can banish me,\u201D Axies continued. \u201CAnd since you don\u2019t\u2026I say, what is that you\u2019re holding?\u201D\r\nThe beggar looked down at his hand, which was touching one of the ratty blankets draped over one of his equally ratty boxes. He perched atop them, like\u2026well, like a god looking down over his people.\r\nPoor fool,Axies thought. It was really time to be moving on. Wouldn\u2019t want to bring any bad luck down upon the addled fellow.\r\nThe beggar held up the blanket. Axies shied back, raising his hands. That made the beggar smile a grin that could have used a few more teeth. He hopped off his box, holding the blanket up wardingly. Axies shied away.\r\nThe beggar cackled and threw the blanket at him. Axies snatched it from the air and shook a fist at the beggar. Then he retreated from the alleyway while wrapping the blanket around his waist.\r\n\u201CAnd lo,\u201D the beggar said from behind, \u201Cthe foul beast was banished!\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd lo,\u201D Axies said, fixing the blanket in place, \u201Cthe foul beast avoided imprisonment for public indecency.\u201D Iriali were very particular about their chastity laws. They were very particular about a lot of things. Of course, that could be said for most peoples\u2014the only difference were the things they were particular about.\r\nAxies the Collector drew his share of stares. Not because of his unconventional clothing\u2014Iri was on the northwestern rim of Roshar, and its weather therefore tended to be much warmer than that of places like Alethkar or even Azir. A fair number of the golden-haired Iriali men went about wearing only waist wraps, their skin painted various colors and patterns. Even Axies\u2019s tattoos weren\u2019t that noteworthy here.\r\nPerhaps he drew stares because of his blue nails and crystalline deep blue eyes. Aimians\u2014even Siah Aimians\u2014were rare. Or perhaps it was because he cast a shadow the wrong way. Toward light, instead of away from it. It was a small thing, and the shadows weren\u2019t long, with the sun so high. But those who noticed muttered or jumped out of the way. Likely they\u2019d heard of his kind. It hadn\u2019t been\r\nthatlong since the scouring of his homeland. Just long ago enough for stories and legends to have crept into the general knowledge of most peoples.\r\nPerhaps someone important would take exception to him and have him brought before a local magistrate. Wouldn\u2019t be the first time. He\u2019d learned long ago not to worry. When the Curse of Kind followed you, you learned to take what happened as it happened.\r\nHe began to whistle softly to himself, inspecting his tattoos and ignoring those observant enough to gawk.\r\nI remember writing something somewhere\u2026he thought, looking over his wrist, then twisting his arm over and trying to see if there were any new tattoos on the back. Like all Aimians, he could change the color and markings of his skin at will. That was convenient, as when you were very regularly robbed of everything you owned, it was blighted difficult to keep a proper notebook. And so, he kept his notes on his skin, at least until he could return to a safe location and transcribe them.\r\nHopefully, he hadn\u2019t gotten so drunk that he\u2019d written his observations someplace inconvenient. He\u2019d done that once, and reading the mess had required two mirrors and a very confused bathing attendant.\r\nAh,he thought, discovering a new entry near the inside of his left elbow. He read it awkwardly, shuffling down the incline.\r\nTest successful. Have noted spren who appear only when one is severely intoxicated. Appear as small brown bubbles clinging to objects nearby. Further testing may be needed to prove they were more than a drunken hallucination.\r\n\u201CVery nice,\u201D he said out loud. \u201CVery nice indeed. I wonder what I should call them.\u201D The stories he\u2019d heard called them sudspren, but that seemed silly. Intoxicationspren? No, too unwieldy. Alespren? He felt a surge of excitement. He\u2019d been hunting this particular type of spren for years. If they proved real, it would be quite a victory.\r\nWhy did they appear only in Iri? And why so infrequently? He\u2019d gotten himself stupidly drunk a dozen times, and had only found them once. If, indeed, he had ever really found them.\r\nSpren, however, could be very elusive. Sometimes, even the most common types\u2014flamespren, for instance\u2014would refuse to appear. That made it particularly frustrating for a man who had made it his life\u2019s work to observe, catalogue, and study every single type of spren in Roshar.\r\nHe continued whistling as he made his way through the town to the dockside. Around him flowed large numbers of the golden-haired Iriali. The hair bred true, like black Alethi hair\u2014the purer your blood was, the more locks of gold you had. And it wasn\u2019t merely blond, it was truly gold, lustrous in the sun.\r\nHe had a fondness for the Iriali. They weren\u2019t\r\nnearlyas prudish as the Vorin peoples to the east, and were rarely inclined to bickering or fighting. That made it easier to hunt spren. Of course, there were also spren you could find only during war.\r\nA group of people had gathered at the docks.\r\nAh,he thought,\r\nexcellent. I\u2019m not too late.Most were crowding onto a purpose-built viewing platform. Axies found himself a place to stand, adjusted his holy blanket, and leaned back against the railing to wait.\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long. At precisely seven forty-six in the morning\u2014the locals could use it to set their timepieces\u2014an enormous, sea-blue spren surged from the waters of the bay. It was translucent, and though it appeared to throw out waves as it rose, that was illusory. The actual surface of the bay wasn\u2019t disturbed.\r\nIt takes the shape of a large jet of water,Axies thought, creating a tattoo along an open portion of his leg, scribing the words.\r\nThe center is of the deepest blue, like the ocean depths, though the outer edges are a lighter shade. Judging by the masts of the nearby ships, I\u2019d say that the spren has grown to a height of at least a hundred feet. One of the largest I\u2019ve ever seen.\r\nThe column sprouted four long arms that came down around the bay, forming fingers and thumbs. They landed on golden pedestals that had been placed there by the people of the city. The spren came at the same time every day, without fail.\r\nThey called it by name, Cusicesh, the Protector. Some worshipped it as a god. Most simply accepted it as part of the city. It was unique. One of the few types of spren he knew of that seemed to have only a single member.\r\nBut whatkind\r\nof spren is it?Axies wrote, fascinated.\r\nIt has formed a face, looking eastward. Directly toward the Origin. That face is shifting, bewilderingly quick. Different human faces appear on the end of its stumplike neck, one after another in blurred succession.\r\nThe display lasted a full ten minutes. Did any of the faces repeat? They changed so quickly, he couldn\u2019t tell. Some seemed male, others female. Once the display was finished, Cusicesh retreated down into the bay, sending up phantom waves again.\r\nAxies felt drained, as if something had been leeched from him. That was reported to be a common reaction. Was he imagining it because it was expected? Or was it real?\r\nAs he considered, a street urchin scrambled past and grabbed his wrap, yanking it free and laughing to himself. He tossed it to some friends and they scrambled away.\r\nAxies shook his head. \u201CWhat a bother,\u201D he said as people around him began to gasp and mutter. \u201CThere are guards nearby, I assume? Ah yes. Four of them. Wonderful.\u201D The four were already stalking toward him, golden hair falling around their shoulders, expressions stern.\r\n\u201CWell,\u201D he said to himself, making a final notation as one of the guards grabbed him on the shoulder. \u201CIt appears I\u2019ll have another chance to search for captivityspren.\u201D Odd, how those had eluded him all these years, despite his numerous incarcerations. He was beginning to consider them mythological.\r\nThe guards towed him off toward the city dungeons, but he didn\u2019t mind. Two new spren in as many days! At this rate, it might only take a few more centuries to complete his research.\r\nGrand indeed. He resumed whistling to himself."

      "ChapterName": "1-6: A WORK OF ART",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\nSzeth-son-son-Vallano, Truthless of Shinovar, crouched on a high stone ledge at the side of the gambling den. The ledge was meant for holding a lantern; both his legs and the shelf were hidden by his long, enveloping cloak, making him seem to be hanging from the wall.\r\nThere were few lights nearby. Makkek liked Szeth to remain cloaked in shadow. He wore a formfitting black costume beneath the cloak, the lower part of his face covered by a cloth mask; both were of Makkek\u2019s design. The cloak was too big and the clothing too tight. It was a terrible outfit for an assassin, but Makkek demanded drama, and Szeth did as his master commanded. Always.\r\nPerhaps there was something useful to the drama. With only his eyes and bald head showing, he unnerved the people who passed by. Shin eyes, too round, slightly too large. The people here thought them similar to the eyes of a child. Why did that disturb them so?\r\nNearby, a group of men in brown cloaks sat chatting and rubbing their thumbs and forefingers together. Wisps of smoke rose between their fingers, accompanied by a faint crackling sound. Rubbing firemoss was said to make a man\u2019s mind more receptive to thoughts and ideas. The one time Szeth had tried it, it had given him a headache and two blistered fingers. But once you grew the calluses, it could apparently be euphoric.\r\nThe circular den had a bar at the center, serving a wide variety of drinks at a wider variety of prices. The barmaids were dressed in violet robes that had plunging necklines and were open at the sides. Their safehands were exposed, something that the Bavlanders\u2014who were Vorin by descent\u2014seemed to find extremely provocative. So odd. It was just a hand.\r\nAround the perimeter of the den, various games were in progress. None of them were overt games of chance\u2014no dice throws, no bets on card flips. There were games of breakneck, shallowcrab fights, and\u2014oddly\u2014guessing games. That was another oddity about Vorin peoples; they avoided overtly guessing the future. A game like breakneck would have throws and tosses, but they wouldn\u2019t bet on the outcome. Instead, they\u2019d bet on the hand they held after the throws and the draws.\r\nIt seemed a meaningless distinction to Szeth, but it was deeply steeped in the culture. Even here, in one of the vilest pits in the city\u2014where women walked with their hands exposed and men spoke openly of crimes\u2014nobody risked offending the Heralds by seeking to know the future. Even predicting the highstorms made many uncomfortable. And yet they thought\r\nnothingof walking on stone or using Stormlight for everyday illumination. They ignored the spirits of things that lived around them, and they ate whatever they wanted on any day they wanted.\r\nStrange. So strange. And yet this was his life. Recently, Szeth had begun to question some of the prohibitions he had once followed so strictly. How could these Easterners\r\nnotwalk on stone? There was no soil in their lands. How could they get about without treading on stone?\r\nDangerous thoughts. His way of life was all that remained to him. If he questioned Stone Shamanism, would he then question his nature as Truthless? Dangerous, dangerous. Though his murders and sins would damn him, at least his soul would be given to the stones upon his death. He would continue to exist. Punished, in agony, but not exiled to nothingness.\r\nBetter to exist in agony than to vanish entirely.\r\nMakkek himself strode the floor of the gambling den, a woman on each arm. His scrawny leanness was gone, his face having slowly gained a juicy plumpness, like a fruit ripening after the drowning\u2019s waters. Also gone were his ragged footpad\u2019s garments, replaced with luxurious silks.\r\nMakkek\u2019s companions\u2014the ones with him when they\u2019d killed Took\u2014were all dead, murdered by Szeth at Makkek\u2019s orders. All to hide the secret of the Oathstone. Why were these Easterners always so ashamed of the way they controlled Szeth? Was it because they feared another would steal the Oathstone from them? Were they terrified that the weapon they employed so callously would be turned against them?\r\nPerhaps he feared that if it were known how easily Szeth was controlled, it would spoil their reputation. Szeth had overheard more than one conversation centered around the mystery of Makkek\u2019s terribly effective bodyguard. If a creature like Szeth served Makkek, then the master himself must be even more dangerous.\r\nMakkek passed the place where Szeth lurked, one of the women on his arms laughing with tinkling sound. Makkek glanced at Szeth, then gestured curtly. Szeth bowed his masked head in acknowledgment. He slid from his place, dropping to the ground, oversized cloak fluttering.\r\nGames stilled. Men both drunken and sober turned to watch Szeth, and as he passed the three men with the firemoss, their fingers went limp. Most in the room knew what Szeth was about this night. A man had moved into Bornwater and opened his own gambling den to challenge Makkek. Likely this newcomer didn\u2019t believe the reputation of Makkek\u2019s phantom assassin. Well, he had reason to be skeptical. Szeth\u2019s reputation\r\nwasinaccurate.\r\nHe was far,\r\nfarmore dangerous than it suggested.\r\nHe ducked out of the gambling den, passing up the steps through the darkened storefront and then out into the yard. He tossed the cloak and face mask into a wagon as he passed. The cloak would only make noise, and why cover his face? He was the only Shin in town. If someone saw his eyes, they\u2019d know who he was. He retained the tight black clothing; changing would take too much time.\r\nBornwater was the largest town in the area; it hadn\u2019t taken Makkek long to outgrow Staplind. Now he was talking of moving up to Kneespike, the city where the local landlord had his mansion. If that happened, Szeth would spend months wading in blood as he systematically tracked down and killed each and every thief, cutthroat, and gambling master who refused Makkek\u2019s rule.\r\nThat was months off. For now, there was Bornwater\u2019s interloper, a man named Gavashaw. Szeth prowled through the streets, eschewing Stormlight or Shardblade, counting on his natural grace and care to keep him unseen. He enjoyed his brief freedom. These moments\u2014when he wasn\u2019t trapped in one of Makkek\u2019s smoke-filled dens\u2014were too few lately.\r\nSlipping between buildings\u2014moving swiftly in the darkness, with the wet, cold air on his skin\u2014he could almost think himself back in Shinovar. The buildings around him were not of blasphemous stone, but earthen ones, built with clay and soil. Those low sounds were not muffled cheers from within another of Makkek\u2019s gambling dens, but the thunder and whinnies of wild horses on the plains.\r\nBut no. In Shinovar he\u2019d never smelled refuse like that\u2014pungency compounded by weeks spent marinating. He was not home. There was no place for him in the Valley of Truth.\r\nSzeth entered one of the richer sections of town, where buildings had more space between homes. Bornwater was in a lait, protected by a towering cliffside to the east. Gavashaw had arrogantly made his home in a large mansion on the eastern side of town. It belonged to the provincial landlord; Gavashaw had his favor. The landlord had heard of Makkek and his quick rise to prominence in the underground, and supporting a rival was a good way to create an early check on Makkek\u2019s power.\r\nThe citylord\u2019s local mansion was three stories tall, with a stone wall surrounding the compact, neatly gardened grounds. Szeth approached in a low crouch. Here on the outskirts of town, the ground was spotted with bulbous rockbuds. As he passed, the plants rustled, pulling back their vines and lethargically closing their shells.\r\nHe reached the wall and pressed himself against it. It was the time between the first two moons, the darkest period of night. The hateful hour, his people called it, for it was one of the only times when the gods did not watch men. Soldiers walked the wall above, feet scraping the stones. Gavashaw probably thought himself safe in this building, which was secure enough for a powerful lighteyes.\r\nSzeth breathed in, infusing himself with Stormlight from the spheres in his pouch. He began to glow, luminescent vapors rising from his skin. In the darkness, it was quite noticeable. These powers had never been intended for assassination; Surgebinders had fought during the light of day, battling the night but not embracing it.\r\nThat was not Szeth\u2019s place. He would simply have to take extra care not to be seen.\r\nTen heartbeats after the passing of the guards, Szeth Lashed himself to the wall. That direction became down for him, and he was able to run up the side of the stone fortification. As he reached the top, he leaped forward, then briefly Lashed himself backward. He spun over the top of the wall in a tucked flip, then Lashed himself back to the wall again. He came down with feet planted on the stones, facing the ground. He ran and Lashed himself downward again, dropping the last few feet.\r\nThe grounds were laced with shalebark mounds, cultivated to form small terraces. Szeth ducked low, picking his way through the mazelike garden. There were guards at the building\u2019s doorways, watching by the light of spheres. How easy it would be to dash up, consume the Stormlight, and plunge the men into darkness before cutting them down.\r\nBut Makkek had not expressly commanded him to be so destructive. Gavashaw was to be assassinated, but the method was up to Szeth. He picked one that would not require killing the guards. That was what he always did, when given the chance. It was the only way to preserve what little humanity he had left.\r\nHe reached the western wall of the mansion and Lashed himself to it, then ran up it onto the roof. It was long and flat, sloped gently eastward\u2014an unnecessary feature in a lait, but Easterners saw the world by the light of the highstorms. Szeth quickly crossed to the rear of the building, to where a small rock dome covered a lower portion of the mansion. He dropped down onto the dome, Stormlight streaming from his body. Translucent, luminescent, pristine. Like the ghost of a fire burning from him, consuming his soul.\r\nHe summoned his Shardblade in the stillness and dark, then used it to slice a hole in the dome, angling his Blade so that the chunk of rock did not fall down inside. He reached down with his free hand and infused the stone circle with Light, Lashing it toward the northwest section of the sky. Lashing something to a distant point like that was possible, but imprecise. It was like trying to shoot an arrow a great distance.\r\nHe stepped back as the stone circle lurched free and fell up into the air, streaming Stormlight as it soared toward the splattered paint drops of stars above. Szeth leapt into the hole, then immediately Lashed himself to the ceiling. He twisted in the air, landing with his feet planted on the underside of the dome beside the lip of the hole he\u2019d cut. From his perspective, he was now standing at the bottom of a gigantic stone bowl, the hole cut in the very bottom, looking out on the stars beneath.\r\nHe walked up the side of the bowl, Lashing himself to the right. In seconds he was on the floor, reoriented so that the dome rose above him. Distantly, he heard a faint crashing: The chunk of stone, Stormlight exhausted, had fallen back to the ground. He had aimed it out of the town. Hopefully, it had not caused any accidental deaths.\r\nThe guards would now be distracted, searching for the source of the distant crash. Szeth breathed in deeply, draining his second pouch of gemstones. The light streaming from him became brighter, letting him see the room around him.\r\nAs he\u2019d suspected, it was empty. This was a rarely used feasting hall, with cold firepits, tables, and benches. The air was still, silent, and musty. Like that of a tomb. Szeth hurried to the door, slid his Shardblade between it and the frame, and sliced through the deadbolt. He eased the door open. The Stormlight rising from his body illuminated the dark hallway outside.\r\nEarly during his time with Makkek, Szeth had been careful not to use the Shardblade. As his tasks had grown more difficult, however, he\u2019d been forced to resort to it to avoid unnecessary killing. Now the rumors about him were populated with tales of holes cut through stone and dead men with burned eyes.\r\nMakkek had begun to believe those rumors. He hadn\u2019t yet demanded that Szeth relinquish the Blade\u2014if he did so, he would discover the second of Szeth\u2019s two forbidden actions. He was required to carry the Blade until his death, after which Shin Stone Shamans would recover it from whomever had killed him.\r\nHe moved through the hallways. He wasn\u2019t worried about Makkek taking the Blade, but he\r\nwasworried about how bold the thief lord was growing. The more successful Szeth was, the more audacious Makkek became. How long before he stopped using Szeth to kill minor rivals, instead sending him to kill Shardbearers or powerful lighteyes? How long before someone made the connection? A Shin assassin with a Shardblade, capable of mysterious feats and extreme stealth? Could this be the now-infamous Assassin in White? Makkek could draw the Alethi king and highprinces away from their war on the Shattered Plains and bring them crashing down upon Jah Keved. Thousands would die. Blood would fall like the rain of a highstorm\u2014thick, pervasive, destructive.\r\nHe continued down the hallway in a swift low run, Shardblade carried in a reverse grip, extending out behind him. Tonight, at least, he assassinated a man who deserved his fate. Were the hallways too quiet? Szeth hadn\u2019t seen a soul since leaving the rooftop. Could Gavashaw have been foolish enough to place all of his guards outside, leaving his bedchamber undefended?\r\nAhead, the doors into the master\u2019s rooms lay unwatched and dark at the end of a short hallway. Suspicious.\r\nSzeth crept up to the doors, listening. Nothing. He hesitated, glancing to the side. A grand stairway led up to the second floor. He hustled over and used his Blade to shear free a wooden knob from the newel post. It was about the size of a small melon. A few hacks with the Blade cut a cloak-sized section of drapery free from a window. Szeth hurried back to the doors and infused the wooden sphere with Stormlight, giving it a Basic Lashing that pointed it westward, directly ahead of him.\r\nHe cut through the latch between the doors and eased one open. The room beyond was dark. Was Gavashaw gone for the evening? Where would he go? This city was not safe for him yet.\r\nSzeth placed the wooden ball in the middle of the drape, then held it up and dropped it. It fell forward, toward the far wall. Wrapped in the fabric, the ball looked vaguely like a person in a cloak running through the room in a crouch.\r\nNo concealed guards struck at it. The decoy bounced off a latched window, then came to rest hanging against the wall. It continued to leak Stormlight.\r\nThat light illuminated a small table with an object atop it. Szeth squinted, trying to make out what it was. He edged forward, slinking into the room, closer and closer to the table.\r\nYes. The object on the table was a head. One with Gavashaw\u2019s features. Shadows thrown by Stormlight gave the grisly face an even more haunted cast. Someone had beaten Szeth to the assassination.\r\n\u201CSzeth-son-Neturo,\u201D a voice said.\r\nSzeth turned, spinning his Shardblade around and falling into a defensive stance. A figure stood on the far side of the room, shrouded in the darkness. \u201CWho are you?\u201D Szeth demanded, his Stormlight aura growing brighter once he stopped holding his breath.\r\n\u201CAre you satisfied with this, Szeth-son-Neturo?\u201D the voice asked. It was male and deep. What was that accent? The man wasn\u2019t Veden. Alethi, perhaps? \u201CAre you satisfied with trivial crimes? Killing over meaningless turf in backwater mining villages?\u201D\r\nSzeth didn\u2019t reply. He scanned the room, looking for motion in the other shadows. None seemed to be hiding anyone.\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve watched you,\u201D the voice said. \u201CYou\u2019ve been sent to intimidate shopkeepers. You\u2019ve killed footpads so unimportant even the authorities ignore them. You\u2019ve been shown off to impress whores, as if they were high lighteyed ladies. What a waste.\u201D\r\n\u201CI do as my master demands.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou are squandered,\u201D the voice said. \u201CYou are not meant for petty extortions and murders. Using you like this, it\u2019s like hitching a Ryshadium stallion to a run-down market wagon. It\u2019s like using a Shardblade to slice vegetables, or like using the finest parchment as kindling for a washwater fire. It is a\r\ncrime. You are a work of art, Szeth-son-Neturo, a god. And each day Makkek throws dung at you.\u201D\r\n\u201CWho are you?\u201D Szeth repeated.\r\n\u201CAn admirer of the arts.\u201D\r\n\u201CDo not call me by my father\u2019s name,\u201D Szeth said. \u201CHe should not be sullied by association with me.\u201D\r\nThe sphere on the wall finally ran out of Stormlight, dropping to the floor, the drapery muffling its fall. \u201CVery well,\u201D the figure said. \u201CBut do you not rebel against this frivolous use of your skills? Were you not meant for greatness?\u201D\r\n\u201CThere is no greatness in killing,\u201D Szeth said. \u201CYou speak like a\r\nkukori. Great men create food and clothing. He who adds is to be revered. I am he who takes away. At least in the killing of men such as these I can pretend to be doing a service.\u201D\r\n\u201CThis from the man who nearly toppled one of the greatest kingdoms in Roshar?\u201D\r\n\u201CThis from the man who committed one of the most heinous slaughters in Roshar,\u201D Szeth corrected.\r\nThe figure snorted. \u201CWhat you did was a mere breeze compared to the storm of slaughter Shardbearers wreak on a battlefield each day. And\r\nthoseare breezes compared to the tempests you are capable of.\u201D\r\nSzeth began to walk away.\r\n\u201CWhere are you going?\u201D the figure asked.\r\n\u201CGavashaw is dead. I must return to my master.\u201D\r\nSomething hit the floor. Szeth spun, Shardblade down. The figure had dropped something round and heavy. It rolled across the floor toward Szeth.\r\nAnother head. It came to rest on its side. Szeth froze as he made out the features. The pudgy cheeks were stained with blood, the dead eyes wide with shock: Makkek.\r\n\u201CHow?\u201D Szeth demanded.\r\n\u201CWe took him seconds after you left the gambling den.\u201D\r\n\u201CWe?\u201D\r\n\u201CServants of your new master.\u201D\r\n\u201CMy Oathstone?\u201D\r\nThe figure opened his hand, revealing a gemstone suspended in his palm by a chain wrapped around his fingers. Sitting beside it, now illuminated, was Szeth\u2019s Oathstone. The figure\u2019s face was dark; he wore a mask.\r\nSzeth dismissed his Shardblade and went down on one knee. \u201CWhat are your orders?\u201D\r\n\u201CThere is a list on the table,\u201D the figure said, closing his hand and hiding the Oathstone. \u201CIt details our master\u2019s wishes.\u201D\r\nSzeth rose and walked over. Beside the head, which rested on a plate to contain the blood, was a sheet of paper. He took it, and his Stormlight illuminated some two dozen names written in the warrior\u2019s script of his homeland. Some had a note beside them with instructions on how they were to be killed.\r\nGlories within,Szeth thought. \u201CThese are some of the most powerful people in the world! Six highprinces? A Selay gerontarch? The\r\nkingof Jah Keved?\u201D\r\n\u201CIt is time you stopped wasting your talent,\u201D the figure said, walking to the far wall, resting his hand upon it.\r\n\u201CThis will cause chaos,\u201D Szeth whispered. \u201CInfighting. War. Confusion and pain such as the world has rarely known.\u201D\r\nThe chained gemstone on the man\u2019s palm flashed. The wall vanished, turned to smoke. A Soulcaster.\r\nThe dark figure glanced at Szeth. \u201CIndeed. Our master directs that you are to use tactics similar to those you employed so well in Alethkar years ago. When you are done, you will receive further instructions.\u201D\r\nHe then exited through the opening, leaving Szeth horrified. This was his nightmare. To be in the hands of those who understood his capabilities and who had the ambition to use them properly. He stood for a time, silent, long past when his Stormlight ran out.\r\nThen, reverently, he folded the list. He was surprised that his hands were so steady. He should be trembling.\r\nFor soon the world itself would shake."

      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\n\u201CThe ones of ash and fire, who killed like a swarm, relentless before the Heralds.\u201D\r\n\u2014Noted in Masly, page 337. Corroborated by Coldwin and Hasavah.\r\nIt sounds like you\u2019re getting into Jasnah\u2019s good graces quickly,the spanreed wrote out.\r\nHow long before you can make the switch?\r\nShallan grimaced, turning the gemstone on the reed.\r\nI don\u2019t know,she wrote back.\r\nJasnah keeps a close watch on the Soulcaster, as you\u2019d expect. She wears it all day. At night, she locks it away in her safe and wears the key around her neck.\r\nShe turned the gemstone, then waited for a reply. She was in her chamber, a small, stone-carved room inside Jasnah\u2019s quarters. Her accommodations were austere: A small bed, a nightstand, and the writing table were her only furniture. Her clothing remained in the trunk she had brought. No rug adorned the floor, and there were no windows, as the rooms were in the Kharbranthian Conclave, which was underground.\r\nThat does make it troubling,the reed wrote. Eylita\u2014Nan Balat\u2019s betrothed\u2014was the one doing the writing, but all three of Shallan\u2019s surviving brothers would be in the room back in Jah Keved, contributing to the conversation.\r\nI\u2019m guessing she takes it off while bathing,Shallan wrote.\r\nOnce she trusts me more, she may begin using me as a bathing attendant. That may present an opportunity.\r\nThat is a good plan,the spanreed wrote.\r\nNan Balat wants me to point out that we are very sorry to make you do this. It must be difficult for you to be away so long.\r\nDifficult? Shallan picked up the spanreed and hesitated.\r\nYes, it was difficult. Difficult not to fall in love with the freedom, difficult not to get too absorbed in her studies. It had been only two months since she\u2019d convinced Jasnah to take her as a ward, but already she felt half as timid and twice as confident.\r\nThe most difficult thing of all was knowing that it would soon end. Coming to study in Kharbranth was, without doubt, the most wonderful thing that had ever happened to her.\r\nI will manage,she wrote.\r\nYou are the ones living the difficult life, maintaining our family\u2019s interests at home. How are you doing?\r\nIt took time for them to reply.\r\nPoorly,Eylita finally sent.\r\nYour father\u2019s debts are coming due, and Wikim can barely keep the creditors distracted. The highprince ails, and everyone wants to know where our house stands on the question of succession. The last of the quarries is running out. If it becomes known that we no longer have resources, it will go badly for us.\r\nShallan grimaced.\r\nHow long do I have?\r\nA few more months, at best,Nan Balat sent back via his betrothed.\r\nIt depends on how long the highprince lasts and whether or not anyone realizes why Asha Jushu is selling our possessions.Jushu was the youngest of the brothers, just older than Shallan. His old gambling habit was actually coming in handy. For years, he\u2019d been stealing things from their father and selling them to cover his losses. He pretended he was still doing that, but he brought the money back to help. He was a good man, despite his habit. And, all things considered, he really couldn\u2019t be blamed for much of what he\u2019d done. None of them could.\r\nWikim thinks that he can keep everyone at bay for a while longer. But we are getting desperate. The sooner you return with the Soulcaster, the better.\r\nShallan hesitated, then wrote,\r\nAre we certain this is the best way? Perhaps we should simply ask Jasnah for help.\r\nYou think she would respond to that?they wrote back.\r\nShe would help an unknown and disliked Veden house? She would keep our secrets?\r\nProbably not. Though Shallan was increasingly certain that Jasnah\u2019s reputation was exaggerated, the woman did have a ruthless side to her. She would not leave her important studies to go help Shallan\u2019s family.\r\nShe reached for the reed to reply, but it started scribbling again.\r\nShallan,it said.\r\nThis is Nan Balat; I have sent the others away. It is only Eylita and me writing you now. There is something you need to know. Luesh is dead.\r\nShallan blinked in surprise. Luesh, her father\u2019s steward, had been the one who had known how to use the Soulcaster. He was one of the few people she and her brothers had determined they could trust.\r\nWhat happened?she wrote after switching to a new sheet of paper.\r\nHe died in his sleep, and there\u2019s no reason to suspect he was killed. But Shallan, a few weeks after his passing, some men visited here claiming to be friends of our father. In private with me, they implied they knew of Father\u2019s Soulcaster and suggestedstrongly\r\nthat I was to return it to them.\r\nShallan frowned. She still carried her father\u2019s broken Soulcaster in the safepouch of her sleeve.\r\nReturn it?she wrote.\r\nWe never did figure out where Father got it,Nan Balat sent.\r\nShallan, he was involved in something. Those maps, the things Luesh said, and now this. We continue to pretend that Father is alive, and occasionally he gets letters from other lighteyes that speak of vague \u201Cplans.\u201D I think he was going to make a play to become highprince. And he was supported by some very powerful forces.\r\nThese men who came, they were dangerous, Shallan. The type of men you do not cross. And they want their Soulcaster back. Whoever they are, I suspect they gave it to Father so he could create wealth and make a bid for the succession. They know he\u2019s dead.\r\nI believe that if we don\u2019t return a working Soulcaster to them, we could all be in serious danger. You need to bring Jasnah\u2019s fabrial to us. We\u2019ll quickly use it to create new quarries of valuable stone, and then we can give it up to these men. Shallan, you must succeed. I was hesitant about this plan when you suggested it, but other avenues are quickly vanishing.\r\nShallan felt a chill. She read over the paragraphs a few times, then wrote,\r\nIf Luesh is dead, then we don\u2019t know how to use the Soulcaster. That is problematic.\r\nI know,Nan Balat sent.\r\nSee if you can figure that out. This is dangerous, Shallan. I know it is. I\u2019m sorry.\r\nShe took a deep breath.\r\nIt must be done,she wrote.\r\nHere,Nan Balat sent.\r\nI wanted to show you something. Have you ever seen this symbol?The sketch that followed was crude. Eylita wasn\u2019t much of an artist. Fortunately, it was a simple picture\u2014three diamond shapes in a curious pattern.\r\nI\u2019ve never seen it,Shallan wrote.\r\nWhy?\r\nLuesh wore a pendant with this symbol on it,Nan Balat sent.\r\nWe found it on his body. And one of the men who came searching for the Soulcaster had the same pattern tattooed on his hand, just below his thumb.\r\nCurious,Shallan wrote.\r\nSo Luesh\u2026\r\nYes,Nan Balat sent.\r\nDespite what he said, I think he must have been the one who brought the Soulcaster to Father. Luesh was involved in this, perhaps as liaison between Father and the people backing him. I tried to suggest that they could back me instead, but the men just laughed. They did not stay long or give a specific time by which the Soulcaster must be returned. I doubt they\u2019d be satisfied to receive a broken one.\r\nShallan pursed her lips.\r\nBalat, have you thought that we might be risking a war? If it becomes known that we\u2019ve stolen an Alethi Soulcaster\u2026\r\nNo, there wouldn\u2019t be a war,Nan Balat wrote back.\r\nKing Hanavanar would just turn us over to the Alethi. They\u2019d execute us for the theft.\r\nWonderfully comforting, Balat,she wrote.\r\nThank you so much.\r\nYou\u2019re welcome. We\u2019re going to have to hope that Jasnah doesn\u2019t realize that you took the Soulcaster. It seems likely she\u2019ll assume that hers broke for some reason.\r\nShallan sighed.\r\nPerhaps,she wrote.\r\nTake care,Nan Balat sent her.\r\nYou too.\r\nAnd that was it. She set the spanreed aside, then read over the entire conversation, memorizing it. Then she crumpled up the sheets and walked into the sitting room of Jasnah\u2019s quarters. She wasn\u2019t there\u2014Jasnah rarely broke from her studies\u2014so Shallan burned the conversation in the hearth.\r\nShe stood for a long moment, watching the fire. She was worried. Nan Balat was capable, but they all bore scars from the lives they\u2019d led. Eylita was the only scribe they could trust, and she\u2026well, she was incredibly nice but not very clever.\r\nWith a sigh, Shallan left the room to return to her studies. Not only would they help get her mind off her troubles, but Jasnah would grow testy if she dallied too long.\r\nFive hours later, Shallan wondered why it was she\u2019d been so eager.\r\nShe\r\ndidenjoy her chances at scholarship. But recently, Jasnah had set her to study the history of the Alethi monarchy. It wasn\u2019t the most interesting subject around. Her boredom was compounded by her being forced to read a number of books that expressed opinions she found ridiculous.\r\nShe sat in Jasnah\u2019s alcove at the Veil. The enormous wall of lights, alcoves, and mysterious researchers no longer awed her. The place was becoming comfortable and familiar. She was alone at the moment.\r\nShallan rubbed her eyes with her freehand, then slid her book closed. \u201CI,\u201D she muttered, \u201Cam really coming to hate the Alethi monarchy.\u201D\r\n\u201CIs that so?\u201D a calm voice said from behind. Jasnah walked past, wearing a sleek violet dress, followed by a parshman porter with a stack of books. \u201CI\u2019ll try not to take it personally.\u201D\r\nShallan winced, then blushed furiously. \u201CI didn\u2019t mean\r\nindividually, Brightness Jasnah. I meant categorically.\u201D\r\nJasnah lithely took her seat in the alcove. She raised an eyebrow at Shallan, then gestured for the parshman to set down his burden.\r\nShallan still found Jasnah an enigma. At times, she seemed a stern scholar annoyed by Shallan\u2019s interruptions. At other times, there seemed to be a hint of wry humor hiding behind the stern facade. Either way, Shallan was finding that she felt remarkably comfortable around the woman. Jasnah encouraged her to speak her mind, something Shallan had taken to gladly.\r\n\u201CI assume from your outburst that this topic is wearing on you,\u201D Jasnah said, sorting through her volumes as the parshman withdrew. \u201CYou expressed interest in being a scholar. Well, you must learn that this\r\nisscholarship.\u201D\r\n\u201CReading argument after argument from people who refuse to see any other point of view?\u201D\r\n\u201CThey\u2019re confident.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m not an expert on confidence, Brightness,\u201D Shallan said, holding up a book and inspecting it critically. \u201CBut I\u2019d like to think that I could recognize it if it were before me. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the right word for books like this one from Mederia. They feel more arrogant than confident to me.\u201D She sighed, setting the book aside. \u201CTo be honest, \u2018arrogant\u2019 doesn\u2019t feel like quite the right word. It\u2019s not specific enough.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd what\r\nwouldbe the right word, then?\u201D\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know. \u2018Errorgant,\u2019 perhaps.\u201D\r\nJasnah raised a skeptical eyebrow.\r\n\u201CIt means to be twice as certain as someone who is merely arrogant,\u201D Shallan said, \u201Cwhile possessing only one-tenth the requisite facts.\u201D\r\nHer words drew a hint of a smile from Jasnah. \u201CWhat you are reacting against is known as the Assuredness Movement, Shallan. This\r\nerrorganceis a literary device. The scholars are intentionally overstating their case.\u201D\r\n\u201CThe Assuredness Movement?\u201D Shallan asked, holding up one of her books. \u201CI guess I could get behind that.\u201D\r\n\u201COh?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes. Much easier to stab it in the back from that position.\u201D\r\nThat got only an eyebrow raise. So, more seriously, Shallan continued. \u201CI suppose I can understand the device, Brightness, but these books you\u2019ve given me on King Gavilar\u2019s death are more and more irrational in defending their points. What began as a rhetorical conceit seems to have descended into name-calling and squabbling.\u201D\r\n\u201CThey are trying to provoke discussion. Would you rather that the scholars hide from the truth, like so many? You would have men prefer ignorance?\u201D\r\n\u201CWhen reading these books, scholarship and ignorance feel much alike to me,\u201D Shallan said. \u201CIgnorance may reside in a man hiding from intelligence, but scholarship can seem ignorance hidden behind intelligence.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd what of intelligence without ignorance? Finding truth while not dismissing the possibility of being wrong?\u201D\r\n\u201CA mythological treasure, Brightness, much like the Dawnshards or the Honorblades. Certainly worth seeking, but only with great caution.\u201D\r\n\u201CCaution?\u201D Jasnah said, frowning.\r\n\u201CIt would make you famous, but actually\r\nfindingit would destroy us all. Proof that one can be both intelligent\r\nandaccept the intelligence of those who disagree with you? Why, I should think it would undermine the scholarly world in its entirety.\u201D\r\nJasnah sniffed. \u201CYou go too far, child. If you took half the energy you devote to being witty and channeled it into your work, I daresay you could be one of the greatest scholars of our age.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m sorry, Brightness,\u201D Shallan said. \u201CI\u2026well, I\u2019m confused. Considering the gaps in my education, I assumed you would have me studying things deeper in the past than a few years ago.\u201D\r\nJasnah opened one of her books. \u201CI have found that youths like you have a relative lack of appreciation for the distant past. Therefore, I selected an area of study that is both more recent and sensational, to ease you into true scholarship. Is the murder of a king not of interest to you?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes, Brightness,\u201D Shallan said. \u201CWe children love things that are shiny and loud.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou have quite the mouth on you at times.\u201D\r\n\u201CAt times? You mean it\u2019s not there at others? I\u2019ll have to\u2026\u201D Shallan trailed off, then bit her lip, realizing she\u2019d gone too far. \u201CSorry.\u201D\r\n\u201CNever apologize for being clever, Shallan. It sets a bad precedent. However, one must apply one\u2019s wit with care. You often seem to say the first passably clever thing that enters your mind.\u201D\r\n\u201CI know,\u201D Shallan said. \u201CIt\u2019s long been a foible of mine, Brightness. One my nurses and tutors tried very hard to discourage.\u201D\r\n\u201CLikely through strict punishments.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes. Making me sit in the corner holding books over my head was the preferred method.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhich, in turn,\u201D Jasnah said with a sigh, \u201Conly trained you to make your quips\r\nmorequickly, for you knew you had to get them out before you could reconsider and suppress them.\u201D\r\nShallan cocked her head.\r\n\u201CThe punishments were incompetent,\u201D Jasnah said. \u201CUsed upon one such as yourself, they were actually encouragement. A game. How much would you have to say to earn a punishment? Could you say something so clever that your tutors missed the joke? Sitting in the corner just gave you more time to compose retorts.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut it\u2019s unseemly for a young woman to speak as I so often do.\u201D\r\n\u201CThe only \u2018unseemly\u2019 thing is to not channel your intelligence usefully. Consider. You have trained yourself to do something very similar to what annoys you in the scholars: cleverness without thought behind it\u2014intelligence, one might say, without a foundation of proper consideration.\u201D Jasnah turned a page. \u201CErrorgant, wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201D\r\nShallan blushed.\r\n\u201CI prefer my wards to be clever,\u201D Jasnah said. \u201CIt gives me more to work with. I should bring you to court with me. I suspect that Wit, at least, would find you amusing\u2014if only because your apparent natural timidity and your clever tongue make such an intriguing combination.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes, Brightness.\u201D\r\n\u201CPlease, just remember that a woman\u2019s mind is her most precious weapon. It must not be employed clumsily or prematurely. Much like the aforementioned knife to the back, a clever gibe is most effective when it is unanticipated.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m sorry, Brightness.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt wasn\u2019t an admonition,\u201D Jasnah said, turning a page. \u201CSimply an observation. I make them on occasion: Those books are musty. The sky is blue today. My ward is a smart-lipped reprobate.\u201D\r\nShallan smiled.\r\n\u201CNow, tell me what you\u2019ve discovered.\u201D\r\nShallan grimaced. \u201CNot much, Brightness. Or should I say too much? Each writer has her own theories on why the Parshendi killed your father. Some claim he must have insulted them at the feast that night. Others say that the entire treaty was a ruse, intended to get the Parshendi close to him. But that makes little sense, as they had much better opportunities earlier.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd the Assassin in White?\u201D Jasnah asked.\r\n\u201CA true anomaly,\u201D Shallan said. \u201CThe undertexts are filled with commentary about him. Why would the Parshendi hire an outside assassin? Did they fear they could not accomplish the job themselves? Or perhaps they didn\u2019t hire him, and were framed. Many think that is unlikely, considering that the Parshendi took credit for the murder.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd your thoughts?\u201D\r\n\u201CI feel inadequate to draw conclusions, Brightness.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat is the point of research if not to draw conclusions?\u201D\r\n\u201CMy tutors told me that supposition was only for the very experienced,\u201D Shallan explained.\r\nJasnah sniffed. \u201CYour tutors were idiots. Youthful immaturity is one of the cosmere\u2019s great catalysts for change, Shallan. Do you realize that the Sunmaker was only seventeen when he began his conquest? Gavarah hadn\u2019t reached her twentieth Weeping when she proposed the theory of the three realms.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut for every Sunmaker or Gavarah, are there not a hundred Gregorhs?\u201D He had been a youthful king notorious for beginning a pointless war with kingdoms that had been his father\u2019s allies.\r\n\u201CThere was only\r\noneGregorh,\u201D Jasnah said with a grimace, \u201Cthankfully. Your point is a valid one. Hence the purpose of education. To be young is about action. To be a scholar is about\r\ninformedaction.\u201D\r\n\u201COr about sitting in an alcove reading about a five-year-old murder.\u201D\r\n\u201CI would not have you studying this if there were no point to it,\u201D Jasnah said, opening up another of her own books. \u201CToo many scholars think of research as purely a cerebral pursuit. If we\r\ndonothing with the knowledge we gain, then we have wasted our study. Books can store information better than we can\u2014what we do that books cannot is\r\ninterpret. So if one is not going to draw conclusions, then one might as well just leave the information in the texts.\u201D\r\nShallan sat back, thoughtful. Presented that way, it somehow made her want to dig back into the studies. What was it that Jasnah wanted her to do with the information? Once again, she felt a stab of guilt. Jasnah was taking great pains to instruct her in scholarship, and she was going to reward the woman by stealing her most valuable possession and leaving a broken replacement. It made Shallan feel sick.\r\nShe had expected study beneath Jasnah to involve meaningless memorization and busywork, accompanied by chastisement for not being smart enough. That was how her tutors had approached her instruction. Jasnah was different. She gave Shallan a topic and the freedom to pursue it as she wished. Jasnah offered encouragement and speculation, but nearly all of their conversations turned to topics like the true nature of scholarship, the purpose of studying, the beauty of knowledge and its application.\r\nJasnah Kholin truly loved learning, and she wanted others to as well. Behind the stern gaze, intense eyes, and rarely smiling lips, Jasnah Kholin truly believed in what she was doing. Whatever that was.\r\nShallan raised one of her books, but covertly eyed the spines of Jasnah\u2019s latest stack of tomes. More histories about the Heraldic Epochs. Mythologies, commentaries, books by scholars known to be wild speculators. Jasnah\u2019s current volume was called\r\nShadows Remembered. Shallan memorized the title. She would try to find a copy and look through it.\r\nWhat was Jasnah pursuing? What secrets was she hoping to pry from these volumes, most of them centuries-old copies of copies? Though Shallan had discovered some secrets regarding the Soulcaster, the nature of Jasnah\u2019s quest\u2014the reason the princess had come to Kharbranth\u2014remained elusive. Maddeningly, yet tantalizingly, so. Jasnah liked to speak of the great women of the past, ones who had not just recorded history, but shaped it. Whatever it was she studied, she felt that it was important. World-changing.\r\nYou mustn\u2019t be drawn in,Shallan told herself, settling back with book and notes.\r\nYour goal is not to change the world. Your goal is to protect your brothers and your house.\r\nStill, she needed to make a good show of her wardship. And that gave her a reason to immerse herself for two hours until footsteps in the hallway interrupted. Likely the servants bringing the midday meal. Jasnah and Shallan often ate on their balcony.\r\nShallan\u2019s stomach grumbled as she smelled the food, and she gleefully set aside her book. She usually sketched at lunch, an activity that Jasnah\u2014despite her dislike of the visual arts\u2014encouraged. She said that highborn men often thought drawing and painting to be \u201Centicing\u201D in a woman, and so Shallan should maintain her skills, if only for the purpose of attracting suitors.\r\nShallan didn\u2019t know whether to find that insulting or not. And what did it say about Jasnah\u2019s own intentions for marriage that she herself never bothered with the more becoming feminine arts like music or drawing?\r\n\u201CYour Majesty,\u201D Jasnah said, rising smoothly.\r\nShallan started and looked hastily over her shoulder. The elderly king of Kharbranth was standing in the doorway, wearing magnificent orange and white robes with detailed embroidery. Shallan scrambled to her feet.\r\n\u201CBrightness Jasnah,\u201D the king said. \u201CAm I interrupting?\u201D\r\n\u201CYour company is never an interruption, Your Majesty,\u201D Jasnah said. She had to be as surprised as Shallan was, yet didn\u2019t display a moment of discomfort or anxiety. \u201CWe were soon to take lunch, anyway.\u201D\r\n\u201CI know, Brightness,\u201D Taravangian said. \u201CI hope you don\u2019t mind if I join you.\u201D A group of servants began bringing in food and a table.\r\n\u201CNot at all,\u201D Jasnah said.\r\nThe servants hurried to set things up, putting two different tablecloths on the round table to separate the genders during dining. They secured the half-moons of cloth\u2014red for the king, blue for the women\u2014with weights at the center. Covered plates filled with food followed: a clear, cold stew with sweet vegetables for the women, a spicy-smelling broth for the king. Kharbranthians preferred soups for their lunches.\r\nShallan was surprised to see them set a place for her. Her father had never eaten at the same table as his children\u2014even she, his favorite, had been relegated to her own table. Once Jasnah sat, Shallan did likewise. Her stomach growled again, and the king waved for them to begin. His motions seemed ungainly compared with Jasnah\u2019s elegance.\r\nShallan was soon eating contentedly\u2014with grace, as a woman should, safehand in her lap, using her freehand and a skewer to spear chunks of vegetable or fruit. The king slurped, but he wasn\u2019t as noisy as many men. Why had he deigned to visit? Wouldn\u2019t a formal dinner invitation have been more proper? Of course, she\u2019d learned that Taravangian wasn\u2019t known for his mastery of protocol. He was a popular king, beloved by the darkeyes as a builder of hospitals. However, the lighteyes considered him less than bright.\r\nHe was not an idiot. In lighteyed politics, unfortunately, being only average was a disadvantage. As they ate, the silence drew out, becoming awkward. Several times, the king looked as if he wanted to say something, but then turned back to his soup. He seemed intimidated by Jasnah.\r\n\u201CAnd how is your granddaughter, Your Majesty?\u201D Jasnah eventually asked. \u201CShe is recovering well?\u201D\r\n\u201CQuite well, thank you,\u201D Taravangian said, as if relieved to begin conversing. \u201CThough she now avoids the narrower corridors of the Conclave. I do want to thank you for your aid.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt is always fulfilling to be of service, Your Majesty.\u201D\r\n\u201CIf you will forgive my saying so, the ardents do not think much of your service,\u201D Taravangian said. \u201CI realize it is likely a sensitive topic. Perhaps I shouldn\u2019t mention it, but\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CNo, feel free,\u201D Jasnah said, eating a small green lurnip from the end of her skewer. \u201CI am not ashamed of my choices.\u201D\r\n\u201CThen you\u2019ll forgive an old man\u2019s curiosity?\u201D\r\n\u201CI always forgive curiosity, Your Majesty,\u201D Jasnah said. \u201CIt strikes me as one of the most genuine of emotions.\u201D\r\n\u201CThen where did you find it?\u201D Taravangian asked, nodding toward the Soulcaster, which Jasnah wore covered by a black glove. \u201CHow did you keep it from the devotaries?\u201D\r\n\u201COne might find those questions dangerous, Your Majesty.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve already acquired some new enemies by welcoming you.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou will be forgiven,\u201D Jasnah said. \u201CDepending on the devotary you have chosen.\u201D\r\n\u201CForgiven? Me?\u201D The elderly man seemed to find that amusing, and for a moment, Shallan thought she saw deep regret in his expression. \u201CUnlikely. But that is something else entirely. Please. I stand by my questions.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd I stand by my evasiveness, Your Majesty. I\u2019m sorry. I do forgive your curiosity, but I cannot reward it. These secrets are mine.\u201D\r\n\u201COf course, of course.\u201D The king sat back, looking embarrassed. \u201CNow you probably assume I brought this meal simply to ambush you about the fabrial.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou had another purpose, then?\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, you see, I\u2019ve heard the most wonderful things about your ward\u2019s artistic skill. I thought that maybe\u2026\u201D He smiled at Shallan.\r\n\u201COf course, Your Majesty,\u201D Shallan said. \u201CI\u2019d be happy to draw your likeness.\u201D\r\nHe beamed as she stood, leaving her meal half eaten and gathering her things. She glanced at Jasnah, but the older woman\u2019s face was unreadable.\r\n\u201CWould you prefer a simple portrait against a white background?\u201D Shallan asked. \u201COr would you prefer a broader perspective, including surroundings?\u201D\r\n\u201CPerhaps,\u201D Jasnah said pointedly, \u201Cyou should wait until the meal is finished, Shallan?\u201D\r\nShallan blushed, feeling a fool for her enthusiasm. \u201COf course.\u201D\r\n\u201CNo, no,\u201D the king said. \u201CI\u2019m quite finished. A wider sketch would be perfect, child. How would you like me to sit?\u201D He slid his chair back, posing and smiling in a grandfatherly way.\r\nShe blinked, fixing the image in her mind. \u201CThat is perfect, Your Majesty. You can return to your meal.\u201D\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t you need me to sit still? I\u2019ve posed for portraits before.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s all right,\u201D Shallan assured him, sitting down.\r\n\u201CVery well,\u201D he said, pulling back to the table. \u201CI do apologize for making you use me, of all people, as a subject for your art. This face of mine isn\u2019t the most impressive one you\u2019ve depicted, I\u2019m sure.\u201D\r\n\u201CNonsense,\u201D Shallan said. \u201CA face like yours is just what an artist needs.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt is?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes, the\u2014\u201D She cut herself off. She\u2019d been about to quip,\r\nYes, the skin is enough like parchment to make an ideal canvas.\u201C\u2026that handsome nose of yours, and wise furrowed skin. It will be quite striking in the black charcoal.\u201D\r\n\u201COh, well then. Proceed. Though I still can\u2019t see how you\u2019ll work without me holding a pose.\u201D\r\n\u201CBrightness Shallan has some unique talents,\u201D Jasnah said. Shallan began her sketch.\r\n\u201CI suppose that she must!\u201D the king said. \u201CI\u2019ve seen the drawing she did for Varas.\u201D\r\n\u201CVaras?\u201D Jasnah asked.\r\n\u201CThe Palanaeum\u2019s assistant chief of collections,\u201D the king said. \u201CA distant cousin of mine. He says the staff is quite taken with your young ward. How did you find her?\u201D\r\n\u201CUnexpectedly,\u201D Jasnah said, \u201Cand in need of an education.\u201D\r\nThe king cocked his head.\r\n\u201CThe artistic skill, I cannot claim,\u201D Jasnah said. \u201CIt was a preexisting condition.\u201D\r\n\u201CAh, a blessing of the Almighty.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou might say that.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut you would not, I assume?\u201D Taravangian chuckled awkwardly.\r\nShallan drew quickly, establishing the shape of his head. He shuffled uncomfortably. \u201CIs it hard for you, Jasnah? Painful, I mean?\u201D\r\n\u201CAtheism is not a disease, Your Majesty,\u201D Jasnah said dryly. \u201CIt\u2019s not as if I\u2019ve caught a foot rash.\u201D\r\n\u201COf course not, of course not. But\u2026er, isn\u2019t it difficult, having nothing in which to believe?\u201D\r\nShallan leaned forward, still sketching, but keeping her attention on the conversation. Shallan had assumed that training under a heretic would be a little more exciting. She and Kabsal\u2014the witty ardent whom she\u2019d met on her first day in Kharbranth\u2014had chatted several times now about Jasnah\u2019s faith. However, around Jasnah herself, the topic almost never came up. When it did, Jasnah usually changed it.\r\nToday, however, she did not. Perhaps she sensed the sincerity in the king\u2019s question. \u201CI wouldn\u2019t say that I have nothing to believe in, Your Majesty. Actually, I have much to believe in. My brother and my uncle, my own abilities. The things I was taught by my parents.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut, what is right and wrong, you\u2019ve\u2026Well, you\u2019ve discarded that.\u201D\r\n\u201CJust because I do not accept the teachings of the devotaries does not mean I\u2019ve discarded a belief in right and wrong.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut the\r\nAlmightydetermines what is right!\u201D\r\n\u201CMust someone, some unseen\r\nthing, declare what is right for it to\r\nberight? I believe that my own morality\u2014which answers only to my heart\u2014is more sure and true than the morality of those who do right only because they fear retribution.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut that is the soul of law,\u201D the king said, sounding confused. \u201CIf there is no punishment, there can be only chaos.\u201D\r\n\u201CIf there were no law, some men would do as they wish, yes,\u201D Jasnah said. \u201CBut isn\u2019t it remarkable that, given the chance for personal gain at the cost of others, so many people choose what is right?\u201D\r\n\u201CBecause they fear the Almighty.\u201D\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D Jasnah said. \u201CI think something innate in us understands that seeking the good of society is usually best for the individual as well. Humankind is noble, when we give it the chance to be. That nobility is something that exists independent of any god\u2019s decree.\u201D\r\n\u201CI just don\u2019t see how\r\nanythingcould be outside God\u2019s decrees.\u201D The king shook his head, bemused. \u201CBrightness Jasnah, I don\u2019t mean to argue, but isn\u2019t the very definition of the Almighty that all things exist because of him?\u201D\r\n\u201CIf you add one and one, that makes two, does it not?\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, yes.\u201D\r\n\u201CNo god needs declare it so for it to be true,\u201D Jasnah said. \u201CSo, could we not say that mathematics exists outside the Almighty, independent of him?\u201D\r\n\u201CPerhaps.\u201D\r\n\u201CWell,\u201D Jasnah said, \u201CI simply claim that morality and human will are independent of him too.\u201D\r\n\u201CIf you say that,\u201D the king said, chuckling, \u201Cthen you\u2019ve removed all purpose for the Almighty\u2019s existence!\u201D\r\n\u201CIndeed.\u201D\r\nThe balcony fell silent. Jasnah\u2019s sphere lamps cast a cool, even white light across them. For an uncomfortable moment, the only sound was the scratching of Shallan\u2019s charcoal on her drawing pad. She worked with quick, scraping motions, disturbed by the things that Jasnah had said. They made her feel hollow inside. That was partly because the king, for all his affability, was not good at arguing. He was a dear man, but no match for Jasnah in a conversation.\r\n\u201CWell,\u201D Taravangian said, \u201CI must say that you make your points quite effectively. I don\u2019t accept them, though.\u201D\r\n\u201CMy intention is not to convert, Your Majesty,\u201D Jasnah said. \u201CI am content keeping my beliefs to myself, something most of my colleagues in the devotaries have difficulty doing. Shallan, have you finished yet?\u201D\r\n\u201CQuite nearly, Brightness.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut it\u2019s been barely a few minutes!\u201D the king said.\r\n\u201CShe has remarkable skill, Your Majesty,\u201D Jasnah said. \u201CAs I believe I mentioned.\u201D\r\nShallan sat back, inspecting her piece. She\u2019d been so focused on the conversation, she\u2019d just let her hands do the drawing, trusting in her instincts. The sketch depicted the king, sitting in his chair with a wise expression, the turretlike balcony walls behind him. The doorway into the balcony was to his right. Yes, it was a good likeness. Not her best work, but\u2014\r\nShallan froze, her breath catching, her heart lurching in her chest. She had drawn\r\nsomethingstanding in the doorway behind the king. Two tall and willowy creatures with cloaks that split down the front and hung at the sides too stiffly, as if they were made of glass. Above the stiff, high collars, where the creatures\u2019 heads should be, each had a large, floating symbol of twisted design full of impossible angles and geometries.\r\nShallan sat, stunned. Why had she drawn those things? What had driven her to\u2014\r\nShe snapped her head up. The hallway was empty. The creatures hadn\u2019t been part of the Memory she\u2019d taken. Her hands had simply drawn them of their accord.\r\n\u201CShallan?\u201D Jasnah said.\r\nBy reflex, Shallan dropped her charcoal and grabbed the sheet in her freehand, crumpling it. \u201CI\u2019m sorry, Brightness. I paid too much attention to the conversation. I let myself grow sloppy.\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, certainly we can at least\r\nseeit, child,\u201D the king said, standing.\r\nShallan tightened her grip. \u201CPlease, no!\u201D\r\n\u201CShe has an artist\u2019s temperament at times, Your Majesty.\u201D Jasnah sighed. \u201CThere will be no getting it out of her.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll do you another, Your Majesty,\u201D Shallan said. \u201CI\u2019m\r\nsosorry.\u201D\r\nHe rubbed his wispy beard. \u201CYes, well, it was going to be a gift for my granddaughter\u2026.\u201D\r\n\u201CBy the end of the day,\u201D Shallan promised.\r\n\u201CThat would be wonderful. You\u2019re certain you don\u2019t need me to pose?\u201D\r\n\u201CNo, no, that won\u2019t be necessary, Your Majesty,\u201D Shallan said. Her pulse was still racing and she couldn\u2019t shake the image of those two distorted figures from her mind, so she took another Memory of the king. She could use that to create a more suitable picture.\r\n\u201CWell then,\u201D the king said. \u201CI suppose I should be going. I wish to visit one of the hospitals and the sick. You can send the drawing to my rooms, but take your time. Really, it is quite all right.\u201D\r\nShallan curtsied, crushed paper still held to her breast. The king withdrew with his attendants, several parshmen entering to remove the table.\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve never known you to make a mistake in drawing,\u201D Jasnah said, sitting back down at the desk. \u201CAt least not one so horrible that you destroyed the paper.\u201D\r\nShallan blushed.\r\n\u201CEven the master of an art may err, I suppose. Go ahead and take the next hour to do His Majesty a proper portrait.\u201D\r\nShallan looked down at the ruined sketch. The creatures were simply her fancy, the product of letting her mind wander. That was all. Just imagination. Perhaps there was something in her subconscious that she\u2019d needed to express. But what could the figures mean, then?\r\n\u201CI noticed that at one point when you were speaking to the king, you hesitated,\u201D Jasnah said. \u201CWhat didn\u2019t you say?\u201D\r\n\u201CSomething inappropriate.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut clever?\u201D\r\n\u201CCleverness never seems quite so impressive when regarded outside the moment, Brightness. It was just a silly thought.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd you replaced it with an empty compliment. I think you misunderstood what I was trying to explain, child. I do not wish for you to remain silent. It is good to be clever.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut if I\u2019d spoken,\u201D Shallan said, \u201CI\u2019d have insulted the king, perhaps confused him as well, which would have caused him embarrassment. I am certain he knows what people say about his slowness of thought.\u201D\r\nJasnah sniffed. \u201CIdle words. From foolish people. But perhaps it was wise not to speak, though keep in mind that\r\nchannelingyour capacities and\r\nstiflingthem are two separate things. I\u2019d much prefer you to think of something both clever and appropriate.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes, Brightness.\u201D\r\n\u201CBesides,\u201D Jasnah said, \u201CI believe you might have made Taravangian laugh. He seems haunted by something lately.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou don\u2019t find him dull, then?\u201D Shallan asked, curious. She herself didn\u2019t think the king dull or a fool, but she\u2019d thought someone as intelligent and learned as Jasnah might not have patience for a man like him.\r\n\u201CTaravangian is a wonderful man,\u201D Jasnah said, \u201Cand worth a hundred self-proclaimed experts on courtly ways. He reminds me of my uncle Dalinar. Earnest, sincere, concerned.\u201D\r\n\u201CThe lighteyes here say he\u2019s weak,\u201D Shallan said. \u201CBecause he panders to so many other monarchs, because he fears war, because he doesn\u2019t have a Shardblade.\u201D\r\nJasnah didn\u2019t reply, though she looked disturbed.\r\n\u201CBrightness?\u201D Shallan prodded, walking to her own seat and arranging her charcoals.\r\n\u201CIn ancient days,\u201D Jasnah said, \u201Ca man who brought peace to his kingdom was considered to be of great worth. Now that same man would be derided as a coward.\u201D She shook her head. \u201CIt has been centuries coming, this change. It should terrify us. We could do with more men like Taravangian, and I shall require you to never call him dull again, not even in passing.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes, Brightness,\u201D Shallan said, bowing her head. \u201CDid you really believe the things you said? About the Almighty?\u201D\r\nJasnah was quiet for a moment. \u201CI do. Though perhaps I overstated my conviction.\u201D\r\n\u201CThe Assuredness Movement of rhetorical theory?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D Jasnah said. \u201CI suppose that it was. I must be careful not to put my back toward you as I read today.\u201D\r\nShallan smiled.\r\n\u201CA true scholar must not close her mind close on any topic,\u201D Jasnah said, \u201Cno matter how certain she may feel. Just because I have not yet found a convincing reason to join one of the devotaries does not mean I never will. Though each time I have a discussion like the one today, my convictions grow firmer.\u201D\r\nShallan bit her lip. Jasnah noticed the expression. \u201CYou will need to learn to control that, Shallan. It makes your feelings obvious.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes, Brightness.\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, out with it.\u201D\r\n\u201CJust that your conversation with the king was not entirely fair.\u201D\r\n\u201COh?\u201D\r\n\u201CBecause of his, well, you know. His limited capacity. He did quite remarkably, but didn\u2019t make the arguments that someone more versed in Vorin theology might have.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd what arguments might such a one have made?\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, I\u2019m not very well trained in that area myself. But I do think that you ignored, or at least minimized, one vital part of the discussion.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhich is?\u201D\r\nShallan tapped at her breast. \u201COur hearts, Brightness. I believe because I feel something, a closeness to the Almighty, a peace that comes when I live my faith.\u201D\r\n\u201CThe mind is capable of projecting expected emotional responses.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut didn\u2019t you yourself argue that the way we act\u2014the way we feel about right and wrong\u2014was a defining attribute of our humanity? You used our innate morality to prove your point. So how can you discard my feelings?\u201D\r\n\u201CDiscard them? No. Regard them with skepticism? Perhaps. Your feelings, Shallan\u2014however powerful\u2014are your own. Not mine. And what I feel is that spending my life trying to earn the favor of an unseen, unknown, and unknowable being who watches me from the sky is an exercise in sheer futility.\u201D She pointed at Shallan with her pen. \u201CBut your rhetorical method is improving. We\u2019ll make a scholar of you yet.\u201D\r\nShallan smiled, feeling a surge of pleasure. Praise from Jasnah was more precious than an emerald broam.\r\nBut\u2026I\u2019m not going to be a scholar. I\u2019m going to steal the Soulcaster and leave.\r\nShe didn\u2019t like to think about that. That was something else she\u2019d have to get over; she tended to avoid thinking about things that made her uncomfortable.\r\n\u201CNow hurry and be about the king\u2019s sketch,\u201D Jasnah said, lifting a book. \u201CYou still have a great deal of real work to do once you are done drawing.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes, Brightness,\u201D Shallan said.\r\nFor once, however, she found sketching difficult, her mind too troubled to focus."

      "ChapterName": "30: DARKNESS UNSEEN",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\n\u201CThey were suddenly dangerous. Like a calm day that became a tempest.\u201D\r\n\u2014This fragment is the origin of a Thaylen proverb that was eventually reworked into a more common derivation. I believe it may reference the Voidbringers. See Ixsix\u2019s Emperor, fourth chapter.\r\nKaladin walked from the cavernous barrack into the pure light of first morning. Bits of quartz in the ground sparkled before him, catching the light, as if the ground were sparking and burning, ready to burst from within.\r\nA group of twenty-nine men followed him. Slaves. Thieves. Deserters. Foreigners. Even a few men whose only sin had been poverty. Those had joined the bridge crews out of desperation. The pay was good when compared with nothing, and they were promised that if they survived a hundred bridge runs, they would be promoted. Assignment to a watch post\u2014which, in the mind of a poor man, sounded like a life of luxury. Being paid to stand and look at things all day? What kind of insanity was that? It was like being rich, almost.\r\nThey didn\u2019t understand. Nobody survived a hundred bridge runs. Kaladin had been on two dozen, and he was already one of the most experienced living bridgemen.\r\nBridge Four followed him. The last of the holdouts\u2014a thin man named Bisig\u2014had given in yesterday. Kaladin preferred to think that the laughter, the food, and the humanity had finally gotten to him. But it had probably been a few glares or under-the-breath threats from Rock and Teft.\r\nKaladin turned a blind eye to those. He\u2019d eventually need the men\u2019s loyalty, but for now, he\u2019d settle for obedience.\r\nHe guided them through the morning exercises he\u2019d learned his very first day in the military. Stretches followed by jumping motions. Carpenters in brown work overalls and tan or green caps passed on their way to the lumberyard, shaking their heads in amusement. Soldiers on the short ridge above, where the camp proper began, looked down and laughed. Gaz watched from beside a nearby barrack, arms folded, single eye dissatisfied.\r\nKaladin wiped his brow. He met Gaz\u2019s eye for a long moment, then turned back to the men. There was still time to practice hauling the bridge before breakfast.\r\nGaz had never gotten used to having just one eye.\r\nCoulda man get used to that? He\u2019d rather have lost a hand or a leg than that eye. He couldn\u2019t stop feeling that\r\nsomethinghid in that darkness he couldn\u2019t see, but others could. What lurked there? Spren that would drain his soul from his body? The way a rat could empty an entire wineskin by chewing the corner?\r\nHis companions called him lucky. \u201CThat blow could have taken your life.\u201D Well, at least then he wouldn\u2019t have had to live with that darkness. One of his eyes was always closed. Close the other, and the darkness swallowed him.\r\nGaz glanced left, and the darkness scuttled to the side. Lamaril stood leaning against a post, tall and slim. He was not a massive man, but he was not weak. He was all lines. Rectangular beard. Rectangular body. Sharp. Like a knife.\r\nLamaril waved Gaz over, so he reluctantly approached. Then he took a sphere out of his pouch and passed it over. A topaz mark. He hated losing it. He always hated losing money.\r\n\u201CYou owe me twice as much as this,\u201D Lamaril noted, raising the sphere up to look through it as it sparkled in the sunlight.\r\n\u201CWell, that\u2019s all you\u2019ll get for now. Be glad you get anything.\u201D\r\n\u201CBe glad I\u2019ve kept my mouth shut,\u201D Lamaril said lazily, leaning back against his post. It was one that marked the edge of the lumberyard.\r\nGaz gritted his teeth. He hated to pay, but what else could he do?\r\nStorms take him. Raging storms take him!\r\n\u201CYou have a problem, it seems,\u201D Lamaril said.\r\nAt first, Gaz thought he meant the half payment. The lighteyed man nodded toward Bridge Four\u2019s barracks.\r\nGaz eyed the bridgemen, unsettled. The youthful bridgeleader barked an order, and the bridgemen raced the span of the lumberyard in a jog. He already had them running in time with one another. That one change meant so much. It sped them up, helped them think like a team.\r\nCould this boy actually have military training, as he\u2019d once claimed? Why would he be wasted as a bridgeman? Of course, there was that\r\nshashbrand on his forehead\u2026.\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t see a problem,\u201D Gaz said with a grunt. \u201CThey\u2019re fast. That\u2019s good.\u201D\r\n\u201CThey\u2019re insubordinate.\u201D\r\n\u201CThey follow orders.\u201D\r\n\u201C\r\nHisorders, perhaps.\u201D Lamaril shook his head. \u201CBridgemen exist for one purpose, Gaz. To protect the lives of more valuable men.\u201D\r\n\u201CReally? And here I thought their purpose was to carry bridges.\u201D\r\nLamaril gave him a sharp look. He leaned forward. \u201CDon\u2019t try me, Gaz. And don\u2019t forget your place. Would you like to join them?\u201D\r\nGaz felt a spike of fear. Lamaril was a very lowly lighteyes, one of the landless. But he\r\nwasGaz\u2019s immediate superior, a liaison between bridge crews and the higher-ranked lighteyes who oversaw the lumberyard.\r\nGaz looked down at the ground. \u201CI\u2019m sorry, Brightlord.\u201D\r\n\u201CHighprince Sadeas holds an edge,\u201D Lamaril said, leaning back against his post. \u201CHe maintains it by pushing us all. Hard. Each man in his place.\u201D He nodded toward the members of Bridge Four. \u201CSpeed is not a bad thing. Initiative is not a bad thing. But men with initiative like that boy\u2019s are not often happy in their position. The bridge crews function as they are, without need for modification. Change can be unsettling.\u201D\r\nGaz doubted that any of the bridgemen really understood their place in Sadeas\u2019s plans. If they knew why they were worked as pitilessly as they were\u2014and why they were forbidden shields or armor\u2014they likely would just cast themselves into the chasm. Bait. They were bait. Draw the Parshendi attention, let the savages think they were doing some good by felling a few bridges\u2019 worth of bridgemen every assault. So long as you took plenty of men, that didn\u2019t matter. Except to those who were slaughtered.\r\nStormfather, Gaz thought,\r\nI hate myself for being a part of this.But he\u2019d hated himself for a long time now. It wasn\u2019t anything new to him. \u201CI\u2019ll do something,\u201D he promised Lamaril. \u201CA knife in the night. Poison in the food.\u201D That twisted his insides. The boy\u2019s bribes were small, but they were all that let him keep ahead of his payments to Lamaril.\r\n\u201CNo!\u201D Lamaril hissed. \u201CYou want it seen that he was really a threat? The real soldiers are already talking about him.\u201D Lamaril grimaced. \u201CThe last thing we need is a martyr inspiring rebellion among the bridgemen. I don\u2019t want any\r\nhintof it; nothing our highprince\u2019s enemies could take advantage of.\u201D Lamaril glanced at Kaladin, jogging past again with his men. \u201CThat one has to fall on the field, as he deserves. Make certain it happens. And get me the rest of the money you owe, or you\u2019ll soon find yourself carrying one of those bridges yourself.\u201D\r\nHe swept away, forest-green cloak fluttering. In his time as a soldier, Gaz had learned to fear the minor lighteyes the most. They were galled by their closeness in rank to the darkeyes, yet those darkeyes were the only ones they had any authority over. That made them dangerous. Being around a man like Lamaril was like handling a hot coal with bare fingers. There was no way to avoid burning yourself. You just hoped to be quick enough to keep the burns to a minimum.\r\nBridge Four ran by. A month ago, Gaz wouldn\u2019t have believed this possible. A group of bridgemen,\r\npracticing? And all it seemed to have cost Kaladin was a few bribes of food and some empty promises that he would protect them.\r\nThat shouldn\u2019t have been enough. Life as a bridgeman was hopeless. Gaz\r\ncouldn\u2019tjoin them. He just couldn\u2019t. Kaladin the lordling had to fall. But if Kaladin\u2019s spheres vanished, Gaz could just as easily end up as a bridgeman for failing to pay Lamaril.\r\nStorming Damnation!he thought. It was like trying to choose which claw of the chasmfiend would crush you.\r\nGaz continued to watch Kaladin\u2019s crew. And\r\nstillthat darkness waited for him. Like an itch that couldn\u2019t be scratched. Like a scream that couldn\u2019t be silenced. A tingling numbness that he could never be rid of.\r\nIt would probably follow him even into death.\r\n\u201CBridge up!\u201D Kaladin bellowed, running with Bridge Four. They raised the bridge over their heads while still moving. It was harder to run this way, holding the bridge up, rather than resting it on the shoulders. He felt its enormous weight on his arms.\r\n\u201CDown!\u201D he ordered.\r\nThose at the front let go of the bridge and ran out to the sides. The others lowered the bridge in a quick motion. It hit the ground awkwardly, scraping the stone. They got into position, pretending to move it across a chasm. Kaladin helped at the side.\r\nWe\u2019ll need to practice on a real chasm,he thought as the men finished.\r\nI wonder what kind of bribe it would take for Gaz to let me do that.\r\nThe bridgemen, finished with their mock bridge run, looked toward Kaladin, exhausted but excited. He smiled at them. As a squadleader those months in Amaram\u2019s army, he\u2019d learned that praise should be honest, but it should never be withheld.\r\n\u201CWe need to work on that set-down,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CBut overall, I\u2019m impressed. Two weeks and you\u2019re already working together as well as some teams I trained for months. I\u2019m pleased. And proud. Go get something to drink and take a break. We\u2019ll do one or two more runs before work detail.\u201D\r\nIt was stone-gathering duty again, but that was nothing to complain about. He\u2019d convinced the men that lifting the stones would improve their strength, and had enlisted the few he trusted the most to help gather the knobweed, the means by which he continued to\u2014just barely\u2014keep the men supplied with extra food and build his stock of medical supplies.\r\nTwo weeks. An easy two weeks, as the lives of bridgemen went. Only two bridge runs, and on one they\u2019d gotten to the plateau too late. The Parshendi had escaped with the gemheart before they\u2019d even arrived. That was good for bridgemen.\r\nThe other assault hadn\u2019t been too bad, by bridgeman numbers. Two more dead: Amark and Koolf. Two more wounded: Narm and Peet. A fraction of what the other crews had lost, but still too many. Kaladin tried to keep his expression optimistic as he walked to the water barrel and took a ladle from one of the men, drinking it down.\r\nBridge Four would drown in its own wounded. They were only thirty strong, with five wounded who drew no pay and had to be fed out of the knobweed income. Counting those who\u2019d died, they\u2019d taken nearly thirty percent casualties in the weeks he\u2019d begun trying to protect them. In Amaram\u2019s army, that rate of casualties would have been catastrophic.\r\nBack then, Kaladin\u2019s life had been one of training and marching, punctuated by occasional frenzied bursts of battle. Here, the fighting was relentless. Every few days. That kind of thing could\u2014\r\nwould\u2014wear an army down.\r\nThere has to be a better way,Kaladin thought, swishing the lukewarm water in his mouth, then pouring another ladle on his head. He couldn\u2019t continue to lose two men a week to death and wounds. But how could they survive when their own officers didn\u2019t care if they lived or died?\r\nHe barely kept himself from throwing the ladle into the barrel in frustration. Instead, he handed it to Skar and gave him an encouraging smile. A lie. But an important one.\r\nGaz watched from the shadow of one of the other bridgeman barracks. Syl\u2019s translucent figure\u2014shaped now like floating knobweed fluff\u2014flitted around the bridge sergeant. Eventually, she made her way over to Kaladin, landing on his shoulder, taking her female form.\r\n\u201CHe\u2019s planning something,\u201D she said.\r\n\u201CHe hasn\u2019t interfered,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CHe hasn\u2019t even tried to stop us from having the nightly stew.\u201D\r\n\u201CHe was talking to that lighteyes.\u201D\r\n\u201CLamaril?\u201D\r\nShe nodded.\r\n\u201CLamaril\u2019s his superior,\u201D Kaladin said as he walked into the shade of Bridge Four\u2019s barrack. He leaned against the wall, looking over at his men by the water barrel. They talked to one another now. Joked. Laughed. They went out drinking together in the evenings. Stormfather, but he never thought he\u2019d be\r\ngladthat the men under his command went drinking.\r\n\u201CI didn\u2019t like their expressions,\u201D Syl said, sitting down on Kaladin\u2019s shoulder. \u201CDark. Like thunderclouds. I didn\u2019t hear what they were saying. I noticed them too late. But I don\u2019t like it, particularly that Lamaril.\u201D\r\nKaladin nodded slowly.\r\n\u201CYou don\u2019t trust him either?\u201D Syl asked.\r\n\u201CHe\u2019s a lighteyes.\u201D That was enough.\r\n\u201CSo we\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CSo we do nothing,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CI can\u2019t respond unless they try something. And if I spend all of my energy worrying about what they\r\nmightdo, I won\u2019t be able to solve the problems we\u2019re facing right now.\u201D\r\nWhat he didn\u2019t add was his real worry. If Gaz or Lamaril decided to have Kaladin killed, there was little he could to do to stop them. True, bridgemen were rarely executed for anything other than failing to run their bridge. But even in an \u201Chonest\u201D force like Amaram\u2019s, there had been rumors of trumped-up charges and fake evidence. In Sadeas\u2019s undisciplined, barely regulated camp, nobody would blink if Kaladin\u2014a\r\nshash-branded slave\u2014were strung up on some nebulous charge. They could leave him for the highstorm, washing their hands of his death, claiming that the Stormfather had chosen his fate.\r\nKaladin stood up straight and walked toward the carpentry section of the lumberyard. The craftsmen and their apprentices were hard at work cutting lengths of wood for spear hafts, bridges, posts, or furniture.\r\nThe craftsmen nodded to Kaladin as he passed. They were familiar with him now, used to his odd requests, like pieces of lumber long enough for four men to hold and run with to practice keeping cadence with one another. He found a half-finished bridge. It had eventually grown out of that one plank that Kaladin had used.\r\nKaladin knelt down, inspecting the wood. A group of men worked with a large saw just to his right, slicing thin rounds off a log. Those would probably become chair seats.\r\nHe ran his fingers along the smooth hardwood. All mobile bridges were made of a kind of wood called makam. It had a deep brown color, the grain almost hidden, and was both strong and light. The craftsmen had sanded this length smooth, and it smelled of sawdust and musky sap.\r\n\u201CKaladin?\u201D Syl asked, walking through the air then stepping onto the wood. \u201CYou look distant.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s ironic how well they craft these bridges,\u201D he said. \u201CThis army\u2019s carpenters are far more professional than its soldiers.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat makes sense,\u201D she said. \u201CThe craftsmen want to make bridges that last. The soldiers I listen to, they just want to get to the plateau, grab the gemheart, and get away. It\u2019s like a game to them.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s astute. You\u2019re getting better and better at observing us.\u201D\r\nShe grimaced. \u201CI feel more like I\u2019m remembering things I once knew.\u201D\r\n\u201CSoon you\u2019ll hardly be a spren at all. You\u2019ll be a little translucent philosopher. We\u2019ll have to send you off to a monastery to spend your time in deep, important thoughts.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D she said, \u201Clike how to best get the ardents there to accidentally drink a mixture that will turn his mouth blue.\u201D She smiled mischievously.\r\nKaladin smiled back, but kept running his finger across the wood. He still didn\u2019t understand why they wouldn\u2019t let bridgemen carry shields. Nobody would give him a straight answer on the question. \u201CThey use makam because it\u2019s strong enough for its weight to support a heavy cavalry charge,\u201D he said. \u201CWe should be able to use this. They deny us shields, but we already carry one on our shoulders.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut how would they react if you try that?\u201D\r\nKaladin stood. \u201CI don\u2019t know, but I also don\u2019t have any other choice.\u201D\r\nTrying this would be a risk. A huge risk. But he\u2019d run out of nonrisky ideas days ago.\r\n\u201CWe can hold it here,\u201D Kaladin said, pointing for Rock, Teft, Skar, and Moash. They stood beside a bridge turned up on its side, its underbelly exposed. The bottom was a complicated construction, with eight rows of three positions accommodating up to twenty-four men directly underneath, then sixteen sets of handles\u2014eight on each side\u2014for sixteen more men on the outside. Forty men, running shoulder to shoulder, if they had a full complement.\r\nEach position underneath the bridge had an indentation for the bridgeman\u2019s head, two curved blocks of wood to rest on his shoulders, and two rods for handholds. The bridgemen wore shoulder pads, and those who were shorter wore extras to compensate. Gaz generally tried to assign new bridgemen to crews based on their height.\r\nThat didn\u2019t hold for Bridge Four, of course. Bridge Four just got the leftovers.\r\nKaladin pointed to several rods and struts. \u201CWe could grab here, then run straight forward, carrying the bridge on its side to our right at a slant. We put our taller men on the outside and our shorter men on the inside.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat good would that do?\u201D Rock asked, frowning.\r\nKaladin glanced at Gaz, who was watching from nearby. Uncomfortably close. Best not to speak of why he really wanted to carry the bridge on its side. Besides, he didn\u2019t want to get the men\u2019s hopes up until he knew if it would work.\r\n\u201CI just want to experiment,\u201D he said. \u201CIf we can shift positions occasionally, it might be easier. Work different muscles.\u201D Syl frowned as she stood on the top of the bridge. She always frowned when Kaladin obscured the truth.\r\n\u201CGather the men,\u201D Kaladin said, waving to Rock, Teft, Skar, and Moash. He\u2019d named the four as his subsquad commanders, something that bridgemen didn\u2019t normally have. But soldiers worked best in smaller groups of six or eight.\r\nSoldiers,Kaladin thought.\r\nIs that how I think of them?\r\nThey didn\u2019t fight. But yes, they were soldiers. It was too easy to underestimate men when you considered them to be \u201Cjust\u201D bridgemen. Charging straight at enemy archers without shields took courage. Even when you were compelled to do it.\r\nHe glanced to the side, noticing that Moash hadn\u2019t left with the other three. The narrow-faced man had dark green eyes and brown hair flecked with black.\r\n\u201CSomething wrong, soldier?\u201D Kaladin asked.\r\nMoash blinked in surprise at the use of the word, but he and the others had grown to expect all kinds of unorthodoxy from Kaladin. \u201CWhy did you make me leader of a subsquad?\u201D\r\n\u201CBecause you resisted my leadership longer than almost any of the others. And you were flat-out more vocal about it than\r\nanyof them.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou made me a squad leader because I refused to obey you?\u201D\r\n\u201CI made you squad leader because you struck me as capable and intelligent. But beyond that, you weren\u2019t swayed too easily. You\u2019re strong-willed. I can use that.\u201D\r\nMoash scratched his chin, with its short beard. \u201CAll right then. But unlike Teft and that Horneater, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re a gift straight from the Almighty. I don\u2019t trust you.\u201D\r\n\u201CThen why obey me?\u201D\r\nMoash met his eyes, then shrugged. \u201CGuess I\u2019m curious.\u201D He moved off to gather his squad.\r\nWhat in the raging winds\u2026Gaz thought, dumbfounded as he watched Bridge Four charge past. What had possessed them to try carrying the bridge to the\r\nside?\r\nIt required them to clump up in an odd way, forming three rows instead of five, awkwardly clutching the underside of the bridge and holding it off to their right. It was one of the strangest things he\u2019d ever seen. They could barely all fit, and the handholds weren\u2019t made for carrying the bridge that way.\r\nGaz scratched his head as he watched them pass, then held out a hand, stopping Kaladin as he jogged by. The lordling let go of the bridge and hurried up to Gaz, wiping his brow as the others continued running. \u201CYes?\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat is that?\u201D Gaz said, pointing.\r\n\u201CBridge crew. Carrying what I believe is\u2026yes, it\u2019s a\r\nbridge.\u201D\r\n\u201CI didn\u2019t ask for lip,\u201D Gaz snarled. \u201CI want an explanation.\u201D\r\n\u201CCarrying the bridge over our heads gets tiring,\u201D Kaladin said. He was a tall man, tall enough to tower over Gaz.\r\nStorm it, I willnot\r\nbe intimidated!\u201CThis is a way to use different muscles. Like shifting a pack from one shoulder to the other.\u201D\r\nGaz glanced to the side. Had something moved in the darkness?\r\n\u201CGaz?\u201D Kaladin asked.\r\n\u201CLook, lordling,\u201D Gaz said, looking back to him. \u201CCarrying it overhead may be tiring, but carrying it like\r\nthatis just plain stupid. You look like you\u2019re about to stumble over one another, and the handholds are terrible. You can barely fit the men.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D Kaladin said more softly. \u201CBut a lot of the time, only half of a bridge crew will survive a bridge run. We can carry it back this way when there are fewer of us. It will let us shift positions, at least.\u201D\r\nGaz hesitated.\r\nOnly half a bridge crew\u2026\r\nIf they carried the bridge like that on an actual assault, they\u2019d go slowly, expose themselves. It could be a\r\ndisaster, for Bridge Four at least.\r\nGaz smiled. \u201CI like it.\u201D\r\nKaladin looked shocked. \u201C\r\nWhat?\u201D\r\n\u201CInitiative. Creativity. Yes, keep practicing. I\u2019d very much like to see you make a plateau approach carrying the bridge that way.\u201D\r\nKaladin narrowed his eyes. \u201CIs that so?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D Gaz said.\r\n\u201CWell then. Perhaps we will.\u201D\r\nGaz smiled, watching Kaladin retreat. A disaster was exactly what he needed. Now he just had to find some other way to pay Lamaril\u2019s blackmail."

      "ChapterName": "31: BENEATH THE SKIN",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\nSIX YEARS AGO\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t make the same mistake I did, son.\u201D\r\nKal looked up from his folio. His father sat on the other side of the operating room, one hand to his head, half-empty cup of wine in his other. Violet wine, among the strongest of liquors.\r\nLirin set the cup down, and the deep purple liquid\u2014the color of cremling blood\u2014shivered and trembled. It refracted Stormlight from a couple of spheres sitting on the counter.\r\n\u201CFather?\u201D\r\n\u201CWhen you get to Kharbranth, stay there.\u201D His voice was slurred. \u201CDon\u2019t get sucked back to this tiny, backward,\r\nfoolishtown. Don\u2019t force your beautiful wife to live away from everyone else she\u2019s ever known or loved.\u201D\r\nKal\u2019s father didn\u2019t often get drunk; this was a rare night of indulgence. Perhaps because Mother had gone to sleep early, exhausted from her work.\r\n\u201CYou\u2019ve always said I should come back,\u201D Kal said softly.\r\n\u201CI\u2019m an idiot.\u201D His back to Kal, he stared at the wall splashed with white light from the spheres. \u201CThey don\u2019t want me here. They never wanted me here.\u201D\r\nKal looked down at his folio. It contained drawings of dissected bodies, the muscles splayed and pulled out. The drawings were so detailed. Each had glyphpairs to designate every part, and he\u2019d committed those to memory. Now he studied the procedures, delving into the bodies of men long dead.\r\nOnce, Laral had told him that men weren\u2019t supposed to see beneath the skin. These folios, with their pictures, were part of what made everyone so mistrustful of Lirin. Seeing beneath was like seeing beneath the clothing, only worse.\r\nLirin poured himself more wine. How much the world could change in a short time. Kal pulled his coat close against the chill. A season of winter had come, but they couldn\u2019t afford charcoal for the brazier, for patients no longer gave offerings. Lirin hadn\u2019t stopped healing or surgery. The townspeople had simply stopped their donations, all at a word from Roshone.\r\n\u201CHe shouldn\u2019t be able to do this,\u201D Kal whispered.\r\n\u201CBut he can,\u201D Lirin said. He wore a white shirt and black vest atop tan trousers. The vest was unbuttoned, the front flaps hanging down by his sides, like the skin pulled back from the torsos of the men in Kal\u2019s drawings.\r\n\u201CWe could spend the spheres,\u201D Kal said hesitantly.\r\n\u201CThose are for your education,\u201D Lirin snapped. \u201CIf I could send you now, I would.\u201D\r\nKal\u2019s father and mother had sent a letter to the surgeons in Kharbranth, asking them to let Kal take the entry tests early. They\u2019d responded in the negative.\r\n\u201CHe wants us to spend them,\u201D Lirin said, words slurred. \u201CThat\u2019s why he said what he did. He\u2019s trying to bully us into needing those spheres.\u201D\r\nRoshone\u2019s words to the townspeople hadn\u2019t\r\nexactlybeen a command. He\u2019d just implied that if Kal\u2019s father was too foolish to charge, then he shouldn\u2019t be paid. The next day, people had stopped donating.\r\nThe townsfolk regarded Roshone with a confusing mixture of adoration and fear. In Kal\u2019s opinion, he didn\u2019t deserve either. Obviously, the man had been banished to Hearthstone because he was so bitter and flawed. He clearly didn\u2019t deserve to be among the\r\nreallighteyes, who fought for vengeance on the Shattered Plains.\r\n\u201CWhy do the people try so hard to please him?\u201D Kal asked of his father\u2019s back. \u201CThey never reacted this way around Brightlord Wistiow.\u201D\r\n\u201CThey do it because Roshone is unappeasable.\u201D\r\nKal frowned. Was that the wine talking?\r\nKal\u2019s father turned, his eyes reflecting pure Stormlight. In those eyes, Kal saw a surprising lucidity. He wasn\u2019t so drunk after all. \u201CBrightlord Wistiow let men do as they wished. And so they ignored him. Roshone lets them know he finds them contemptible. And so they scramble to please him.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat makes no sense,\u201D Kal said.\r\n\u201CIt is the way of things,\u201D Lirin said, playing with one of the spheres on the table, rolling it beneath his finger. \u201CYou\u2019ll have to learn this, Kal. When men perceive the world as being right, we are content. But if we see a hole\u2014a deficiency\u2014we scramble to fill it.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou make it sound noble, what they do.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt is in a way,\u201D Lirin said. He sighed. \u201CI shouldn\u2019t be so hard on our neighbors. They\u2019re petty, yes, but it\u2019s the pettiness of the ignorant. I\u2019m not disgusted by them. I\u2019m disgusted by the one who manipulates them. A man like Roshone can take what is honest and true in men and twist it into a mess of sludge to walk on.\u201D He took a sip, finishing the wine.\r\n\u201CWe should just spend the spheres,\u201D Kal said. \u201COr send them somewhere, to a moneylender or something. If they were gone, he\u2019d leave us alone.\u201D\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D Lirin said softly. \u201CRoshone is not the kind to spare a man once he is beaten. He\u2019s the type who keeps kicking. I don\u2019t know what political mistake landed him in this place, but he obviously can\u2019t get revenge on his rivals. So we\u2019re all he has.\u201D Lirin paused. \u201CPoor fool.\u201D\r\nPoor fool?Kal thought.\r\nHe\u2019s trying to destroy our lives, and that\u2019s all Father can say?\r\nWhat of the stories men sang at the hearths? Tales of clever herdsmen outwitting and overthrowing a foolish lighteyed man. There were dozens of variations, and Kal had heard them all. Shouldn\u2019t Lirin fight back somehow? Do something other than sit and wait?\r\nBut he didn\u2019t say anything; he knew exactly what Lirin would say.\r\nLet me worry about it. Get back to your studies.\r\nSighing, Kal settled back in his chair, opening his folio again. The surgery room was dim, lit by the four spheres on the table and a single one Kal used for reading. Lirin kept most of the spheres closed up in their cupboard, hidden away. Kal held up his own sphere, lighting the page. There were longer explanations of procedures in the back that his mother could read to him. She was the only woman in the town who could read, though Lirin said it wasn\u2019t uncommon among wellborn darkeyed women in the cities.\r\nAs he studied, Kal idly pulled something from his pocket. A rock that had been sitting on his chair for him when he\u2019d come in to study. He recognized it as a favorite one that Tien had been carrying around recently. Now he\u2019d left it for Kaladin; he often did that, hoping that his older brother would be able to see the beauty in it too, though they all just looked like ordinary rocks. He\u2019d have to ask Tien what he found so special about this particular one. There was always something.\r\nTien spent his days now learning carpentry from Ral, one of the men in the town. Lirin had set him to it reluctantly; he\u2019d been hoping for another surgery assistant, but Tien couldn\u2019t stand the sight of blood. He froze every time, and hadn\u2019t gotten used to it. That was troubling. Kal had hoped that his father would have Tien as an assistant when he left. And Kal\r\nwasleaving, one way or another. He hadn\u2019t decided between the army or Kharbranth, though in recent months, he\u2019d begun leaning toward becoming a spearman.\r\nIf he took that route, he\u2019d have to do it stealthily, once he was old enough that the recruiters would take him over his parents\u2019 objections. Fifteen would probably be old enough. Five more months. For now, he figured that knowing the muscles\u2014and vital parts of a body\u2014would be pretty useful for either a surgeon or a spearman.\r\nA thump came at the door. Kal jumped. It hadn\u2019t been a knock, but a\r\nthump. It came again. It sounded like something heavy pushing or slamming against the wood.\r\n\u201CWhat in the stormwinds?\u201D Lirin said, rising from his stool. He crossed the small room; his undone vest brushed the operating table, button scraping the wood.\r\nAnother thump. Kal scrambled out of his chair, closing the folio. At fourteen and a half, he was nearly as tall as his father now. A scraping came at the door, like nails or claws. Kal raised a hand toward his father, suddenly terrified. It was late at night, dark in the room, and the town was silent.\r\nThere was\r\nsomethingoutside. It sounded like a beast. Inhuman. A den of whitespines were said to be making trouble nearby, striking at travelers on the roadway. Kal had an image in his head of the reptilian creatures, as big as horses but with carapace across their backs. Was one of them sniffing at the door? Brushing it, trying to force its way in?\r\n\u201CFather!\u201D Kal yelped.\r\nLirin pulled open the door. The dim light of the spheres revealed not a monster, but a man wearing black clothing. He had a long metal bar in his hands, and he wore a black wool mask with holes cut for the eyes. Kal felt his heart race in panic as the would-be intruder leapt backward.\r\n\u201CDidn\u2019t expect to find anyone inside, did you?\u201D Kal\u2019s father said. \u201CIt\u2019s been years since there was a theft in the town. I\u2019m ashamed of you.\u201D\r\n\u201CGive us the spheres!\u201D a voice called out of the darkness. Another figure moved in the shadows, and then another.\r\nStormfather!Kal clutched the folio to his chest with trembling hands.\r\nHow many are there?Highwaymen, come to rob the town! Such things happened. More and more frequently these days, Kal\u2019s father said.\r\nHow could Lirin be so calm?\r\n\u201CThose spheres ain\u2019t yours,\u201D another voice called.\r\n\u201CIs that so?\u201D Kal\u2019s father said. \u201CDoes that make them yours? You think he\u2019d let you keep them?\u201D Kal\u2019s father spoke as if they weren\u2019t bandits from outside the town. Kal crept forward to stand just behind his father, frightened\u2014but at the same time ashamed of that fear. The men in the darkness were shadowy, nightmarish things, moving back and forth, faces of black.\r\n\u201CWe\u2019ll give them to him,\u201D one voice said.\r\n\u201CNo need for this to get violent, Lirin,\u201D another added. \u201CYou ain\u2019t going to spend them anyway.\u201D\r\nKal\u2019s father snorted. He ducked into the room. Kal cried out, moving back as Lirin threw open the cabinet where he kept the spheres. He grabbed the large glass goblet that he stored them in; it was covered with a black cloth.\r\n\u201CYou want them?\u201D Lirin called, walking to the doorway, passing Kal.\r\n\u201CFather?\u201D Kal said, panicked.\r\n\u201CYou want the light for yourself?\u201D Lirin\u2019s voice grew louder. \u201CHere!\u201D\r\nHe pulled the cloth free. The goblet exploded with fiery radiance, the brightness nearly blinding. Kal raised his arm. His father was a shadowed silhouette that seemed to hold the sun itself in its fingers.\r\nThe large goblet shone with a calm light. Almost a\r\ncoldlight. Kal blinked away tears, his eyes adjusting. He could see the men outside clearly now. Where dangerous shadows had once loomed, cringing men now raised hands. They didn\u2019t seem so intimidating; in fact, the cloths over their faces looked ridiculous.\r\nWhere Kal had been afraid, he now felt strangely confident. For a moment, it wasn\u2019t light his father held, but understanding itself.\r\nThat\u2019s Luten,Kal thought, noticing a man who limped. It was easy to distinguish him, despite the mask. Kal\u2019s father had operated on that leg; it was because of him that Luten could still walk. He recognized others too. Horl was the one with the wide shoulders, Balsas the man wearing the nice new coat.\r\nLirin didn\u2019t say anything to them at first. He stood with that light blazing, illuminating the entire stone square outside. The men seemed to shrink down, as if they knew he recognized them.\r\n\u201CWell?\u201D Lirin said. \u201CYou\u2019ve threatened violence against me. Come. Hit me. Rob me. Do it knowing I\u2019ve lived among you almost my entire life. Do it knowing that I\u2019ve healed your children. Come in. Bleed one of your own!\u201D\r\nThe men faded into the night without a word."

      "ChapterName": "32: SIDE CARRY",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\n\u201CThey lived high atop a place no man could reach, but all could visit. The tower city itself, crafted by the hands of no man.\u201D\r\n\u2014Though\r\nThe Song of the Last Summeris a fanciful tale of romance from the third century after the Recreance, it is likely a valid reference in this case. See page 27 of Varala\u2019s translation, and note the undertext.\r\nThey got better at carrying the bridge on its side. But not much better. Kaladin watched Bridge Four pass, moving awkwardly, maneuvering the bridge at their sides. Fortunately, there were plenty of handles on the bridge\u2019s underside, and they\u2019d found how to grip them in the right way. They had to carry it at less steep an angle than he\u2019d wanted. That would expose their legs, but may be he could train them to adjust to it as the arrows flew.\r\nAs it was, their carry was slow, and the bridgemen were so bunched up that if the Parshendi managed to drop a man, the others would stumble over him. Lose just a few men, and the balance would be upset so they\u2019d drop it for certain.\r\nThis will have to be handled very carefully,Kaladin thought.\r\nSyl fluttered along behind the bridge crew as a flurry of nearly translucent leaves. Beyond her, something caught Kaladin\u2019s eye: a uniformed soldier leading a ragged group of men in a despondent clump.\r\nFinally,Kaladin thought. He\u2019d been waiting for another group of recruits. He waved curtly to Rock. The Horneater nodded; he\u2019d take over training. It was time for a break anyway.\r\nKaladin jogged up the short incline at the rim of the lumberyard, arriving just as Gaz intercepted the newcomers.\r\n\u201CWhat a sorry batch,\u201D Gaz said. \u201CI thought we\u2019d been sent the dregs last time, but this lot\u2026\u201D\r\nLamaril shrugged. \u201CThey\u2019re yours now, Gaz. Split them up how you like.\u201D He and his soldiers departed, leaving the unfortunate conscripts. Some wore decent clothing; they\u2019d be recently caught criminals. The rest had slave brands on their foreheads. Seeing them brought back feelings that Kaladin had to force down. He still stood on the very top of a steep slope; one wrong step could send him tumbling back down into that despair.\r\n\u201CIn a line, you cremlings,\u201D Gaz snapped at the new recruits, pulling free his cudgel and waving it. He eyed Kaladin, but said nothing.\r\nThe group of men hastily lined up.\r\nGaz counted down the line, picking out the taller members. \u201CYou five men, you\u2019re in Bridge Six. Remember that. Forget it, and I\u2019ll see you get a whipping.\u201D He counted off another group. \u201CYou six men, you\u2019re in Bridge Fourteen. You four at the end, Bridge Three. You, you, and you, Bridge One. Bridge Two doesn\u2019t need any\u2026You four, Bridge Seven.\u201D\r\nThat was all of them.\r\n\u201CGaz,\u201D Kaladin said, folding his arms. Syl landed on his shoulder, her small tempest of leaves forming into a young woman.\r\nGaz turned to him.\r\n\u201CBridge Four is down to thirty fighting members.\u201D\r\n\u201CBridge Six and Bridge Fourteen have fewer than that.\u201D\r\n\u201CThey each had twenty-nine and you just gave them both a big helping of new members. And Bridge One is at thirty-seven, and you sent\r\nthemthree new men.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou barely lost anyone on the last run, and\u2014\u201D\r\nKaladin caught Gaz\u2019s arm as the sergeant tried to walk away. Gaz flinched, lifting his cudgel.\r\nTry it,Kaladin thought, meeting Gaz\u2019s eyes. He almost wished that the sergeant would.\r\nGaz gritted his teeth. \u201CFine. One man.\u201D\r\n\u201CI pick him,\u201D Kaladin said.\r\n\u201CWhatever. They\u2019re all worthless anyway.\u201D\r\nKaladin turned to the group of new bridgemen. They\u2019d gathered into clusters by which bridge crew Gaz had put them in. Kaladin immediately turned his attention to the taller men. By slave standards, they appeared well fed. Two of them looked like they\u2019d\u2014\r\n\u201CHey, gancho!\u201D a voice said from another group. \u201CHey! You want me, I think.\u201D\r\nKaladin turned. A short, spindly man was waving to him. The man had only one arm. Who would assign him to be a bridgeman?\r\nHe\u2019d stop an arrow,Kaladin thought.\r\nThat\u2019s all some bridgemen are good for, in the eyes of the uppers.\r\nThe man had brown hair and deep tan skin just a shade too dark to be Alethi. The fingernails on his hand were slate-colored and crystalline\u2014he was a Herdazian, then. Most of the newcomers shared the same defeated look of apathy but this man was\r\nsmiling, though he wore a slave\u2019s mark on his head.\r\nThat mark is old,Kaladin thought.\r\nEither he had a kind master before this, or he has somehow resisted being beaten down.The man obviously didn\u2019t understand what awaited him as a bridgeman. No person would smile if they understood that.\r\n\u201CYou can use me,\u201D the man said. \u201CWe Herdazians are great fighters, gon.\u201D He pronounced that last word like \u201Cgone\u201D and it appeared to refer to Kaladin. \u201CYou see, this one time, I was with, sure, three men and they were drunk and all but I still beat them.\u201D He spoke at a very quick pace, his thick accent slurring the words together.\r\nHe\u2019d make a terrible bridgeman. He\r\nmightbe able to run with the bridge on his shoulders, but not maneuver it. He even looked a little flabby around the waist. Whatever bridge crew got him would put him right in the front and let him take an arrow, then be rid of him.\r\nGotta do what you can to stay alive,a voice from his past seemed to whisper.\r\nTurn a liability into an advantage\u2026.\r\nTien.\r\n\u201CVery well,\u201D Kaladin said, pointing. \u201CI\u2019ll take the Herdazian at the back.\u201D\r\n\u201C\r\nWhat?\u201D Gaz said.\r\nThe short man sauntered up to Kaladin. \u201CThanks, gancho! You\u2019ll be glad you picked me.\u201D\r\nKaladin turned to walk back, passing Gaz. The bridge sergeant scratched his head. \u201CYou pushed me that hard so you could pick the one-armed runt?\u201D\r\nKaladin walked on without a word for Gaz. Instead, he turned to the one-armed Herdazian. \u201CWhy did you want to come with me? You don\u2019t know anything about the different bridge crews.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou were only picking one,\u201D the man said. \u201CThat means one man gets to be special, the others don\u2019t. I\u2019ve got a good feeling about you. It\u2019s in your eyes, gancho.\u201D He paused. \u201CWhat\u2019s a bridge crew?\u201D\r\nKaladin found himself smiling at the man\u2019s nonchalant attitude. \u201CYou\u2019ll see. What\u2019s your name?\u201D\r\n\u201CLopen,\u201D the man said. \u201CSome of my cousins, they call me\r\ntheLopen because they haven\u2019t ever heard anyone else named that. I\u2019ve asked around a lot, maybe one hundred\u2026or two hundred\u2026lots of people, sure. And nobody has heard of that name.\u201D\r\nKaladin blinked at the torrent of words. Did the man ever stop to breathe?\r\nBridge Four was taking their break, their massive bridge resting on one side and giving shade. The five wounded had joined them and were chatting; even Leyten was up, which was encouraging. He\u2019d been having a lot of trouble walking, what with that crushed leg. Kaladin had done what he could, but the man would always have a limp.\r\nThe only one who didn\u2019t talk to the others was Dabbid, the man who had been so profoundly shocked by battle. He followed the others, but he didn\u2019t talk. Kaladin was starting to fear that the man would never recover from his mind fatigue.\r\nHobber\u2014the round-faced, gap-toothed man who had taken an arrow to the leg\u2014was walking without a crutch. It wouldn\u2019t be long before he could start running bridges again, and a good thing, too. They needed every pair of hands they could get.\r\n\u201CHead to the barrack there,\u201D Kaladin said to Lopen. \u201CThere\u2019s a blanket, sandals, and vest for you in the pile at the very back.\u201D\r\n\u201CSure,\u201D Lopen said, sauntering off. He waved at a few of the men as he passed.\r\nRock walked up to Kaladin, folding his arms. \u201CIs new member?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D Kaladin said.\r\n\u201CThe only kind Gaz would give us, I assume.\u201D Rock sighed. \u201CThis thing, we should have expected it. He will give us only the very most useless of bridgemen from now on.\u201D\r\nKaladin was tempted to say something in the way of agreement, but hesitated. Syl would probably see it as a lie, and that would annoy her.\r\n\u201CThis new way of carrying the bridge,\u201D Rock said. \u201CIs not very useful, I think. Is\u2014\u201D\r\nHe cut off as a horn call blared over the camp, echoing against stone buildings like the bleat of a distant greatshell. Kaladin grew tense. His men were on duty. He waited, tense, until the third set of horns blew.\r\n\u201CLine up!\u201D Kaladin yelled. \u201CLet\u2019s move!\u201D\r\nUnlike the other nineteen crews on duty, Kaladin\u2019s men didn\u2019t scramble about in confusion, but assembled in an orderly fashion. Lopen dashed out, wearing a vest, then hesitated, looking at the four squads, not knowing where to go. He\u2019d be cut to ribbons if Kaladin put him in front, but he\u2019d probably just slow them down anywhere else.\r\n\u201CLopen!\u201D Kaladin shouted.\r\nThe one-armed man saluted.\r\nDoes he think he\u2019s actually in the military?\r\n\u201CYou see that rain barrel? Go get some waterskins from the carpenter\u2019s assistants. They told me we could borrow some. Fill as many as you can, then catch up down below.\u201D\r\n\u201CSure, gancho,\u201D Lopen said.\r\n\u201CBridge up!\u201D Kaladin shouted, moving into position at the front. \u201CShoulder carry!\u201D\r\nBridge Four moved. While some of the other bridge crews were crowded around their barracks, Kaladin\u2019s team charged across the lumberyard. They were first down the incline, and reached the first permanent bridge before the army even formed up. There, Kaladin ordered them to put their bridge down and wait.\r\nShortly thereafter, Lopen trotted down the hillside\u2014and, surprisingly, Dabbid and Hobber were with him. They couldn\u2019t move fast, not with Hobber\u2019s limp, but they had constructed a sort of litter with a tarp and two lengths of wood. Piled into the middle of it were a good twenty waterskins. They trotted up to the bridge team.\r\n\u201CWhat\u2019s this?\u201D Kaladin said.\r\n\u201CYou told me to bring whatever I could carry, gon,\u201D Lopen said. \u201CWell, we got this thing from the carpenters. They use it to carry pieces of wood, they said, and they weren\u2019t using it so we took it and now we\u2019re here. Ain\u2019t that right, moolie?\u201D He said that last to Dabbid, who just nodded.\r\n\u201CMoolie?\u201D Kaladin asked.\r\n\u201CMeans mute,\u201D Lopen said, shrugging. \u201C\u2019Cuz he doesn\u2019t seem to talk much, you see.\u201D\r\n\u201CI see. Well, good job. Bridge Four, back in position. Here comes the rest of the army.\u201D\r\nThe next few hours were what they had grown to expect from bridge runs. Grueling conditions, carrying the heavy bridge across plateaus. The water proved a huge help. The army occasionally watered the bridgemen during runs, but never as often as the men needed it. Being able to take a drink after crossing each plateau was as good as having a half-dozen more men.\r\nBut the real difference came from the practice. Bridge Four\u2019s men no longer fell exhausted each time they set a bridge down. The work was still difficult, but their bodies were ready for it. Kaladin caught more than a few glances of surprise or envy from the other bridge crews as his men laughed and joked instead of collapsing. Running a bridge once a week or so\u2014as the other men did\u2014just wasn\u2019t enough. An extra meal each night combined with training had built up his men\u2019s muscles and prepared them to work.\r\nThe march was a long one, as long as Kaladin had ever made. They traveled eastward for hours. That was a bad sign. When they aimed for closer plateaus, they often got there before the Parshendi. But this far out they were racing just to prevent the Parshendi from escaping with the gemheart; there was no chance they\u2019d arrive before the enemy.\r\nThat meant it would probably be a difficult approach.\r\nWe\u2019re not ready for the side carry,Kaladin thought nervously, as they finally drew close to an enormous plateau rising in an unusual shape. He\u2019d heard of it\u2014the Tower, it was called. No Alethi force had ever won a gemheart here.\r\nThey set their bridge down before the penultimate chasm, positioning it, and Kaladin felt a foreboding as the scouts crossed. The Tower was wedge-shaped, uneven, with the southeastern point rising far into the air, creating a steep hillside. Sadeas had brought a large number of soldiers; this plateau was enormous, allowing the deployment of a larger force. Kaladin waited, anxious. Maybe they\u2019d be lucky, and the Parshendi would already be gone with the gemheart. It was possible, this far out.\r\nThe scouts came charging back. \u201CEnemy lines on the opposing rim! They haven\u2019t gotten the chrysalis open yet!\u201D\r\nKaladin groaned softly. The army began to cross on his bridge, and Bridge Four regarded him, solemn, expressions grim. They knew what would come next. Some of them, perhaps many of them, would not survive.\r\nIt was going to be very bad this time. On previous runs, they\u2019d had a buffer. When they\u2019d lost four or five men, they\u2019d still been able to keep going. Now they were running with just thirty members. Every man they lost would slow them measurably, and the loss of just four or five more would cause them to wobble, or even topple. When that happened, the Parshendi would focus everything on them. He\u2019d seen it happen before. If a bridge crew started to teeter, the Parshendi pounced.\r\nBesides, when a bridge crew was visibly low on numbers, it always got targeted by the Parshendi to be taken down. Bridge Four was in trouble. This run could easily end with fifteen or twenty deaths. Something had to be done.\r\nThis was it.\r\n\u201CGather close,\u201D Kaladin said.\r\nThe men frowned, stepping up to him.\r\n\u201CWe\u2019re going to carry the bridge in side position,\u201D Kaladin said softly. \u201CI\u2019ll go first. I\u2019m going to steer; be ready to go in the direction I do.\u201D\r\n\u201CKaladin,\u201D Teft said, \u201Cside position is slow. It was an interesting idea, but\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CDo you trust me, Teft?\u201D Kaladin asked.\r\n\u201CWell, I guess.\u201D The grizzled man glanced at the others. Kaladin could see that many of them did not, at least not fully.\r\n\u201CThis will work,\u201D Kaladin said intently. \u201CWe\u2019re going to use the bridge as a shield to block arrows. We need to hurry out in front, faster than the other bridges. It\u2019ll be hard to outrun them with the side carry, but it\u2019s the only thing I can think of. If it doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019ll be in front, so I\u2019ll be the first to drop. If I die, move the bridge to shoulder-carry. We\u2019ve practiced doing that. Then you\u2019ll be rid of me.\u201D\r\nThe bridgemen were silent.\r\n\u201CWhat if we don\u2019t want to be rid of you?\u201D long-faced Natam asked.\r\nKaladin smiled. \u201CThen run swiftly and follow my lead. I\u2019m going to turn us unexpectedly during the run; be ready to change directions.\u201D\r\nHe went back to the bridge. The common soldiers were across, and the lighteyes\u2014including Sadeas in his ornate Shardplate\u2014were riding over the span. Kaladin and Bridge Four followed, then pulled the bridge behind them. They shoulder-carried it to the front of the army and put it down, waiting for the other bridges to get in place. Lopen and the other two water-carriers hung back with Gaz; it looked like they wouldn\u2019t get into trouble for not running. That was a small blessing.\r\nKaladin felt sweat bead on his forehead. He could just barely make out the Parshendi ranks ahead, on the other side of the chasm. Men of black and crimson, shortbows held at the ready, arrows nocked. The enormous slope of the Tower rose behind them.\r\nKaladin\u2019s heart beat faster. Anticipationspren sprung up around members of the army, but not his team. To their credit, there weren\u2019t any fearspren either\u2014not that they didn\u2019t feel fear, they just weren\u2019t as panicked as the other bridge crews, so the fearspren went there instead.\r\nCare,Tukks seemed to whisper at him from the past.\r\nThe key to fighting isn\u2019t lack of passion, it\u2019s controlled passion. Care about winning. Care about those you defend. Youhave\r\nto care about something.\r\nI care,Kaladin thought.\r\nStorm me as a fool, but I do.\r\n\u201CBridges up!\u201D Gaz\u2019s voice echoed across the front lines, repeating the order given him by Lamaril.\r\nBridge Four moved, quickly turning the bridge on its side and hoisting it up. The shorter men made a line, holding the bridge up to their right, with the taller men forming a bunched-up line behind them, reaching through and lifting or reaching high and steadying the bridge. Lamaril gave them a harsh look, and Kaladin\u2019s breath caught in his throat.\r\nGaz stepped up and whispered something to Lamaril. The nobleman nodded slowly, and said nothing. The assault call sounded.\r\nBridge Four charged.\r\nFrom behind them, arrows flew in a wave over the bridge crews\u2019 heads, arcing down toward the Parshendi. Kaladin ran, jaw clenched. He had trouble keeping himself from stumbling over the rockbuds and shalebark growths. Fortunately, though his team was slower than normal, their practice and endurance meant they were still faster than the other crews. With Kaladin at their lead, Bridge Four managed to get out ahead of the others.\r\nThat was important, because Kaladin angled his team slightly to the right, as if his crew were just a tad off-course with the heavy bridge at the side. The Parshendi knelt down and began to chant together. Alethi arrows fell among them, distracting some, but the others raised bows.\r\nGet ready\u2026Kaladin thought. He pushed harder, and felt a sudden surge of strength. His legs stopped straining, his breath stopped wheezing. Perhaps it was the anxiety of battle, perhaps it was numbness setting in, but the unexpected strength gave him a slight sense of euphoria. He felt as if something were buzzing within him, mixing with his blood.\r\nIn that moment it felt like he was\r\npullingthe bridge behind him all alone, like a sail towing the ship beneath it. He turned farther to the right, running at a deeper angle, putting himself and his men in full sight of the Parshendi archers.\r\nThe Parshendi continued to chant, somehow knowing\u2014without orders\u2014when to draw their bows. They pulled arrows to marbled cheeks, sighting on the bridgemen. As expected, many aimed at his men.\r\nAlmost close enough!\r\nJust a few heartbeats more\u2026\r\nNow!\r\nKaladin turned sharply to the left just as the Parshendi loosed. The bridge moved with him, now charging with the face of the bridge pointed toward the archers. Arrows flew, snapping against the wood, digging into it. Some arrows rattled against the stone beneath their feet. The bridge resounded with the impacts.\r\nKaladin heard desperate screams of pain from the other bridge crews. Men fell, some of them probably on their first run. In Bridge Four, nobody cried out. Nobody fell.\r\nKaladin turned the bridge again, running angled in the other direction, the bridgemen exposed again. The surprised Parshendi nocked arrows. Normally, they fired in waves. That gave Kaladin an opportunity, for as soon as the Parshendi got the arrows drawn, he turned, using the bulky bridge as a shield.\r\nAgain, arrows snapped into the wood. Again, other bridge crews screamed. Again, Kaladin\u2019s zigzagging run protected his men.\r\nOne more,Kaladin thought. This would be the tough one. The Parshendi would know what he was doing. They\u2019d be ready to fire once he turned back.\r\nHe turned.\r\nNobody fired.\r\nAmazed, he realized that the Parshendi archers had turned all of their attention to the other bridge crews, seeking easier targets. The space in front of Bridge Four was virtually empty.\r\nThe chasm was near, and\u2014despite his angling\u2014Kaladin brought his team in on-mark to place their bridge in the right spot. They all had to be aligned close together for cavalry charge to work. Kaladin quickly gave the order to drop. Some of the Parshendi archers turned their attention back, but most ignored them, firing their arrows at the other crews.\r\nA crash from behind announced a bridge falling. Kaladin and his men pushed, the Alethi archers behind pelting the Parshendi to distract them and keep them from shoving the bridge back. Still pushing, Kaladin risked a glance over his shoulder.\r\nThe next bridge in line was close. It was Bridge Seven, but they were floundering, arrow after arrow striking them, cutting them down in rows. They fell as he watched, bridge crashing to the stones. Now Bridge Twenty-seven was wavering. Two other bridges were already down. Bridge Six had reached the chasm, but just barely, over half its members down. Where were the other bridge crews? He couldn\u2019t tell from his quick glance, and had to turn back to his work.\r\nKaladin\u2019s men placed their bridge with a thump, and Kaladin gave the call to pull back. He and his men dashed away to let the cavalry charge across. But no cavalry came. Sweat dripping from his brow, Kaladin spun.\r\nFive other bridge crews had set their bridges, but others were still struggling to reach the chasm. Unexpectedly, they\u2019d tried tilting their bridges to block the arrows, emulating Kaladin and his team. Many stumbled, some men attempting to lower the bridge for protection while others still ran forward.\r\nIt was chaos. These men hadn\u2019t practiced the side carry. As one straggling crew tried to hold their bridge up in the new position, they dropped it. Two more bridge crews were cut down completely by the Parshendi, who continued to fire.\r\nHeavy cavalry charged, crossing the six bridges that had been set. Normally, two riders abreast on each bridge added up to a mass of a hundred horsemen, thirty to forty across and three ranks deep. That depended on many bridges aligned in a row, allowing an effective charge against the hundreds of Parshendi archers.\r\nBut the bridges had been set too erratically. Some cavalry got across, but they were scattered, and couldn\u2019t ride down the Parshendi without fear of being surrounded.\r\nFoot soldiers had started to help push Bridge Six into place.\r\nWe should go help,Kaladin realized.\r\nGet those other bridges across.\r\nBut it was too late. Though Kaladin stood near the battlefield, his men\u2014as was their practice\u2014had fallen back to the nearest rock outcropping for shelter. The one they\u2019d chosen was close enough to see the battle, but was well protected from arrows. The Parshendi always ignored bridgemen after the initial assault, though the Alethi were careful to leave rear guards to protect the landing point and watch for Parshendi trying to cut off their retreat.\r\nThe soldiers finally maneuvered Bridge Six into place, and two more bridge crews got theirs down, but half of the bridges hadn\u2019t made it. The army had to reorganize on the run, dashing forward to support the cavalry, splitting to cross where the bridges had been set.\r\nTeft left the outcropping and grabbed Kaladin by the arm, tugging him back to relative safety. Kaladin allowed himself to be pulled along, but he still looked at the battlefield, a horrible realization coming to him.\r\nRock stepped up beside Kaladin, clapping him on the shoulder. The large Horneater\u2019s hair was plastered to his head with sweat, but he was smiling broadly. \u201CIs miracle! Not a single man wounded!\u201D\r\nMoash stepped up beside them. \u201CStormfather! I can\u2019t believe what we just did. Kaladin, you\u2019ve changed bridge runs forever!\u201D\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D Kaladin said softly. \u201CI\u2019ve completely undermined our assault.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2014What?\u201D\r\nStormfather!Kaladin thought. The heavy cavalry had been cut off. A cavalry charge needed an unbroken line; it was the intimidation as much as anything that made it work.\r\nBut here, the Parshendi could dodge out of the way, then come at the horsemen from the flanks. And the foot soldiers hadn\u2019t gotten in quickly enough to help. Several groups of horsemen fought completely surrounded. Soldiers bunched up around the bridges that had been set, trying to get across, but the Parshendi had a solid foothold and were repelling them. Spearmen fell from the bridges, and the Parshendi then managed to topple one entire bridge into the chasm. The Alethi forces were soon on the defensive, the soldiers focused on holding the bridgeheads to secure an avenue of retreat for the cavalry.\r\nKaladin watched, really\r\nwatched. He\u2019d never studied the tactics and needs of the entire army in these assaults. He\u2019d considered only the needs of his own crew. It was a foolish mistake, and he should have known better. He\r\nwouldhave known better, if he\u2019d still thought of himself as a real soldier. He hated Sadeas; he hated the way the man used bridge crews. But he shouldn\u2019t have changed Bridge Four\u2019s basic tactics without considering the larger scheme of the battle.\r\nI deflected attention to the other bridge crews,Kaladin thought.\r\nThat got us to the chasm too soon, and slowed some of the others.\r\nAnd, since he\u2019d run out in front, many other bridgemen had gotten a good view of how he\u2019d used the bridge as a shield. That had led them to emulate Bridge Four. Each of the crews had ended up running at a different speed, and the Alethi archers hadn\u2019t known where to focus their volleys to soften the Parshendi for the bridge landings.\r\nStormfather! I\u2019ve just cost Sadeas this battle.\r\nThere would be repercussions. The bridgemen had been forgotten while the generals and captains scrambled to revise their battle plans. But once this was over, they would come for him.\r\nOr maybe it would happen sooner. Gaz and Lamaril, with a group of reserve spearmen, were marching toward Bridge Four.\r\nRock stepped up beside Kaladin on one side, a nervous Teft on the other, holding a stone in his hands. The bridgemen behind Kaladin began to mutter.\r\n\u201CStand down,\u201D Kaladin said softly to Rock and Teft.\r\n\u201CBut, Kaladin!\u201D Teft said. \u201CThey\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CStand down. Gather the bridgemen. Get them back to the lumberyard safely, if you can.\u201D\r\nIf any of us escape this disaster.\r\nWhen Rock and Teft didn\u2019t back away, Kaladin stepped forward. The battle still raged on the Tower; Sadeas\u2019s group\u2014led by the Shardbearer himself\u2014had managed to claim a small section of ground and were holding it doggedly. Corpses piled up on both sides. It wouldn\u2019t be enough.\r\nRock and Teft moved up beside Kaladin again, but he stared them down, forcing them back. Then he turned to Gaz and Lamaril.\r\nI\u2019ll point out that Gaz told me to do this,he thought.\r\nHe suggested I use a side carry on a bridge assault.\r\nBut no. There were no witnesses. It would be his word against Gaz\u2019s. That wouldn\u2019t work\u2014plus, that argument would leave Gaz and Lamaril with good reason to see Kaladin dead immediately, before he could speak to their superiors.\r\nKaladin needed to do something else.\r\n\u201CDo you have any idea what you\u2019ve done?\u201D Gaz sputtered as he grew near.\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve upended the army\u2019s strategy,\u201D Kaladin said, \u201Cthrowing the entire assault force into chaos. You\u2019ve come to punish me so that when your superiors come screaming to you for what happened, you can at least show that you acted quickly to deal with the one responsible.\u201D\r\nGaz paused, Lamaril and the spearmen stopping around him. The bridge sergeant looked surprised.\r\n\u201CIf it\u2019s worth anything,\u201D Kaladin said grimly, \u201CI didn\u2019t know this would happen. I was just trying to survive.\u201D\r\n\u201CBridgemen aren\u2019t\r\nsupposedto survive,\u201D Lamaril said curtly. He waved to a pair of his soldiers, then pointed at Kaladin.\r\n\u201CIf you leave me alive,\u201D Kaladin said, \u201CI promise I will tell your superiors that you had nothing to do with this. If you kill me, it will look like you were trying to hide something.\u201D\r\n\u201CHide something?\u201D Gaz said, glancing at the battle on the Tower. A stray arrow clattered across the rocks a short distance from him, shaft breaking. \u201CWhat would we have to hide?\u201D\r\n\u201CDepends. This very well\r\ncouldlook like it was your idea from the start. Brightlord Lamaril, you didn\u2019t stop me. You could have, but you didn\u2019t, and soldiers saw Gaz and you speaking when you saw what I did. If I can\u2019t vouch for your ignorance of what I was going to do, then you\u2019ll look very, very bad.\u201D\r\nLamaril\u2019s soldiers looked to their leader. The lighteyed man scowled. \u201CBeat him,\u201D he said, \u201Cbut don\u2019t kill him.\u201D He turned and marched back toward the Alethi reserve lines.\r\nThe beefy spearmen walked up to Kaladin. They were darkeyed, but they might as well have been Parshendi for all the sympathy they would show him. Kaladin closed his eyes and steeled himself. He couldn\u2019t fight them all off. Not and remain with Bridge Four.\r\nA spear butt to the gut knocked him to the ground, and he gasped as the soldiers began to kick. One booted foot tore open his belt pouch. His spheres\u2014too precious to leave in the barrack\u2014scattered across the stones. They had somehow lost their Stormlight, and were now dun, their life run out.\r\nThe soldiers kept kicking."

      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\n\u201CThey changed, even as we fought them. Like shadows they were, that can transform as the flame dances. Never underestimate them because of what you first see.\u201D\r\n\u2014Purports to be a scrap collected from Talatin, a Radiant of the Order of Stonewards. The source\u2014Guvlow\u2019s\r\nIncarnate\u2014is generally held as reliable, though this is from a copied fragment of \u201CThe Poem of the Seventh Morning,\u201D which has been lost.\r\nSometimes, when Shallan walked into the Palanaeum proper\u2014the grand storehouse of books, manuscripts, and scrolls beyond the study areas of the Veil\u2014she grew so distracted by the beauty and scope of it that she forgot everything else.\r\nThe Palanaeum was shaped like an inverted pyramid carved down into the rock. It had balcony walkways suspended around its perimeter. Slanted gently downward, they ran around all four walls to form a majestic square spiral, a giant staircase pointing toward the center of Roshar. A series of lifts provided a quicker method of descending.\r\nStanding at the top level\u2019s railing, Shallan could see only halfway to the bottom. This place seemed too large, too grand, to have been shaped by the hands of men. How had the terraced levels been aligned so perfectly? Had Soulcasters been used to create the open spaces? How many gemstones would that have taken?\r\nThe lighting was dim; there was no general illumination, only small emerald lamps focused to illuminate the walkway floors. Ardents from the Devotary of Insight periodically moved through the levels, changing the spheres. There had to be hundreds upon hundreds of the emeralds here; apparently, they made up the Kharbranthian royal treasury. What better place for them than the extremely secure Palanaeum? Here they could both be protected and serve to illuminate the enormous library.\r\nShallan continued on her way. Her parshman servant carried a sphere lantern containing a trio of sapphire marks. The soft blue light reflected against the stone walls, portions of which had been Soulcast into quartz purely for ornamentation. The railings had been carved from wood, then transformed to marble. When she ran her fingers across one, she could feel the original wood\u2019s grain. At the same time, it had the cold smoothness of stone. An oddity that seemed designed to confuse the senses.\r\nHer parshman carried a small basket of books full of drawings by famous natural scientists. Jasnah had begun allowing Shallan to spend some of her study time on topics of her own choosing. Just a single hour a day, but it was remarkable how precious that hour had become. Recently, she\u2019d been digging through Myalmr\u2019s\r\nWestern Voyages.\r\nThe world was a wondrous place. She hungered to learn more, wished to observe each and every one of its creatures, to have sketches of them in her books. To organize Roshar by capturing it in images. The books she read, though wonderful, all felt incomplete. Each author would be good with words or with drawings, but rarely both. And if the author\r\nwasgood with both, then her grasp of science would be poor.\r\nThere were so many holes in their understanding. Holes that Shallan could fill.\r\nNo,she told herself firmly as she walked.\r\nThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m here to do.\r\nIt was getting harder and harder to stay focused on the theft, though Jasnah\u2014as Shallan had hoped\u2014had begun using her as a bathing attendant. That might soon present the opportunity she needed. And yet, the more she studied, the more she hungered for knowledge.\r\nShe led her parshman to one of the lifts. There, two other parshmen began lowering her. Shallan eyed the basket of books. She could spend her time on the lift reading, maybe finish that section of\r\nWestern Voyages\u2026\r\nShe turned away from the basket.\r\nStay focused.On the fifth level down, she stepped out into the smaller walkway that connected the lift to the sloping ramps set into the walls. Upon reaching the wall, she turned right and continued down a little farther. The wall was lined with doorways and, finding the one she wanted, she entered a large stone chamber filled with tall bookshelves. \u201CWait here,\u201D she said to her parshman as she dug her drawing folio out of the basket. She tucked it under her arm, took the lantern, and hurried into the stacks.\r\nOne could disappear for hours in the Palanaeum and never see another soul. Shallan rarely saw anyone while searching out an obscure book for Jasnah. There were ardents and servants to fetch volumes, of course, but Jasnah thought it important for Shallan to practice doing it herself. Apparently the Kharbranthian filing system was now standard for many of Roshar\u2019s libraries and archives.\r\nAt the back of the room, she found a small desk of cobwood. She set her lantern on one side and sat on the stool, getting out her portfolio. The room was silent and dark, her lantern light revealing the ends of bookshelves to\u00A0her right and a smooth stone wall to her left. The air smelled of old paper and dust. Not wet. It was never damp in the Palanaeum. Perhaps the dryness had something to do with the long troughs of white powder at the ends of each room.\r\nShe undid her portfolio\u2019s leather ties. Inside, the top sheets were blank, and the next few contained drawings she\u2019d done of people in the Palanaeum. More faces for her collection. Hidden in the middle was a far more important set of drawings: sketches of Jasnah performing Soulcastings.\r\nThe princess used her Soulcaster infrequently; perhaps she hesitated to use it when Shallan was around. But Shallan had caught a handful of occasions, mostly when Jasnah had been distracted, and had apparently forgotten she wasn\u2019t alone.\r\nShallan held up one picture. Jasnah, sitting in the alcove, hand to the side and touching a crumpled piece of notepaper, a gem on her Soulcaster glowing. Shallan held up the next picture. It depicted the same scene just seconds later. The paper had become a ball of flames. It hadn\u2019t burned. No, it had\r\nbecome fire. Tongues of flame coiling, a flash of heat in the air. What had been on it that Jasnah wished to hide?\r\nAnother picture showed Jasnah Soulcasting the wine in her cup into a chunk of crystal to use as a paperweight, the goblet itself holding down another stack, on one of the rare occasions when they\u2019d dined\u2014and studied\u2014on a patio outside the Conclave. There was also the one of Jasnah burning words after running out of ink. When Shallan had seen her burning letters into a page, she\u2019d been amazed at the Soulcaster\u2019s precision.\r\nIt seemed that this Soulcaster was attuned to three Essences in particular: Vapor, Spark, and Lucentia. But it should be able to create any of the Ten Essences, from Zephyr to Talus. That last one was the most important to Shallan, as Talus included stone and earth. She\r\ncouldcreate new mineral deposits for her family to exploit. It would work; Soulcasters were very rare in Jah Keved, and her family\u2019s marble, jade, and opal would sell at a premium. They couldn\u2019t create actual gemstones with a Soulcaster\u2014that was said to be impossible\u2014but they could create other deposits of near equal value.\r\nOnce those new deposits ran out, they\u2019d have to move to less lucrative trades. That would be all right, though. By then, they\u2019d have paid off their debts and compensated those to whom promises had been broken. House Davar would become unimportant again, but would not collapse.\r\nShallan studied the pictures again. The Alethi princess seemed remarkably casual about Soulcasting. She held one of the most powerful artifacts in all of Roshar, and she used it to create\r\npaperweights? What else did she use the Soulcaster for, when Shallan wasn\u2019t watching? Jasnah seemed to use it less frequently in her presence now than she had at first.\r\nShallan fished in the safepouch inside her sleeve, bringing out her father\u2019s broken Soulcaster. It had been sheared in two places: across one of the chains and through the setting that held one of the stones. She inspected it in the light, looking\u2014not for the first time\u2014for signs of that damage. The link in the chain had been replaced perfectly and the setting reforged equally well. Even knowing exactly where the cuts had been, she couldn\u2019t find any flaw. Unfortunately, repairing only the outward defects hadn\u2019t made it functional.\r\nShe hefted the heavy construction of metal and chains. Then she put it on, looping chains around her thumb, small finger, and middle finger. There were no gemstones in the device at present. She compared the broken Soulcaster to the drawings, inspecting it from all sides. Yes, it looked identical. She\u2019d worried about that.\r\nShallan felt her heart flutter as she regarded the broken Soulcaster. Stealing from Jasnah had seemed acceptable when the princess had been a distant, unknown figure. A heretic, presumably ill-tempered and demanding. But what of the real Jasnah? A careful scholar, stern but fair, with a surprising level of wisdom and insight? Could Shallan really steal from her?\r\nShe tried to still her heart. Even as a little child, she\u2019d been this way. She could remember her tears at fights between her parents. She was not good with confrontation.\r\nBut she\u2019d do it. For Nan Balat, Tet Wikim, and Asha Jushu. Her brothers depended on her. She pressed her hands against her thighs to keep them from shaking, breathing in and out. After a few minutes, nerves under control, she took off the damaged Soulcaster and returned it to her safepouch. She gathered up her papers. They might be important in discovering how to use the Soulcaster. What was she going to do about that? Was there a way to ask Jasnah about using a Soulcaster without arousing suspicion?\r\nA light flickering through nearby bookcases startled her, and she tucked away her folio. It turned out to be just an old, berobed female ardent, shuffling with a lantern and followed by a parshman servant. She didn\u2019t look in Shallan\u2019s direction as she turned between two rows of shelves, her lantern\u2019s light shining out through the spaces between the books. Lit that way\u2014with her figure hidden but the light streaming between the shelves\u2014it looked as if one of the Heralds themselves were walking through the stacks.\r\nHer heart racing again, Shallan raised her safehand to her breast.\r\nI make a\u00A0terrible thief,she thought with a grimace. She finished gathering her things and moved through the stacks, lantern held before her. The head\u00A0 of each row was carved with symbols, indicating the date the books\u00A0had entered the Palanaeum. That was how they were organized. There were enormous cabinets filled with indexes on the top level.\r\nJasnah had sent Shallan to fetch\u2014and then read\u2014a copy of\r\nDialogues, a famous historical work on political theory. However, this was also the room that contained\r\nShadows Remembered\u2014the book Jasnah was reading when the king had visited. Shallan had later looked it up in the index. It might have been reshelved by now.\r\nSuddenly curious, Shallan counted off the rows. She stepped in and counted shelves inward. Near the middle and at the bottom, she found a thin red volume with a red hogshide cover.\r\nShadows Remembered. Shallan set her lantern on the ground and slipped the book free, feeling furtive as she flipped through the pages.\r\nShe was confused by what she discovered. She hadn\u2019t realized this was a book of children\u2019s stories. There was no undertext commentary, just a collection of tales. Shallan sat down on the floor, reading through the first one. It was the story of a child who wandered away from his home at night and was chased by Voidbringers until he hid in a cavern beside a lake. He whittled a piece of wood into a roughly human shape and sent it floating across the lake, fooling the creatures into attacking and eating it instead.\r\nShallan didn\u2019t have much time\u2014Jasnah would grow suspicious if she remained down here too long\u2014but she skimmed the rest of the stories. They were all of a similar style, ghost stories about spirits or Voidbringers. The only commentary was at the back, explaining that the author had been curious about the folktales told by common darkeyes. She had spent years collecting and recording them.\r\nShadows Remembered, Shallan thought,\r\nwould have been better off forgotten.\r\nThis was what Jasnah had been reading? Shallan had expected\r\nShadows Rememberedto be some kind of deep philosophical discussion of a hidden historical murder. Jasnah was a Veristitalian. She constructed the truth of what happened in the past. What kind of truth could she find in stories told to frighten disobedient darkeyed children?\r\nShallan slid the volume back in place and hurried on her way.\r\nA short time later, Shallan returned to the alcove to discover that her haste had been unnecessary. Jasnah wasn\u2019t there. Kabsal, however, was.\r\nThe youthful ardent sat at the long desk, flipping through one of Shallan\u2019s books on art. Shallan noticed him before he saw her, and she found herself smiling despite her troubles. She folded her arms and adopted a dubious expression. \u201CAgain?\u201D she asked.\r\nKabsal leaped up, slapping the book closed. \u201CShallan,\u201D he said, his bald head reflecting the blue light of her parshman\u2019s lantern. \u201CI came looking for\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CFor Jasnah,\u201D Shallan said. \u201CAs always. And yet, she\u2019s never here when you come.\u201D\r\n\u201CAn unfortunate coincidence,\u201D he said, raising a hand to his forehead. \u201CI am a poor judge of timing, am I not?\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd is that a basket of bread at your feet?\u201D\r\n\u201CA gift for Brightness Jasnah,\u201D he said. \u201CFrom the Devotary of Insight.\u201D\r\n\u201CI doubt a bread basket is going to persuade her to renounce her heresy,\u201D Shallan said. \u201CPerhaps if you\u2019d included jam.\u201D\r\nThe ardent smiled, picking up the basket and pulling out a small jar of red simberry jam.\r\n\u201COf course, I\u2019ve told you that Jasnah doesn\u2019t like jam,\u201D Shallan said \u201CAnd yet you bring it anyway, knowing jam to be among my favorite foods. And you\u2019ve done this oh\u2026a dozen times in the last few months?\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m growing a bit transparent, aren\u2019t I?\u201D\r\n\u201CJust a tad,\u201D she said, smiling. \u201CIt\u2019s about my soul, isn\u2019t it? You\u2019re worried about me because I\u2019m apprenticed to a heretic.\u201D\r\n\u201CEr\u2026well, yes, I\u2019m afraid.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019d be insulted,\u201D Shallan said. \u201CBut you\r\ndidbring jam.\u201D She smiled, waving for her parshman to deposit her books and then wait beside the doorway. Was it true that there were parshmen on the Shattered Plains who were\r\nfighting? That seemed hard to credit. She\u2019d never known any parshman to as much as raise their voice. They didn\u2019t seem bright enough for disobedience.\r\nOf course, some reports she\u2019d heard\u2014including those Jasnah had made her read when studying King Gavilar\u2019s murder\u2014indicated that the Parshendi weren\u2019t like other parshmen. They were bigger, had odd armor that grew from their skin itself, and spoke far more frequently. Perhaps they weren\u2019t parshmen at all, but some kind of distant cousin, a different race entirely.\r\nShe sat down at the desk as Kabsal got out the bread, her parshman waiting at the doorway. A parshman wasn\u2019t much of a chaperone, but Kabsal\r\nwasan ardent, which meant technically she didn\u2019t need one.\r\nThe bread had been purchased from a Thaylen bakery, which meant it was fluffy and brown. And, since he was an ardent, it didn\u2019t matter that jam was a feminine food\u2014they could enjoy it together. She eyed him as he cut the bread. The ardents in her father\u2019s employ had all been crusty men or women in their later years, stern-eyed and impatient with children. She\u2019d never even\r\nconsideredthat the devotaries would attract young men like Kabsal.\r\nDuring these last few weeks, she\u2019d found herself thinking of him in ways that would better have been avoided.\r\n\u201CHave you considered,\u201D he noted, \u201Cwhat kind of person you declare yourself to be by preferring simberry jam?\u201D\r\n\u201CI wasn\u2019t aware that my taste in jams could be that significant.\u201D\r\n\u201CThere are those who have studied it,\u201D Kabsal said, slathering on the thick red jam and handing her the slice. \u201CYou run across some very odd books, working in the Palanaeum. It\u2019s not hard to conclude that perhaps\r\neverythinghas been studied at one time or another.\u201D\r\n\u201CHum,\u201D Shallan said. \u201CAnd simberry jam?\u201D\r\n\u201CAccording to\r\nPalates of Personality\u2014and before you object,\r\nyesit is a real book, and that is its title\u2014a fondness for simberries indicates a spontaneous, impulsive personality. And also a preference for\u2014\u201D He cut off as a wadded-up piece of paper bounced off his forehead. He blinked.\r\n\u201CSorry,\u201D Shallan said. \u201CIt just kind of happened. Must be all that impulsiveness and spontaneity I have.\u201D\r\nHe smiled. \u201CYou disagree with the conclusions?\u201D\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know,\u201D she said with a shrug. \u201CI\u2019ve had people tell me they could determine my personality based on the day I was born, or the position of Taln\u2019s Scar on my seventh birthday, or by numerological extrapolations of the tenth glyphic paradigm. But I think we\u2019re more complicated than that.\u201D\r\n\u201CPeople are more complicated than the numerological extrapolations of the tenth glyphic paradigm?\u201D Kabsal said, spreading jam on a piece of bread for himself. \u201CNo wonder I have such difficulty understanding women.\u201D\r\n\u201CVery funny. I\r\nmeanthat we\u2019re more complex than mere bundles of personality traits. Am I spontaneous? Sometimes. You might describe my chasing Jasnah here to become her ward that way. But before that, I spent seventeen years being about as\r\nunspontaneous as someone could be. In many situations\u2014if I\u2019m encouraged\u2014my tongue can be quite spontaneous, but my actions rarely are. We\u2019re\r\nallspontaneous sometimes, and we\u2019re\r\nallconservative sometimes.\u201D\r\n\u201CSo you\u2019re saying that the book is right then. It says you\u2019re spontaneous; you\u2019re spontaneous sometimes. Ergo, it\u2019s correct.\u201D\r\n\u201CBy that argument, it\u2019s right about\r\neverybody.\u201D\r\n\u201COne hundred percent accurate!\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, not one hundred percent,\u201D Shallan said, swallowing another bite of the sweet, fluffy bread. \u201CAs has been noted, Jasnah hates jam of all kinds.\u201D\r\n\u201CAh yes,\u201D Kabsal said. \u201CShe\u2019s a\r\njam heretictoo. Her soul is in more danger than I had realized.\u201D He grinned and took a bite of his bread.\r\n\u201CIndeed,\u201D Shallan said. \u201CSo what else does that book of yours say about me\u2014and half the world\u2019s population\u2014because of our enjoyment of foods with far too much sugar in them?\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, a fondness for simberry is also supposed to indicate a love of the outdoors.\u201D\r\n\u201CAh, the outdoors,\u201D Shallan said. \u201CI visited that mythical place once. It was so very long ago, I\u2019ve nearly forgotten it. Tell me, does the sun still shine, or is that just my dreamy recollection?\u201D\r\n\u201CSurely your studies aren\u2019t\r\nthatbad.\u201D\r\n\u201CJasnah is inordinately fond of dust,\u201D Shallan said. \u201CI believe she thrives on it, feeding off the particles like a chull crunching rockbuds.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd you, Shallan? On what do\r\nyouthrive?\u201D\r\n\u201CCharcoal.\u201D\r\nHe looked confused at first, then glanced at her folio. \u201CAh yes. I was surprised at how quickly your name, and pictures, spread through the Conclave.\u201D\r\nShallan ate the last of her bread, then wiped her hands on a damp rag Kabsal had brought. \u201CYou make me sound like a disease.\u201D She ran a finger through her red hair, grimacing. \u201CI guess I do have the coloring of a rash, don\u2019t I?\u201D\r\n\u201CNonsense,\u201D he said sternly. \u201CYou shouldn\u2019t say such things, Brightness. It\u2019s disrespectful.\u201D\r\n\u201COf myself?\u201D\r\n\u201CNo. Of the Almighty, who made you.\u201D\r\n\u201CHe made cremlings too. Not to mentions rashes and diseases. So being compared to one is actually an honor.\u201D\r\n\u201CI fail to follow that logic, Brightness. As he created all things, comparisons are meaningless.\u201D\r\n\u201CLike the claims of your\r\nPalatesbook, eh?\u201D\r\n\u201CA point.\u201D\r\n\u201CThere are worse things to be than a disease,\u201D she said, idly thoughtful. \u201CWhen you have one, it reminds you that you\u2019re alive. Makes you fight for what you have. When the disease has run its course, normal healthy life seems wonderful by comparison.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd would you not rather be a sense of euphoria? Bringing pleasant feelings and joy to those you infect?\u201D\r\n\u201CEuphoria passes. It is usually brief, so we spend more time longing for it than enjoying it.\u201D She sighed. \u201CLook what we\u2019ve done. Now I\u2019m depressed. At least turning back to my studies will seem exciting by comparison.\u201D\r\nHe frowned at the books. \u201CI was under the impression that you enjoyed your studies.\u201D\r\n\u201CAs was I. Then Jasnah Kholin stomped into my life and proved that even something pleasant could become boring.\u201D\r\n\u201CI see. So she\u2019s a harsh mistress?\u201D\r\n\u201CActually, no,\u201D Shallan said. \u201CI\u2019m just fond of hyperbole.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m not,\u201D he said. \u201CIt\u2019s a real bastard to spell.\u201D\r\n\u201CKabsal!\u201D\r\n\u201CSorry,\u201D he said. Then he glanced upward. \u201CSorry.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m sure the ceiling forgives you. To get the Almighty\u2019s attention, you might want to burn a prayer instead.\u201D\r\n\u201CI owe him a few anyway,\u201D Kabsal said. \u201CYou were saying?\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, Brightness Jasnah\r\nisn\u2019ta harsh mistress. She\u2019s actually everything she\u2019s said to be. Brilliant, beautiful, mysterious. I\u2019m fortunate to be her ward.\u201D\r\nKabsal nodded. \u201CShe is said to be a sterling woman, save for one thing.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou mean the heresy?\u201D\r\nHe nodded.\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s not as bad for me as you think,\u201D she said. \u201CShe\u2019s rarely vocal about her beliefs unless provoked.\u201D\r\n\u201CShe\u2019s ashamed, then.\u201D\r\n\u201CI doubt that. Merely considerate.\u201D\r\nHe eyed her.\r\n\u201CYou needn\u2019t worry about me,\u201D Shallan said. \u201CJasnah doesn\u2019t try to persuade me to abandon the devotaries.\u201D\r\nKabsal leaned forward, growing more somber. He was older than she\u2014a man in his mid-twenties, confident, self-assured, and earnest. He was practically the only man near her age that she\u2019d ever talked to outside of her father\u2019s careful supervision.\r\nBut he was also an ardent. So, of course, nothing could come of it. Could it?\r\n\u201CShallan,\u201D Kabsal said gently, \u201Ccan you not see how we\u2014how I\u2014would be concerned? Brightness Jasnah is a very powerful and intriguing woman. We would expect her ideas to be infectious.\u201D\r\n\u201CInfectious? I thought you said\r\nIwas the disease.\u201D\r\n\u201CI never said that!\u201D\r\n\u201CYes, but I pretended you did. Which is virtually the same thing.\u201D\r\nHe frowned. \u201CBrightness Shallan, the ardents\r\nareworried about you. The souls of the Almighty\u2019s children are our responsibility. Jasnah has a history of corrupting those with whom she comes in contact.\u201D\r\n\u201CReally?\u201D Shallan asked, genuinely interested. \u201COther wards?\u201D\r\n\u201CIt is not my place to say.\u201D\r\n\u201CWe can move to another place.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m firm on this point, Brightness. I will not speak of it.\u201D\r\n\u201CWrite it, then.\u201D\r\n\u201CBrightness\u2026\u201D he said, voice taking on a suffering tone.\r\n\u201COh, all right,\u201D she said, sighing. \u201CWell, I can assure you, my soul is quite well and thoroughly\r\nuninfected.\u201D\r\nHe sat back, then cut another piece of bread. She found herself studying him again, but grew annoyed at her own girlish foolishness. She would soon be returning to her family, and he was only visiting her for reasons relating to his Calling. But she truly\r\nwasfond of his company. He was the only one here in Kharbranth that she felt she could really talk to. And he was handsome; the simple clothing and shaved head only highlighted his strong features. Like many young ardents, he kept his beard short and neatly trimmed. He spoke with a refined voice, and he was so well-read.\r\n\u201CWell, if you\u2019re certain about your soul,\u201D he said, turning back to her. \u201CThen perhaps I could interest you in our devotary.\u201D\r\n\u201CI have a devotary. The Devotary of Purity.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut the Devotary of Purity isn\u2019t the place for a scholar. The Glory it advocates has nothing to do with your studies or your art.\u201D\r\n\u201CA person doesn\u2019t need a devotary that focuses directly on their Calling.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt is nice when the two coincide, though.\u201D\r\nShallan stifled a grimace. The Devotary of Purity focused on\u2014as one might imagine\u2014teaching one to emulate the Almighty\u2019s honesty and wholesomeness. The ardents at the devotary hall hadn\u2019t known what to make of her fascination with art. They\u2019d always wanted her to do sketches of things they found \u201Cpure.\u201D Statues of the Heralds, depictions of the Double Eye.\r\nHer father had chosen the devotary for her, of course.\r\n\u201CI just wonder if you made an informed choice,\u201D Kabsal said. \u201CSwitching devotaries is allowed, after all.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes, but isn\u2019t recruitment frowned upon? Ardents competing for members?\u201D\r\n\u201CIt is indeed frowned upon. A deplorable habit.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut you do it anyway?\u201D\r\n\u201CI curse occasionally too.\u201D\r\n\u201CI hadn\u2019t noticed. You\u2019re a very curious ardent, Kabsal.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou\u2019d be surprised. We\u2019re not nearly as stuffy a bunch as we seem. Well, except Brother Habsant; he spends so much time staring at the rest of us.\u201D He hesitated. \u201CActually, now I think about it, he might actually\r\nbestuffed. I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve ever seen him move\u2026.\u201D\r\n\u201CWe\u2019re getting distracted. Weren\u2019t you trying to recruit me to your devotary?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes. And it\u2019s not so uncommon as you think. All of the devotaries engage in it. We do a lot of frowning at one another for our profound lack of ethics.\u201D He leaned forward again, growing more serious. \u201CMy devotary has relatively few members, as we don\u2019t have as much exposure as others. So whenever someone seeking knowledge comes to the Palanaeum, we take it upon ourselves to inform them.\u201D\r\n\u201CRecruit them.\u201D\r\n\u201CLet them see what it is they are missing.\u201D He took a bite of his bread and jam. \u201CIn the Devotary of Purity, did they teach you about the nature of the Almighty? The divine prism, with the ten facets representing the Heralds?\u201D\r\n\u201CThey touched on it,\u201D she said. \u201CMostly we talked about achieving my goals of\u2026well, purity. Somewhat boring, I\u2019ll admit, since there wasn\u2019t much chance for\r\nimpurity on my part.\u201D\r\nKabsal shook his head. \u201CThe Almighty gives everyone talents\u2014and when we pick a Calling that capitalizes on them, we are worshipping him in\u00A0the most fundamental way. A devotary\u2014and its ardents\u2014should help nurture that, encouraging you to set and achieve goals of excellence.\u201D He waved to the books stacked on the desk. \u201CThis is what your devotary should be helping you with, Shallan. History, logic, science, art. Being honest and good is important, but we should be working harder to encourage the natural talents of people, rather than forcing them to adapt to the Glories and Callings we feel are most important.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat is a reasonable argument, I guess.\u201D\r\nKabsal nodded, looking thoughtful \u201CIs it any wonder a woman like Jasnah Kholin turned away from that? Many devotaries encourage women to leave difficult studies of theology to the ardents. If only Jasnah had been able to see the true beauty of our doctrine.\u201D He smiled, digging a thick book out of his bread basket. \u201CI really had hoped, originally, to be able to show her what I mean.\u201D\r\n\u201CI doubt she\u2019d react well to that.\u201D\r\n\u201CPerhaps,\u201D he said idly, hefting the tome. \u201CBut to be the one who finally convinced her!\u201D\r\n\u201CBrother Kabsal, that sounds almost like you\u2019re seeking distinction.\u201D\r\nHe blushed, and she realized she\u2019d said something that genuinely embarrassed him. She winced, cursing her tongue.\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D he said. \u201CI do seek distinction. I\r\nshouldn\u2019twish so badly to be the one who converts her. But I do. If she would just listen to my proof.\u201D\r\n\u201CProof?\u201D\r\n\u201CI have real evidence that the Almighty exists.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019d like to see it.\u201D Then she raised a finger, cutting him off. \u201CNot because I doubt his existence, Kabsal. I\u2019m just curious.\u201D\r\nHe smiled. \u201CIt will be my pleasure to explain. But first, would you like another slice of bread?\u201D\r\n\u201CI should say no,\u201D she said, \u201Cand avoid excess, as my tutors trained me. But instead I\u2019ll say yes.\u201D\r\n\u201CBecause of the jam?\u201D\r\n\u201COf course,\u201D she said, taking the bread. \u201CHow did your book of oracular preserves describe me? Impulsive and spontaneous? I can do that. If it means jam.\u201D\r\nHe slathered a piece for her, then wiped his fingers on his cloth and opened his book, flipping through the pages until he reached one that had a drawing on it. Shallan slid closer for a better look. The picture wasn\u2019t of a person; it depicted a pattern of some kind. A triangular shape, with three outlying wings and a peaked center.\r\n\u201CDo you recognize this?\u201D Kabsal asked.\r\nIt seemed familiar. \u201CI feel that I should.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s Kholinar,\u201D he said. \u201CThe Alethi capital, drawn as it would appear from above. See the peaks here, the ridges there? It was built around the rock formation that was already there.\u201D He flipped the page. \u201CHere\u2019s Vedenar, capital of Jah Keved.\u201D This one was a hexagonal pattern. \u201CAkinah.\u201D A circular pattern. \u201CThaylen City.\u201D A four-pointed star pattern.\r\n\u201CWhat does it mean?\u201D\r\n\u201CIt is proof that the Almighty is in all things. You can see him here, in these cities. Do you see how symmetrical they are?\u201D\r\n\u201CThe cities were built by men, Kabsal. They wanted symmetry because it is holy.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes, but in each case they built around existing rock formations.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat doesn\u2019t mean anything,\u201D Shallan said. \u201CI do believe, but I don\u2019t know if\r\nthisis proof. Wind and water can create symmetry; you see it in nature all the time. The men picked areas that were roughly symmetrical, then designed their cities to make up for any flaws.\u201D\r\nHe turned to his basket again, rummaging. He came out with\u2014of all things\u2014a metal plate. As she opened her mouth to ask a question, he held up his finger again and set the plate down on a small wooden stand that raised it a few inches above the tabletop.\r\nKabsal sprinkled white, powdery sand on the sheet of metal, coating\u00A0it. Then he got out a bow, the kind drawn across strings to make music.\r\n\u201CYou came prepared for this demonstration, I see,\u201D Shallan noted. \u201CYou really\r\ndidwant to make your case to Jasnah.\u201D\r\nHe smiled, then drew the bow across the edge of the metal plate, making it vibrate. The sand hopped and bounced, like tiny insects dropped onto something hot.\r\n\u201CThis,\u201D he said, \u201Cis called cymatics. The study of the patterns that sounds make when interacting with a physical medium.\u201D\r\nAs he drew the bow again, the plate made a sound, almost a pure note. It was actually enough to draw a single musicspren, which spun for a moment in the air above him, then vanished. Kabsal finished, then gestured to the plate with a flourish.\r\n\u201CSo\u2026?\u201D Shallan asked.\r\n\u201CKholinar,\u201D he said, holding up his book for comparison.\r\nShallan cocked her head. The pattern in the sand looked\r\nexactlylike Kholinar.\r\nHe dropped more sand on the plate and then drew the bow across it at another point and the sand rearranged itself.\r\n\u201CVedenar,\u201D he said.\r\nShe compared again. It was an exact match.\r\n\u201CThaylen City,\u201D he said, repeating the process at another spot. He carefully chose another point on the plate\u2019s edge and bowed it one final time. \u201CAkinah. Shallan, proof of the Almighty\u2019s existence is in the very cities we live in. Look at the perfect symmetry!\u201D\r\nShe had to admit, there was something compelling about the patterns. \u201CIt could be a false correlation. Both caused by the same thing.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes. The Almighty,\u201D he said, sitting. \u201COur very language is symmetrical. Look at the glyphs\u2014each one can be folded in half perfectly. And the alphabet too. Fold any line of text down across itself, and you\u2019ll find symmetry. Surely you know the story, that both glyphs and letters came from the Dawnsingers?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes.\u201D\r\n\u201CEven our names. Yours is nearly perfect. Shallan. One letter off, an ideal name for a lighteyed woman. Not\r\ntooholy, but ever so close. The original names for the ten Silver Kingdoms. Alethela, Valhav, Shin Kak Nish. Perfect, symmetrical.\u201D\r\nHe reached forward, taking her hand. \u201CIt\u2019s here, around us. Don\u2019t forget that, Shallan, no matter what she says.\u201D\r\n\u201CI won\u2019t,\u201D she said, realizing how he\u2019d guided the conversation. He\u2019d said he believed her, but still he\u2019d gone through his proofs. It was touching and annoying at the same time. She did not like condescension. But, then, could one really blame an ardent for preaching?\r\nKabsal looked up suddenly, releasing her hand. \u201CI hear footsteps.\u201D He stood, and Shallan turned as Jasnah walked into the alcove, followed by a parshman carrying a basket of books. Jasnah showed no surprise at the presence of the ardent.\r\n\u201CI\u2019m sorry, Brightness Jasnah,\u201D Shallan said, standing. \u201CHe\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CYou are not a captive, child,\u201D Jasnah interrupted brusquely. \u201CYou are allowed visitors. Just be careful to check your skin for tooth marks. These types have a habit of dragging their prey out to sea with them.\u201D\r\nKabsal flushed. He moved to gather up his things.\r\nJasnah waved for the parshman to place her books on the table. \u201CCan that plate reproduce a cymatic pattern corresponding to Urithiru, priest? Or do you only have patterns for the standard four cities?\u201D\r\nKabsal looked at her, obviously shocked to realize that she knew exactly what the plate was for. He picked up his book. \u201CUrithiru is just a fable.\u201D\r\n\u201COdd. One would think that your type would be used to believing in fables.\u201D\r\nHis face grew redder. He finished packing his things, then nodded curtly to Shallan and walked hastily from the room.\r\n\u201CIf I may say so, Brightness,\u201D Shallan said, \u201Cthat was\r\nexceptionallyrude of you.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m prone to such bouts of incivility,\u201D Jasnah said. \u201CI\u2019m certain he has heard what I\u2019m like. I simply wanted to make sure he got what he expected.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou haven\u2019t acted that way toward other ardents in the Palanaeum.\u201D\r\n\u201CThe other ardents in the Palanaeum haven\u2019t been working to turn my ward against me.\u201D\r\n\u201CHe wasn\u2019t\u2026\u201D Shallan trailed off. \u201CHe was simply worried about my soul.\u201D\r\n\u201CHas he asked you to try to steal my Soulcaster yet?\u201D\r\nShallan felt a sudden spike of shock. Her hand went to the pouch at her waist. Did Jasnah know?\r\nNo,Shallan told herself.\r\nNo, listen to the question.\u201CHe didn\u2019t.\u201D\r\n\u201CWatch,\u201D Jasnah said, opening a book. \u201CHe will eventually. I\u2019ve experience with his type.\u201D She looked at Shallan, and her expression softened. \u201CHe\u2019s not interested in you. Not in any of the ways you think. In particular, this isn\u2019t about your soul. It\u2019s about me.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat is somewhat arrogant of you,\u201D Shallan said, \u201Cdon\u2019t you think?\u201D\r\n\u201COnly if I\u2019m wrong, child,\u201D Jasnah said, turning back to her book. \u201CAnd I rarely am.\u201D"

      "ChapterName": "34: STORMWALL",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\n\u201CI walked from Abamabar to Urithiru.\u201D\r\n\u2014This quote from the Eighth Parable of\r\nThe Way of Kingsseems to contradict Varala and Sinbian, who both claim the city was inaccessible by foot. Perhaps there was a way constructed, or perhaps Nohadon was being metaphorical.\r\nBridgemen aren\u2019t supposed to survive\u2026.\r\nKaladin\u2019s mind felt fuzzy. He knew that he\r\nhurt, but other than that, he floated. As if his head were detached from his body and bouncing off the walls and ceilings.\r\n\u201CKaladin!\u201D a concerned voice whispered. \u201CKaladin, please. Please don\u2019t be hurt anymore.\u201D\r\nBridgemen aren\u2019t supposed to survive.Why did those words bother him so much? He remembered what had happened, using the bridge as a shield, throwing the army off, dooming the assault.\r\nStormfather, he thought,\r\nI\u2019m an idiot!\r\n\u201CKaladin?\u201D\r\nIt was Syl\u2019s voice. He risked opening his eyes and looked out on an upside-down world, sky extending below him, familiar lumberyard in the air above him.\r\nNo.\r\nHewas upside down. Hanging against the side of Bridge Four\u2019s barrack. The Soulcast building was fifteen feet tall at its peak, with a shallowly slanted roof. Kaladin was tied by his ankles to a rope, which would\u2014in turn\u2014be affixed to a ring set into the slanted roof. He\u2019d seen it happen to other bridgemen. One who had committed a murder in camp, another who had been caught stealing for the fifth time.\r\nHis back was to the wall so that he faced eastward. His arms were free, hanging down at his sides, and they almost touched the ground. He groaned again, hurting everywhere.\r\nAs his father had trained him, he began to prod his side to check for broken ribs. He winced as he found several that were tender, at least cracked. Probably broken. He felt at his shoulder too, where he feared that his collarbone was broken. One of his eyes was swollen. Time would show if he\u2019d sustained any serious internal damage.\r\nHe rubbed his face, and flakes of dried blood cracked free and fluttered toward the ground. Gash on his head, bloodied nose, split lip. Syl landed on his chest, feet planted on his sternum, hands clasped before her. \u201CKaladin?\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m alive,\u201D he mumbled, words slurred by his swollen lip. \u201CWhat happened?\u201D\r\n\u201CYou were beaten by those soldiers,\u201D she said, seeming to grow smaller. \u201CI\u2019ve gotten back at them. I made one of them trip three times today.\u201D She looked concerned.\r\nHe found himself smiling. How long could a man hang like this, blood going to his head?\r\n\u201CThere was a lot of yelling,\u201D Syl said softly. \u201CI think several men were demoted. The soldier, Lamaril, he\u2026\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat?\u201D\r\n\u201CHe was executed,\u201D Syl said, even more quietly. \u201CHighprince Sadeas did it himself, the hour the army got back from the plateau. He said something about the ultimate responsibility falling on the lighteyes. Lamaril kept screaming that you had promised to absolve him, and that Gaz should be punished instead.\u201D\r\nKaladin smirked ruefully. \u201CHe shouldn\u2019t have had me beaten senseless. Gaz?\u201D\r\n\u201CThey left him in his position. I don\u2019t know why.\u201D\r\n\u201CRight of responsibility. In a disaster like this, the lighteyes are supposed to take most of the blame. They like to make a show of obeying old precepts like that, when it suits them. Why am I still alive?\u201D\r\n\u201CSomething about an example,\u201D Syl said, wrapping her translucent arms around herself. \u201CKaladin, I feel cold.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou can feel temperature?\u201D Kaladin said, coughing.\r\n\u201CNot usually. I can now. I don\u2019t understand it. I\u2026I don\u2019t like it.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\u2019ll be all right.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou shouldn\u2019t lie.\u201D\r\n\u201CSometimes it\u2019s all right to lie, Syl.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd this is one of those times?\u201D\r\nHe blinked, trying to ignore his wounds, the pressure in his head, trying to clear his mind. He failed on all counts. \u201CYes,\u201D he whispered.\r\n\u201CI think I understand.\u201D\r\n\u201CSo,\u201D Kaladin said, resting his head back, the parietal knob of his skull resting against the wall, \u201CI\u2019m to be judged by the highstorm. They\u2019ll let the storm kill me.\u201D\r\nHanging here, Kaladin would be exposed directly to the winds and everything they would throw at him. If you were prudent and took appropriate action, it\r\nwaspossible to survive outside in a highstorm, though it was a miserable experience. Kaladin had done it on several occasions, hunkered down, taking shelter in the lee of a rock formation. But hanging on a wall facing directly stormward? He\u2019d be cut to ribbons and crushed by stones.\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll be right back,\u201D Syl said, dropping off his chest, taking the form of a falling stone, then changing into windblown leaves near the ground and fluttering away, curving to the right. The lumberyard was empty. Kaladin could smell the crisp, chill air, the land bracing for a highstorm. The lull, it was called, when the wind fell still, the air cold, the pressure dropping, the humidity rising right before a storm.\r\nA few seconds later, Rock poked his head around the wall, Syl on his shoulder. He crept up to Kaladin, a nervous Teft following. They were joined by Moash; despite the latter\u2019s protests that he didn\u2019t trust Kaladin, he looked almost as concerned as the other two.\r\n\u201CLordling?\u201D Moash said. \u201CYou awake?\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m conscious,\u201D Kaladin croaked. \u201CEveryone get back from the battle all right?\u201D\r\n\u201CAll of our men, sure enough,\u201D Teft said, scratching at his beard. \u201CBut we lost the battle. It was a disaster. Over two hundred bridgemen dead. Those who survived were only enough to carry eleven bridges.\u201D\r\nTwo hundred men,Kaladin thought.\r\nThat\u2019s my fault. I protected my own at the cost of others. I was too hasty.\r\nBridgemen aren\u2019t supposed to survive. There\u2019s something about that.He wouldn\u2019t be able to ask Lamaril. That man had gotten what he deserved, though. If Kaladin had the ability to choose, such would be the end of all lighteyes, the king included.\r\n\u201CWe wanted to say something,\u201D Rock said. \u201CIs from all of the men. Most wouldn\u2019t come out. Highstorm coming, and\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s all right,\u201D Kaladin whispered.\r\nTeft nudged Rock to continue.\r\n\u201CWell, is this. We will remember you. Bridge Four, we won\u2019t go back to how we were. Maybe all of us will die, but we\u2019ll show the new ones. Fires at night. Laughter. Living. We\u2019ll make a tradition out of it. For you.\u201D Rock and Teft knew about the knobweed. They could keep earning extra money to pay for things.\r\n\u201CYou did this for us,\u201D Moash put in. \u201CWe\u2019d have died on that field. Perhaps as many as died in the other bridge crews. This way, we\u2019re only going to lose one.\u201D\r\n\u201CI say it isn\u2019t right, what they\u2019re doing,\u201D Teft said with a scowl. \u201CWe talked about cutting you down\u2026.\u201D\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CThat would only earn you a similar punishment.\u201D\r\nThe three men shared glances. It seemed they\u2019d come to the same conclusion.\r\n\u201CWhat did Sadeas say?\u201D Kaladin asked. \u201CAbout me.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat he understood how a bridgeman would want to save his life,\u201D Teft said, \u201Ceven at others\u2019 expense. He called you a selfish coward, but acted like that was all that could be expected.\u201D\r\n\u201CHe says he\u2019s letting the Stormfather judge you,\u201D Moash added. \u201CJezerezeh, king of Heralds. He says that if you deserve to live, you will\u2026.\u201D He trailed off. He knew as well as the others that unprotected men didn\u2019t survive highstorms, not like this.\r\n\u201CI want you three to do something for me,\u201D Kaladin said, closing his eyes against the blood trickling down his face from his lip, which he\u2019d cracked open by speaking.\r\n\u201CAnything, Kaladin,\u201D Rock said.\r\n\u201CI want you to go back into the barrack and tell the men to come out after the storm. Tell them to look up at me tied here. Tell them I\u2019ll open my eyes and look back at them, and they\u2019ll know that I survived.\u201D\r\nThe three bridgemen fell silent.\r\n\u201CYes, of course, Kaladin,\u201D Teft said. \u201CWe\u2019ll do it.\u201D\r\n\u201CTell them,\u201D Kaladin continued, voice firmer, \u201Cthat it won\u2019t end here. Tell them I\r\nchosenot to take my own life, and so there\u2019s no way in D\r\namnationI\u2019m going to give it up to Sadeas.\u201D\r\nRock smiled one of those broad smiles of his. \u201CBy the\r\nuli\u2019tekanaki, Kaladin. I almost believe you\u2019ll do it.\u201D\r\n\u201CHere,\u201D Teft said, handing him something. \u201CFor luck.\u201D\r\nKaladin took the object in a weak, bloodstained hand. It was a sphere, a full skymark. It was dun, the Stormlight gone from it.\r\nCarry a sphere with you into the storm,the old saying said,\r\nand at least you\u2019ll have light by which to see.\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s all we were able to save from your pouch,\u201D Teft said. \u201CGaz and Lamaril got the rest. We complained, but what were we to do?\u201D\r\n\u201CThank you,\u201D Kaladin said.\r\nMoash and Rock retreated to the safety of the barrack, Syl leaving Rock\u2019s shoulder to stay with Kaladin. Teft lingered too, as if thinking to spend the storm with Kaladin. He eventually shook his head, muttering, and joined the others. Kaladin thought he heard the man calling himself a coward.\r\nThe door to the barrack shut. Kaladin fingered the smooth glass sphere. The sky was darkening, and not just because the sun was setting. Blackness gathered. The highstorm.\r\nSyl walked up the side of the wall, then sat down on it, looking at him, tiny face somber. \u201CYou told them you\u2019d survive. What happens if you don\u2019t?\u201D\r\nKaladin\u2019s head was pounding with his pulse. \u201CMy mother would cringe if she knew how quickly the other soldiers taught me to gamble. First night in Amaram\u2019s army, and they had me playing for spheres.\u201D\r\n\u201CKaladin?\u201D Syl said.\r\n\u201CSorry,\u201D Kaladin said, rocking his head from side to side. \u201CWhat you said, it reminded me of that night. There\u2019s a term in gambling, you see. \u2018In for all,\u2019 they say. It\u2019s when you put all of your money on one bet.\u201D\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t understand.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m putting it all on the long bet,\u201D Kaladin whispered. \u201CIf I die, then they\u2019ll come out, shake their heads, and tell themselves they knew it would happen. But if I live, they\u2019ll remember it. And it will give them hope. They might see it as a miracle.\u201D\r\nSyl was silent for a moment. \u201CDo you want to be a miracle?\u201D\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D Kaladin whispered. \u201CBut for them, I will be.\u201D\r\nIt was a desperate, foolish hope. The eastern horizon, inverted in his sight, was growing darker. From this perspective, the storm was like the shadow of some enormous beast lumbering across the ground. He felt the disturbing fuzziness of a person who had been hit too hard on the head. Concussion. That was what it was called. He was having trouble thinking, but he didn\u2019t want to fall unconscious. He wanted to stare at the highstorm straight on, though it terrified him. He felt the same panic he\u2019d felt looking down into the black chasm, back when he\u2019d nearly killed himself. It was the fear of what he could not see, what he could not know.\r\nThe stormwall approached, the visible curtain of rain and wind at the advent of a highstorm. It was a massive wave of water, dirt, and rocks, hundreds of feet high, thousands upon thousands of windspren zipping before it.\r\nIn battle, he\u2019d been able to fight his way to safety with the skill of his spear. When he\u2019d stepped to the edge of the chasm, there had been a line of retreat. This time, there was nothing. No way to fight or avoid that black beast, that shadow spanning the entirety of the horizon, plunging the world into an early night. The eastern edge of the crater that made the warcamp had been worn away, and Bridge Four\u2019s barrack was first in its row. There was nothing between him and the Plains. Nothing between him and the storm.\r\nStaring at that raging, blustering, churning wave of wind-pushed water and debris, Kaladin felt as if he were watching the end of the world descend upon him.\r\nHe took a deep breath, the pain of his ribs forgotten, as the stormwall crossed the lumberyard in a flash and slammed into him."

      "ChapterName": "35: A LIGHT BY WHICH TO SEE",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\n\u201CThough many wished Urithiru to be built in Alethela, it was obvious that it could not be. And so it was that we asked for it to be placed westward, in the place nearest to Honor.\u201D\r\n\u2014Perhaps the oldest surviving original source mentioning the city, requoted in\r\nThe Vavibrar, line 1804. What I wouldn\u2019t give for a way to translate the Dawnchant.\r\nThe force of the stormwall nearly knocked him unconscious, but the sudden chill of it shocked him lucid.\r\nFor a moment, Kaladin couldn\u2019t feel anything but that coldness. He was pressed against the side of the barrack by the extended blast of water. Rocks and bits of branch crashed against the stone around him; he was already too numb to tell how many slashed or beat against his skin.\r\nHe bore it, dazed, eyes pressed shut and breath held. Then the stormwall passed, crashing onward. The next blast of wind came in from the side\u2014the air was swirling and gusting from all directions now. The wind flung him sideways\u2014his back scraping against stone\u2014and up into the air. The wind stabilized, blowing out of the east again. Kaladin hung in darkness, and his feet yanked against the rope. In a panic, he realized that he was now flapping in the wind like a kite, tied to the ring in the barrack\u2019s slanted roof.\r\nOnly that rope kept him from being blown along with the other debris to be tumbled and tossed before the storm across the entirety of Roshar. For those few heartbeats, he could not think. He could only feel the panic and the cold\u2014one boiling out of his chest, the other trying to freeze him from the skin inward. He screamed, clutching his single sphere as if it were a lifeline. The scream was a mistake, as it let that coldness course into his mouth. Like a spirit forcing its arm down his throat.\r\nThe wind was like a maelstrom, chaotic, moving in different directions. One buffet ripped at him, then passed, and he fell to the roof of the barrack with a thud. Almost immediately, the terrible winds tried to lift him again, pounding his skin with waves of icy water. Thunder crashed, the heartbeat of the beast that had swallowed him. Lighting split the darkness like white teeth in the night. The wind was so loud it nearly drowned out the thunder; howling and moaning.\r\n\u201CGrab the roof, Kaladin!\u201D\r\nSyl\u2019s voice. So soft, so small. How could he hear it at all?\r\nNumbly, he realized he was lying facedown on the sloped roof. It wasn\u2019t so steeply peaked that he was immediately pitched off, and the wind was generally blowing him backward. He did as Syl said, grabbing the lip of the roof with cold, slick fingers. Then he lay facedown, head tucked between his arms. He still had the sphere in his hand, pressed against the stone rooftop. His fingers started to slip. The wind was blowing so hard, trying to push him to the west. If he let go, he\u2019d end up dangling in the air again. His rope tether was not long enough for him to get to the other side of the shallow-peaked rooftop, where he\u2019d be sheltered.\r\nA boulder hit the roof beside him\u2014he couldn\u2019t hear its impact or see it in the tempest\u2019s darkness, but he could\r\nfeelthe building vibrate. The boulder rolled forward and crashed down to the ground. The entire storm didn\u2019t have such force, but occasional gusts could pick up and toss large objects, hurling them hundreds of feet.\r\nHis fingers slipped further.\r\n\u201CThe ring,\u201D Syl whispered.\r\nThe ring. The rope tied his legs to a steel ring on the side of the roof behind him. Kaladin let go, then snatched the ring as he was blown backward. He clutched to it. The rope continued down to his ankles, about the length of his body. He thought for a moment of untying the ropes, but he didn\u2019t dare let go of the ring. He clung there, like a pennant flapping in the wind, holding the ring in both hands, sphere cupped inside one of them and pressed against the steel.\r\nEach moment was a struggle. The wind yanked him left, then hurled him right. He couldn\u2019t know how long it lasted; time had no meaning in this place of fury and tumult. His numbed, battered mind started to think he was in a nightmare. A terrible dream inside his head, full of black, living winds. Screams in the air, bright and white, the flash of lightning revealing a terrible, twisted world of chaos and terror. The very buildings seemed blown sideways, the entire world askew, warped by the storm\u2019s terrible power.\r\nIn those brief moments of light when he dared to look, he thought he saw Syl standing in front of him, her face to the wind, tiny hands forward. As if she were trying to hold back the storm and split the winds as a stone divided the waters of a swift stream.\r\nThe cold of the rainwater numbed the scrapes and bruises. But it also numbed his fingers. He didn\u2019t feel them slipping. The next he knew, he was whipping in the air again, tossed to the side, being slammed down against the roof of the barrack.\r\nHe hit hard. His vision flashed with sparkling lights that melded together and were followed by blackness.\r\nNot unconsciousness, blackness.\r\nKaladin blinked. All was still. The storm was quiet, and everything was purely dark.\r\nI\u2019m dead,he thought immediately. But why could he feel the wet stone roof beneath him? He shook his head, dripping rainwater down his face. There was no lightning, no wind, no rain. The silence was unnatural.\r\nHe stumbled to his feet, managing to stand on the gently sloped roof. The stone was slick beneath his toes. He couldn\u2019t feel his wounds. The pain just wasn\u2019t there.\r\nHe opened his mouth to call out into the darkness, but hesitated. That silence was not to be broken. The air itself seemed to weigh less, as did he. He almost felt as if he could float away.\r\nIn that darkness, an enormous face appeared just in front of his. A face of blackness, yet faintly traced in the dark. It was wide, the breadth of a massive thunderhead, and extended far to either side, yet it was somehow still visible to Kaladin. Inhuman. Smiling.\r\nKaladin felt a deep chill\u2014a rolling prickle of ice\u2014scurry down his spine and through his entire body. The sphere suddenly burst to life in his hand, flaring with a sapphire glow. It illuminated the stone roof beneath him, making his fist blaze with blue fire. His shirt was in tatters, his skin lacerated. He looked down at himself, shocked, then looked up at the face.\r\nIt was gone. There was only the darkness.\r\nLightning flashed, and Kaladin\u2019s pains returned. He gasped, falling to his knees before the rain and the wind. He slipped down, face hitting the rooftop.\r\nWhat had that been? A vision? A delusion? His strength was fleeing him, his thoughts growing muddled again. The winds weren\u2019t as strong now, but the rain was still so cold. Lethargic, confused, nearly overwhelmed by his pain, he brought his hand up to the side and looked at the sphere. It was glowing. Smeared with his blood and glowing.\r\nHe hurt so much, and his strength had faded. Closing his eyes, he felt himself enveloped by a second blackness. The blackness of unconsciousness.\r\nRock was the first to the door when the highstorm subsided. Teft followed more slowly, groaning to himself. His knees hurt. His knees\r\nalwayshurt near a storm. His grandfather had complained about that in his later years, and Teft had called him daft. Now he felt it too.\r\nStorming Damnation,he thought, wearily stepping outside. It was still raining, of course. These were the after-flurries of drizzle that trailed a highstorm, the riddens. A few rainspren sat in puddles, like blue candles, and a few windspren danced in the stormwinds. The rain was cold, and he splashed through puddles that soaked his sandaled feet, chilling them straight through the skin and muscle. He hated being wet. But, then, he hated a lot of things.\r\nFor a while, life had been looking up. Not now.\r\nHow did everything go so wrong so quickly?he thought, holding his arms close, walking slowly and watching his feet. Some soldiers had left their barracks and stood nearby, wearing raincloaks, watching. Probably to make certain nobody had snuck out to cut Kaladin down early. They didn\u2019t try to stop Rock, though. The storm had passed.\r\nRock charged around the side of the building. Other bridgemen left the barrack behind as Teft followed Rock. Storming Horneater. Like a big lumbering chull. He actually believed. He thought they\u2019d find that foolish young bridgeleader alive. Probably figured they\u2019d discover him having a nice cup of tea, relaxing in the shade with the Stormfather himself.\r\nAnd you don\u2019t believe?Teft asked himself, still looking down.\r\nIf you don\u2019t, why are you following? But if you did believe, you\u2019d look. You wouldn\u2019t stare at your feet. You\u2019d look up and see.\r\nCould a man both believe, and not believe, at the same time? Teft stopped beside Rock and\u2014steeling himself\u2014looked up at the wall of the barrack.\r\nThere he saw what he\u2019d expected and what he\u2019d feared. The corpse looked like a hunk of slaughter house meat, skinned and bled. Was that a person? Kaladin\u2019s skin was sliced in a hundred places, dribbles of blood mixing with rainwater running down the side of the building. The lad\u2019s body still hung by the ankles. His shirt had been ripped off; his bridgeman trousers were ragged. Ironically, his face was cleaner now than when they\u2019d left him, washed by the storm.\r\nTeft had seen enough dead men on the battlefield to know what he was looking at.\r\nPoor lad,he thought, shaking his head as the rest of Bridge Four gathered around him and Rock, quiet, horrified.\r\nYou almost made me believe in you.\r\nKaladin\u2019s eyes snapped open.\r\nThe gathered bridgemen gasped, several cursing and falling to the ground, splashing in the pools of rainwater. Kaladin drew in a ragged breath, wheezing, eyes staring forward, intense and unseeing. He exhaled, blowing flecks of bloody spittle out over his lips. His hand, hanging below him, slipped open.\r\nSomething dropped to the stones. The sphere Teft had given him. It splashed into a puddle and stopped there. It was dun, no Stormlight in it.\r\nWhat in the name of Kelek?Teft thought, kneeling. You left a sphere out in the storm, and it gathered Stormlight. Held in Kaladin\u2019s hand, this one should have been fully infused. What had gone wrong?\r\n\u201C\r\nUmalakai\u2019ki!\u201D Rock bellowed, pointing. \u201C\r\nKama mohoray namavau\u2014\u201D He stopped, realizing he was speaking the wrong language. \u201CSomebody be helping me get him down! Is still alive! We need ladder and knife! Hurry!\u201D\r\nThe bridgemen scrambled. The soldiers approached, muttering, but they didn\u2019t stop the bridgemen. Sadeas himself had declared that the Stormfather would choose Kaladin\u2019s fate. Everyone knew that meant death.\r\nExcept\u2026Teft stood up straight, holding the dun sphere.\r\nAn empty sphere after a storm,he thought.\r\nAnd a man who\u2019s still alive when he should be dead. Two impossibilities.\r\nTogether they bespoke something that should be even\r\nmoreimpossible.\r\n\u201CWhere\u2019s that ladder!\u201D Teft found himself yelling. \u201CCurse you all, hurry, hurry! We need to get him bandaged. Somebody go fetch that salve he always puts on wounds!\u201D\r\nHe glanced back at Kaladin, then spoke much more softly. \u201CAnd you\u2019d\r\nbettersurvive, son. Because I want some answers.\u201D"

      "ChapterName": "36: THE LESSON",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\n\u201CTaking the Dawnshard, known to bind any creature voidish or mortal, he crawled up the steps crafted for Heralds, ten strides tall apiece, toward the grand temple above.\u201D\r\n\u2014From\r\nThe Poem of Ista. I have found no modern explanation of what these \u201CDawnshards\u201D are. They seem ignored by scholars, though talk of them was obviously prevalent among those recording the early mythologies.\r\nIt was not uncommon for us to meet native peoples while traveling through the Unclaimed Hills,Shallan read.\r\nThese ancient lands were once one of the Silver Kingdoms, after all. One must wonder if the great-shelled beasts lived among them back then, or if the creatures have come to inhabit the wilderness left by humankind\u2019s passing.\r\nShe settled back in her chair, the humid air warm around her. To her left, Jasnah Kholin floated quietly in the pool inset in the floor of the bathing chamber. Jasnah liked to soak in the bath, and Shallan couldn\u2019t blame her. During most of Shallan\u2019s life, bathing had been an ordeal involving dozens of parshmen carting heated buckets of water, followed by a quick scrub in the brass tub before the water cooled.\r\nKharbranth\u2019s palace offered far more luxury. The stone pool in the ground resembled a small personal lake, luxuriously warmed by clever fabrials that produced heat. Shallan didn\u2019t know much about fabrials yet, though part of her was very intrigued. This type was becoming increasingly common. Just the other day, the Conclave staff had sent Jasnah one to heat her chambers.\r\nThe water didn\u2019t have to be carried in but came out of pipes. At the turn of a lever, water flowed in. It was warm when it entered, and was kept heated by the fabrials set into the sides of the pool. Shallan had bathed in the chamber herself, and it was absolutely marvelous.\r\nThe practical decor was of rock decorated with small colorful stones set in mortar up the sides of the walls. Shallan sat beside the pool, fully dressed, reading as she waited on Jasnah\u2019s needs. The book was Gavilar\u2019s account\u2014as spoken to Jasnah herself years ago\u2014after his first meeting with the strange parshmen later known as the Parshendi.\r\nOccasionally, during our explorations, we\u2019d meet with natives,she read.\r\nNot parshmen. Natan people, with their pale bluish skin, wide noses, and wool-like white hair. In exchange for gifts of food, they would point us to the hunting grounds of greatshells.\r\nThen we met the parshmen. I\u2019d been on a half-dozen expeditions to Natanatan, but never had I seen anything like this! Parshmen, living on their own? All logic, experience, and science declared that to be an impossibility. Parshmen need the hand of civilized peoples to guide them. This has been proven time and time again. Leave one out in the wilderness, and it will just sit there, doing nothing, until someone comes along to give it orders.\r\nYet here was a group who could hunt, make weapons, build buildings, and\u2014indeed\u2014create their own civilization. We soon realized that this single discovery could expand, perhaps overthrow, all we understood about our gentle servants.\r\nShallan moved her eyes down to the bottom of the page where\u2014separated by a line\u2014the undertext was written in a small, cramped script. Most books dictated by men had an undertext, notes added by the woman or ardent who scribed the book. By unspoken agreement, the undertext was never shared out loud. Here, a wife would sometimes clarify\u2014or even contradict\u2014the account of her husband. The only way to preserve such honesty for future scholars was to maintain the sanctity and secrecy of the writing.\r\nIt should be noted,Jasnah had written in the undertext to this passage,\r\nthat I have adapted my father\u2019s words\u2014by his own instruction\u2014to make them more appropriate for recording.That meant she made his dictation sound more scholarly and impressive.\r\nIn addition, by most accounts, King Gavilar originally ignored these strange, self-sufficient parshmen. It was only after explanation by his scholars and scribes that he understood the import of what he\u2019d discovered. This inclusion is not meant to highlight my father\u2019s ignorance; he was, and is, a warrior. His attention was not on the anthropological import of our expedition, but upon the hunt that was to be its culmination.\r\nShallan closed the cover, thoughtful. The volume was from Jasnah\u2019s own collection\u2014the Palanaeum had several copies, but Shallan wasn\u2019t allowed to bring the Palanaeum\u2019s books into a bathing chamber.\r\nJasnah\u2019s clothing lay on a bench at the side of the room. Atop the folded garments, a small golden pouch held the Soulcaster. Shallan glanced at Jasnah. The princess floated face-up in the pool, black hair fanning out behind her in the water, her eyes closed. Her daily bath was the one time she seemed to relax completely. She looked much younger now, stripped of both clothing and intensity, floating like a child resting after a day of active swimming.\r\nThirty-four years old. That seemed ancient in some regards\u2014some women Jasnah\u2019s age had children as old as Shallan. And yet it was also young. Young enough that Jasnah was praised for her beauty, young enough that men declared it a shame she wasn\u2019t yet married.\r\nShallan glanced at the pile of clothing. She carried the broken fabrial in her safepouch. She could swap them here and now. It was the opportunity she\u2019d been waiting for. Jasnah now trusted her enough to relax, soaking in the bathing chamber without worrying about her fabrial.\r\nCould Shallan really do it? Could she betray this woman who had taken her in?\r\nConsidering what I\u2019ve done before,she thought,\r\nthis is nothing.It wouldn\u2019t be the first time she betrayed someone who trusted her.\r\nShe stood up. To the side, Jasnah cracked an eye.\r\nBlast,Shallan thought, tucking the book under her arm, pacing, trying to look thoughtful. Jasnah watched her. Not suspiciously. Curiously.\r\n\u201CWhy did your father want to make a treaty with the Parshendi?\u201D Shallan found herself asking as she walked.\r\n\u201CWhy wouldn\u2019t he want to?\u201D\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s not an answer.\u201D\r\n\u201COf course it is. It\u2019s just not one that tells you anything.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt would help, Brightness, if you would give me a\r\nusefulanswer.\u201D\r\n\u201CThen ask a useful question.\u201D\r\nShallan set her jaw. \u201CWhat did the Parshendi have that King Gavilar wanted?\u201D\r\nJasnah smiled, closing her eyes again. \u201CCloser. But you can probably guess the answer to that.\u201D\r\n\u201CShards.\u201D\r\nJasnah nodded, still relaxed in the water.\r\n\u201CThe text doesn\u2019t mention them,\u201D Shallan said.\r\n\u201CMy father didn\u2019t speak of them,\u201D Jasnah said. \u201CBut from things he said\u2026well, I now suspect that they motivated the treaty.\u201D\r\n\u201CCan you be sure he knew, though? Maybe he just wanted the gemhearts.\u201D\r\n\u201CPerhaps,\u201D Jasnah said. \u201CThe Parshendi seemed amused at our interest in the gemstones woven into their beards.\u201D She smiled. \u201CYou should have seen our shock when we discovered where they\u2019d gotten them. When the lanceryn died off during the scouring of Aimia, we thought we\u2019d seen the last gemhearts of large size. And yet here was another great-shelled beast with them, living in a land not too distant from Kholinar itself.\r\n\u201CAnyway, the Parshendi were willing to share them with us, so long as they could still hunt them too. To them, if you took the trouble to hunt the chasmfiends, their gemhearts were yours. I doubt a treaty would have been needed for that. And yet, just before leaving to return to Alethkar, my father suddenly began talking fervently of the need for an agreement.\u201D\r\n\u201CSo what happened? What changed?\u201D\r\n\u201CI can\u2019t be certain. However, he once described the strange actions of a Parshendi warrior during a chasmfiend hunt. Instead of reaching for his spear when the greatshell appeared, this man held his hand to the side in a very suspicious way. Only my father saw it; I suspected he believed the man planned to summon a Blade. The Parshendi realized what he was doing, and stopped himself. My father didn\u2019t speak of it further, and I assume he didn\u2019t want the world\u2019s eyes on the Shattered Plains any more than they already were.\u201D\r\nShallan tapped her book. \u201CIt seems tenuous. If he was sure about the Blades, he must have seen more.\u201D\r\n\u201CI suspect so as well. But I studied the treaty carefully, after his death. The clauses for favored trade status and mutual border crossing could very well have been a step toward folding the Parshendi into Alethkar as a nation. It certainly would have prevented the Parshendi from trading their Shards to other kingdoms without coming to us first. Perhaps that was all he wanted to do.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut why kill him?\u201D Shallan said, arms crossed, strolling in the direction of Jasnah\u2019s folded clothing. \u201CDid the Parshendi realize that he intended to have their Shardblades, and so struck at him preemptively?\u201D\r\n\u201CUncertain,\u201D Jasnah said. She sounded skeptical. Why did\r\nshethink the Parshendi killed Gavilar? Shallan nearly asked, but she had a feeling she wouldn\u2019t get any more out of Jasnah. The woman expected Shallan to think, discover, and draw conclusions on her own.\r\nShallan stopped beside the bench. The pouch holding the Soulcaster was open, the drawstrings loose. She could see the precious artifact curled up inside. The swap would be easy. She had used a large chunk of her money to buy gemstones that matched Jasnah\u2019s, and had put them into the broken Soulcaster. The two were now exactly identical.\r\nShe still hadn\u2019t learned anything about using the fabrial; she\u2019d tried to find a way to ask, but Jasnah avoided speaking of the Soulcaster. Pushing harder would be suspicious. Shallan would have to get information elsewhere. Perhaps from Kabsal, or maybe from a book in the Palanaeum.\r\nRegardless, the time was upon her. Shallan found her hand going to her safepouch, and she felt inside of it, running her fingers along the chains of her broken fabrial. Her heart beat faster. She glanced at Jasnah, but the woman was just lying there, floating, eyes closed. What if she opened her eyes?\r\nDon\u2019t think of that!Shallan told herself.\r\nJust do it. Make the swap. It\u2019s so close\u2026.\r\n\u201CYou are progressing more quickly than I had assumed you would,\u201D Jasnah said suddenly.\r\nShallan spun, but Jasnah\u2019s eyes were still closed. \u201CI was wrong to judge you so harshly because of your prior education. I myself have often said that passion outperforms upbringing. You have the determination and the capacity to become a respected scholar, Shallan. I realize that the answers seem slow in coming, but continue your research. You will have them eventually.\u201D\r\nShallan stood for a moment, hand in her pouch, heart thumping uncontrollably. She felt sick.\r\nI can\u2019t do it,she realized.\r\nStormfather, but I\u2019m a fool. I came all of this way\u2026and now I can\u2019t do it!\r\nShe pulled her hand from her pouch and stalked back across the bathing chamber to her chair. What was she going to tell her brothers? Had she just doomed her family? She sat down, setting her book aside and sighing, prompting Jasnah to open her eyes. Jasnah watched her, then righted herself in the water and gestured for the hairsoap.\r\nGritting her teeth, Shallan stood up and fetched the soap tray for Jasnah, bringing it over and squatting down to proffer it. Jasnah took the powdery hairsoap and mashed it in her hand, lathering it before putting it into her sleek black hair with both hands. Even naked, Jasnah Kholin was composed and in control.\r\n\u201CPerhaps we have spent too much time indoors of late,\u201D the princess said. \u201CYou look penned up, Shallan. Anxious.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m fine,\u201D Shallan said brusquely.\r\n\u201CHum, yes. As evidenced by your perfectly reasonable, relaxed tone. Perhaps we need to shift some of your training from history to something more hands-on, more visceral.\u201D\r\n\u201CLike natural science?\u201D Shallan asked, perking up.\r\nJasnah tilted her head back. Shallan knelt down on a towel beside the pool, then reached down with her freehand, massaging the soap into her mistress\u2019s lush tresses.\r\n\u201CI was thinking philosophy,\u201D Jasnah said.\r\nShallan blinked. \u201CPhilosophy? What good is that?\u201D\r\nIsn\u2019t it the art of saying nothing with as many words as possible?\r\n\u201CPhilosophy is an important field of study,\u201D Jasnah said sternly. \u201CParticularly if you\u2019re going to be involved in court politics. The nature of morality must be considered, and preferably before one is exposed to situations where a moral decision is required.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes, Brightness. Though I fail to see how philosophy is more \u2018hands-on\u2019 than history.\u201D\r\n\u201CHistory, by definition, cannot be experienced directly. As it is happening, it is the present, and that is philosophy\u2019s realm.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s just a matter of definition.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D Jasnah said, \u201Call words have a tendency to be subject to how they are defined.\u201D\r\n\u201CI suppose,\u201D Shallan said, leaning back, letting Jasnah dunk her hair to clean off the soap.\r\nThe princess began scrubbing her skin with mildly abrasive soap. \u201CThat was a particularly bland response, Shallan. What happened to your wit?\u201D\r\nShallan glanced at the bench and its precious fabrial. After all this time, she had proven too weak to do what needed to be done. \u201CMy wit is on temporary hiatus, Brightness,\u201D she said. \u201CPending review by its colleagues, sincerity and temerity.\u201D\r\nJasnah raised an eyebrow at her.\r\nShallan sat back on her heels, still kneeling on the towel. \u201CHow\r\ndoyou know what is right, Jasnah? If you don\u2019t listen to the devotaries, how do you decide?\u201D\r\n\u201CThat depends upon one\u2019s philosophy. What is most important to you?\u201D\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know. Can\u2019t you tell me?\u201D\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D Jasnah replied. \u201CIf I gave you the answers, I\u2019d be no better than the devotaries, prescribing beliefs.\u201D\r\n\u201CThey aren\u2019t evil, Jasnah.\u201D\r\n\u201CExcept when they try to rule the world.\u201D\r\nShallan drew her lips into a thin line. The War of Loss had destroyed the Hierocracy, shattering Vorinism into the devotaries. That was the inevitable result of a religion trying to rule. The devotaries were to teach morals, not enforce them. Enforcement was for the lighteyes.\r\n\u201CYou say you can\u2019t give me answers,\u201D Shallan said. \u201CBut can\u2019t I ask for the advice of someone wise? Someone who\u2019s gone before? Why write our philosophies, draw our conclusions, if not to influence others? You yourself told me that information is worthless unless we use it to make judgments.\u201D\r\nJasnah smiled, dunking her arms and washing off the soap. Shallan caught a victorious glimmer in her eye. She wasn\u2019t necessarily advocating ideas because she believed them; she just wanted to push Shallan. It was infuriating. How was Shallan to know what Jasnah really thought if she adopted conflicting points of view like this?\r\n\u201CYou act as if there were one answer,\u201D Jasnah said, gesturing to Shallan to fetch a towel and climbing from the pool. \u201CA single, eternally perfect response.\u201D\r\nShallan hastily complied, bearing a large, fluffy towel. \u201CIsn\u2019t that what philosophy is about? Finding the answers? Seeking the truth, the real meaning of things?\u201D\r\nToweling off, Jasnah raised an eyebrow at her.\r\n\u201CWhat?\u201D Shallan asked, suddenly self-conscious.\r\n\u201CI believe it is time for a field exercise,\u201D Jasnah said. \u201COutside of the Palanaeum.\u201D\r\n\u201CNow?\u201D Shallan asked. \u201CIt\u2019s so late!\u201D\r\n\u201CI told you philosophy was a hands-on art,\u201D Jasnah said, wrapping the towel around herself, then reaching down and taking the Soulcaster out of its pouch. She slipped the chains around her fingers, securing the gemstones to the back of her hand. \u201CI\u2019ll prove it to you. Come, help me dress.\u201D\r\nAs a child, Shallan had relished those evenings when she\u2019d been able to slip away into the gardens. When the blanket of darkness rested atop the\u00A0grounds, they had seemed a different place entirely. In those shadows, she\u2019d been able to imagine that the rockbuds, shalebark, and trees were some foreign fauna. The scrapings of cremlings climbing out of cracks had become the footsteps of mysterious people from far-off lands. Large-eyed traders from Shinovar, a greatshell rider from Kadrix, or a narrowboat sailor from the Purelake.\r\nShe didn\u2019t have those same imaginings when walking Kharbranth at night. Imagining dark wanderers in the night had once been an intriguing game\u2014but here, dark wanderers were likely to be real. Instead of becoming a mysterious, intriguing place at night, Kharbranth seemed much the same to her\u2014just more dangerous.\r\nJasnah ignored the calls of rickshaw pullers and palanquin porters. She walked slowly in a beautiful dress of violet and gold, Shallan following in blue silk. Jasnah hadn\u2019t taken time to have her hair done following her bath, and she wore it loose, cascading across her shoulders, almost scandalous in its freedom.\r\nThey walked the Ralinsa\u2014the main thoroughfare that led down the hillside in switchbacks, connecting Conclave and port. Despite the late hour, the roadway was crowded, and many of the men who walked here seemed to bear the night inside of them. They were gruffer, more shadowed of face. Shouts still rang through the city, but those carried the night in them too, measured by the roughness of their words and the sharpness of their tones. The steep, slanted hillside that formed the city was no less crowded with buildings than always, yet these too seemed to draw in the night. Blackened, like stones burned by a fire. Hollow remains.\r\nThe bells still rang. In the darkness, each ring was a tiny scream. They made the wind more present, a living thing that caused a chiming cacophony each time it passed. A breeze rose, and an avalanche of sound came tumbling across the Ralinsa. Shallan nearly found herself ducking before it.\r\n\u201CBrightness,\u201D Shallan said. \u201CShouldn\u2019t we call for a palanquin?\u201D\r\n\u201CA palanquin might inhibit the lesson.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll be all right learning that lesson during the day, if you wouldn\u2019t mind.\u201D\r\nJasnah stopped, looking off the Ralinsa and toward a darker side street. \u201CWhat do you think of that roadway, Shallan?\u201D\r\n\u201CIt doesn\u2019t look particularly appealing to me.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd yet,\u201D Jasnah said, \u201Cit is the most direct route from the Ralinsa to the theater district.\u201D\r\n\u201CIs that where we\u2019re going?\u201D\r\n\u201CWe aren\u2019t \u2018going\u2019 anywhere,\u201D Jasnah said, taking off down the side street. \u201CWe are acting, pondering, and learning.\u201D\r\nShallan followed nervously. The night swallowed them; only the occasional light from late-night taverns and shops offered illumination. Jasnah wore her black, fingerless glove over her Soulcaster, hiding the light of its gemstones.\r\nShallan found herself creeping. Her slippered feet could feel every change in the ground underfoot, each pebble and crack. She looked about nervously as they passed a group of workers gathered around a tavern doorway. They were darkeyes, of course. In the night, that distinction seemed more profound.\r\n\u201CBrightness?\u201D Shallan asked in a hushed tone.\r\n\u201CWhen we are young,\u201D Jasnah said, \u201Cwe want simple answers. There is no greater indication of youth, perhaps, than the desire for everything to be\r\nas it should. As it has ever been.\u201D\r\nShallan frowned, still watching the men by the tavern over her shoulder.\r\n\u201CThe older we grow,\u201D Jasnah said, \u201Cthe more we question. We begin to ask why. And yet, we still want the answers to be simple. We assume that the people around us\u2014adults, leaders\u2014will have those answers. Whatever they give often satisfies us.\u201D\r\n\u201CI was never satisfied,\u201D Shallan said softly. \u201CI wanted more.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou were mature,\u201D Jasnah said. \u201CWhat you describe happens to most of us, as we age. Indeed, it seems to me that aging, wisdom, and\r\nwonderingare synonymous. The older we grow, the more likely we are to reject the simple answers. Unless someone gets in our way and demands they be accepted regardless.\u201D Jasnah\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201CYou wonder why I reject the devotaries.\u201D\r\n\u201CI do.\u201D\r\n\u201CMost of them seek to stop the questions.\u201D Jasnah halted. Then she briefly pulled back her glove, using the light beneath to reveal the street around her. The gemstones on her hand\u2014larger than broams\u2014blazed like torches, red, white, and grey.\r\n\u201CIs it wise to be showing your wealth like that, Brightness?\u201D Shallan said, speaking very softly and glancing about her.\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D Jasnah said. \u201CIt is most certainly not. Particularly not here. You see, this street has gained a particular reputation lately. On three separate occasions during the last two months, theatergoers who chose this route to the main road were accosted by footpads. In each case, the people were murdered.\u201D\r\nShallan felt herself grow pale.\r\n\u201CThe city watch,\u201D Jasnah said, \u201Chas done nothing. Taravangian has sent them several pointed reprimands, but the captain of the watch is cousin to a very influential lighteyes in the city, and Taravangian is not a terribly powerful king. Some suspect that there is more going on, that the footpads might be bribing the watch. The politics of it are irrelevant at the moment for, as you can see, no members of the watch are guarding the place, despite its reputation.\u201D\r\nJasnah pulled her glove back on, plunging the roadway back into darkness. Shallan blinked, her eyes adjusting.\r\n\u201CHow foolish,\u201D Jasnah said, \u201Cwould you say it is for us to come here, two undefended women wearing costly clothing and bearing riches?\u201D\r\n\u201C\r\nVeryfoolish. Jasnah, can we go? Please. Whatever lesson you have in mind isn\u2019t worth this.\u201D\r\nJasnah drew her lips into a line, then looked toward a narrow, darker alleyway off the road they were on. It was almost completely black now that Jasnah had replaced her glove.\r\n\u201CYou\u2019re at an interesting place in your life, Shallan,\u201D Jasnah said, flexing her hand. \u201CYou are old enough to wonder, to ask, to reject what is presented to you simply\r\nbecauseit was presented to you. But you also cling to the idealism of youth. You feel there must be some single, all-defining Truth\u2014and you think that once you find it, all that once confused you will suddenly make sense.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2026\u201D Shallan wanted to argue, but Jasnah\u2019s words were tellingly accurate. The terrible things Shallan had done, the terrible thing she had planned to do, haunted her. Was it possible to do something horrible in the name of accomplishing something wonderful?\r\nJasnah walked into the narrow alleyway.\r\n\u201CJasnah!\u201D Shallan said. \u201CWhat are you doing?\u201D\r\n\u201CThis is philosophy in action, child,\u201D Jasnah said. \u201CCome with me.\u201D\r\nShallan hesitated at the mouth of the alleyway, her heart thumping, her thoughts muddled. The wind blew and bells rang, like frozen raindrops shattering against the stones. In a moment of decision, she rushed after Jasnah, preferring company, even in the dark, to being alone. The shrouded glimmer of the Soulcaster was barely enough to light their way, and Shallan followed in Jasnah\u2019s shadow.\r\nNoise from behind. Shallan turned with a start to see several dark forms crowding into the alley. \u201COh, Stormfather,\u201D she whispered. Why? Why was Jasnah doing this?\r\nShaking, Shallan grabbed at Jasnah\u2019s dress with her freehand. Other shadows were moving in front of them, from the far side of the alley. They grew closer, grunting, splashing through foul, stagnant puddles. Chill water had already soaked Shallan\u2019s slippers.\r\nJasnah stopped moving. The frail light of her cloaked Soulcaster reflected off metal in the hands of their stalkers. Swords or knives.\r\nThese men meant murder. You didn\u2019t rob women like Shallan and Jasnah, women with powerful connections, then leave them alive as witnesses. Men like these were not the gentlemen bandits of romantic stories. They lived each day knowing that if they were caught, they would be hanged.\r\nParalyzed by fear, Shallan couldn\u2019t even scream.\r\nStormfather, Stormfather, Stormfather!\r\n\u201CAnd now,\u201D Jasnah said, voice hard and grim, \u201Cthe lesson.\u201D She whipped off her glove.\r\nThe sudden light was nearly blinding. Shallan raised a hand against it, stumbling back against the alley wall. There were four men around them. Not the men from the tavern entrance, but others. Men she hadn\u2019t noticed watching them. She could see the knives now, and she could also see the murder in their eyes.\r\nHer scream finally broke free.\r\nThe men grunted at the glare, but shoved their way forward. A thick-chested man with a dark beard came up to Jasnah, weapon raised. She calmly reached her hand out\u2014fingers splayed\u2014and pressed it against his chest as he swung a knife. Shallan\u2019s breath caught in her throat.\r\nJasnah\u2019s hand sank into the man\u2019s skin, and he froze. A second later he burned.\r\nNo, he\r\nbecame fire. Transformed into flames in an eyeblink. Rising around Jasnah\u2019s hand, they formed the outline of a man with head thrown back and mouth open. For just a moment, the blaze of the man\u2019s death outshone Jasnah\u2019s gemstones.\r\nShallan\u2019s scream trailed off. The figure of flames was strangely beautiful. It was gone in a moment, the fire dissipating into the night air, leaving an orange afterimage in Shallan\u2019s eyes.\r\nThe other three men began to curse, scrambling away, tripping over one another in their panic. One fell. Jasnah turned casually, brushing his shoulder with her fingers as he struggled to his knees. He became crystal, a figure of pure, flawless quartz\u2014his clothing transformed along with him. The diamond in Jasnah\u2019s Soulcaster faded, but there was still plenty of Stormlight left to send rainbow sparkles through the transformed corpse.\r\nThe other two men fled in opposite directions. Jasnah took a deep breath, closing her eyes, lifting her hand above her head. Shallan held her safehand to her breast, stunned, confused. Terrified.\r\nStormlight shot from Jasnah\u2019s hand like twin bolts of lightning, symmetrical. One struck each of the footpads and they popped, puffing into smoke. Their empty clothing dropped to the ground. With a sharp snap, the smokestone crystal on Jasnah\u2019s Soulcaster cracked, its light vanishing, leaving her with just the diamond and the ruby.\r\nThe remains of the two footpads rose into the air, small billows of greasy vapor. Jasnah opened her eyes, looking eerily calm. She tugged her glove back on\u2014using her safehand to hold it against her stomach and sliding her freehand fingers in. Then she calmly walked back the way they had come. She left the crystal corpse kneeling with hand upraised. Frozen forever.\r\nShallan pried herself off the wall and hastened after Jasnah, sickened and amazed. Ardents were forbidden to use their Soulcasters on people. They rarely even used them in front of others. And how had Jasnah struck down two men at a distance? From everything Shallan had read\u2014what little there was to find\u2014Soulcasting required physical contact.\r\nToo overwhelmed to demand answers, she stood silent\u2014freehand held to the side of her head, trying to control her trembling and her gasping breaths\u2014as Jasnah called for a palanquin. One came eventually, and the two women climbed in.\r\nThe bearers carried them toward the Ralinsa, their steps jostling Shallan and Jasnah, who sat across from one another in the palanquin. Jasnah idly popped the broken smokestone from her Soulcaster, then tucked it into a pocket. It could be sold to a gemsmith, who could cut smaller gemstones from the salvaged pieces.\r\n\u201CThat was horrible,\u201D Shallan finally said, hand still held to her breast. \u201CIt was one of the most awful things I\u2019ve ever experienced. You\r\nkilledfour men.\u201D\r\n\u201CFour men who were planning to beat, rob, kill, and possibly rape us.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou tempted them into coming for us!\u201D\r\n\u201CDid I force them to commit any crimes?\u201D\r\n\u201CYou showed off your gemstones.\u201D\r\n\u201CCan a woman not walk with her possessions down the street of a city?\u201D\r\n\u201CAt night?\u201D Shallan asked. \u201CThrough a rough area? Displaying wealth? You all but asked for what happened!\u201D\r\n\u201CDoes that make it right?\u201D Jasnah said, leaning forward. \u201CDo you condone what the men were planning to do?\u201D\r\n\u201COf course not. But that doesn\u2019t make what you did right either!\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd yet, those men are off the street. The people of this city are that much safer. The issue that Taravangian has been so worried about has been solved, and no more theatergoers will fall to those thugs. How many lives did I just save?\u201D\r\n\u201CI know how many you just took,\u201D Shallan said. \u201CAnd through the power of something that should be holy!\u201D\r\n\u201CPhilosophy in action. An important lesson for you.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou did all this just to prove a point,\u201D Shallan said softly. \u201CYou did this to\r\nproveto me that you could. Damnation, Jasnah, how could you\r\ndosomething like that?\u201D\r\nJasnah didn\u2019t reply. Shallan stared at the woman, searching for emotion in those expressionless eyes.\r\nStormfather. Did I ever really know this woman? Who is she, really?\r\nJasnah leaned back, watching the city pass. \u201CI did\r\nnotdo this just to prove a point, child. I have been feeling for some time that I took advantage of His Majesty\u2019s hospitality. He doesn\u2019t realize how much trouble he could face for allying himself with me. Besides, men like those\u2026\u201D There was something in her voice, an edge Shallan had never heard before.\r\nWhat was done to you?Shallan wondered with horror.\r\nAnd who did it?\r\n\u201CRegardless,\u201D Jasnah continued, \u201Ctonight\u2019s actions came about because I chose this path, not because of anything I felt you needed to see. However, the opportunity also presented a chance for instruction, for questions. Am I a monster or am I a hero? Did I just slaughter four men, or did I stop four murderers from walking the streets? Does one\r\ndeserveto have evil done to her by consequence of putting herself where evil can reach her? Did I have a right to defend myself? Or was I just looking for an excuse to end lives?\u201D\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know,\u201D Shallan whispered.\r\n\u201CYou will spend the next week researching it and thinking on it. If you wish to be a scholar\u2014a\r\ntruescholar who changes the world\u2014then you will need to face questions like this. There will be times when you must make decisions that churn your stomach, Shallan Davar. I\u2019ll have you ready to make those decisions.\u201D\r\nJasnah fell silent, looking out the side as the palanquin bearers marched them up to the Conclave. Too troubled to say more, Shallan suffered the rest of the trip in silence. She followed Jasnah through the hushed hallways to their rooms, passing scholars on their way to the Palanaeum for some midnight study.\r\nInside their rooms, Shallan helped Jasnah undress, though she hated touching the woman. She shouldn\u2019t have felt that way. The men Jasnah had killed were terrible creatures, and she had little doubt that they would have killed her. But it wasn\u2019t the act itself so much as the cold callousness of it that bothered her.\r\nStill feeling numb, Shallan fetched Jasnah a sleeping robe as the woman removed her jewelry and set it on the dressing table. \u201CYou could have let the other three get away,\u201D Shallan said, walking back toward Jasnah, who had sat down to brush her hair. \u201CYou only needed to kill one of them.\u201D\r\n\u201CNo, I didn\u2019t,\u201D Jasnah said.\r\n\u201CWhy? They would have been too frightened to do something like that again.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou don\u2019t know that. I sincerely wanted those men\r\ngone. A careless barmaid walking home the wrong way cannot protect herself, but I can. And I will.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou have no authority to do so, not in someone else\u2019s city.\u201D\r\n\u201CTrue,\u201D Jasnah said. \u201CAnother point to consider, I suppose.\u201D She raised the brush to her hair, pointedly turning away from Shallan. She closed her eyes, as if to shut Shallan out.\r\nThe Soulcaster sat on the dressing table beside Jasnah\u2019s earrings. Shallan gritted her teeth, holding the soft, silken robe. Jasnah sat in her white underdress, brushing her hair.\r\nThere will be times when you must make decisions that churn your stomach, Shallan Davar\u2026.\r\nI\u2019ve faced them already.\r\nI\u2019m facing one now.\r\nHow\r\ndareJasnah do this? How\r\ndareshe make Shallan a part of it? How\r\ndareshe use something beautiful and holy as a device for destruction?\r\nJasnah didn\u2019t deserve to own the Soulcaster.\r\nWith a swift move of her hand, Shallan tucked the folded robe under her safearm, then shoved her hand into her safepouch and popped out the intact smokestone from her father\u2019s Soulcaster. She stepped up to the dressing table, and\u2014using the motion of placing the robe onto the table as a cover\u2014made the exchange. She slid the working Soulcaster into her safehand within its sleeve, stepping back as Jasnah opened her eyes and glanced at the robe, which now sat innocently beside the nonfunctional Soulcaster.\r\nShallan\u2019s breath caught in her throat.\r\nJasnah closed her eyes again, handing the brush toward Shallan. \u201CFifty strokes tonight, Shallan. It has been a fatiguing day.\u201D\r\nShallan moved by rote, brushing her mistress\u2019s hair while clutching the stolen Soulcaster in her hidden safehand, panicked that Jasnah would notice the swap at any moment.\r\nShe didn\u2019t. Not when she put on her robe. Not when she tucked the broken Soulcaster away in her jewelry case and locked it with a key she wore around her neck as she slept.\r\nShallan walked from the room stunned, in turmoil. Exhausted, sickened, confused.\r\nBut undiscovered."

      "ChapterName": "37: SIDES",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\nFIVE AND A HALF YEARS AGO\r\n\u201CKaladin, look at this rock,\u201D Tien said. \u201CIt changes colors when you look at it from different sides.\u201D\r\nKal looked away from the window, glancing at his brother. Now thirteen years of age, Tien had turned from an eager boy into an eager adolescent. Though he\u2019d grown, he was still small for his age, and his mop of black and brown hair still refused all attempts at order. He was squatting beside the lacquered cobwood dinner table, eyes level with the glossy surface, looking at a small, lumpish rock.\r\nKal sat on a stool peeling longroots with a short knife. The brown roots were dirty on the outside and sticky when he sliced into them, so working on them coated his fingers with a thick layer of crem. He finished a root and handed it up to his mother, who washed it off and sliced it into the stew pot.\r\n\u201CMother, look at this,\u201D Tien said. Late-afternoon sunlight streamed through the leeside window, bathing the table. \u201CFrom this side, the rock sparkles red, but from the other side, it\u2019s green.\u201D\r\n\u201CPerhaps it\u2019s magical,\u201D Hesina said. Chunk after chunk of longroot plunked into the water, each splash with a slightly different note.\r\n\u201CI think it must be,\u201D Tien said. \u201COr it has a spren. Do spren live in rocks?\u201D\r\n\u201CSpren live in everything,\u201D Hesina replied.\r\n\u201CThey can\u2019t live in\r\neverything,\u201D Kal said, dropping a peel into the pail at his feet. He glanced out the window, watching the road that led from the town to the citylord\u2019s mansion.\r\n\u201CThey do,\u201D Hesina said. \u201CSpren appear when something changes\u2014when fear appears, or when it begins to rain. They are the heart of change, and therefore the heart of all things.\u201D\r\n\u201CThis longroot,\u201D Kal said, holding it up skeptically.\r\n\u201CHas a spren.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd if you slice it up?\u201D\r\n\u201CEach bit has a spren. Only smaller.\u201D\r\nKal frowned, looking over the long tuber. They grew in cracks in the stone where water collected. They tasted faintly of minerals, but were easy to grow. His family needed food that didn\u2019t cost much, these days.\r\n\u201CSo we eat spren,\u201D Kal said flatly.\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D she said, \u201Cwe eat the roots.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhen we\r\nhaveto,\u201D Tien added with a grimace.\r\n\u201CAnd the spren?\u201D Kal pressed.\r\n\u201CThey are freed. To return to wherever it is that spren live.\u201D\r\n\u201CDo I have a spren?\u201D Tien said, looking down at his chest.\r\n\u201CYou have a soul, dear. You\u2019re a person. But the pieces of your body may very well have spren living in them. Very small ones.\u201D\r\nTien pinched at his skin, as if trying to pry the tiny spren out.\r\n\u201CDung,\u201D Kal said suddenly.\r\n\u201CKal!\u201D Hesina snapped. \u201CThat\u2019s not talk for mealtime.\u201D\r\n\u201CDung,\u201D Kal said stubbornly. \u201CIt has spren?\u201D\r\n\u201CI suppose it does.\u201D\r\n\u201CDungspren,\u201D Tien said, then snickered.\r\nHis mother continued to chop. \u201CWhy all of these questions, suddenly?\u201D\r\nKal shrugged. \u201CI just\u2014I don\u2019t know. Because.\u201D\r\nHe\u2019d been thinking recently about the way the world worked, about what he was to do with his place in it. The other boys his age, they didn\u2019t wonder about their place. Most\r\nknewwhat their future held. Working in the fields.\r\nKal had a choice, though. Over the last several months, he\u2019d finally made that choice. He would become a soldier. He was fifteen now, and could volunteer when the next recruiter came through town. He planned to do just that. No more wavering. He would learn to fight. That was the end of it. Wasn\u2019t it?\r\n\u201CI want to understand,\u201D he said. \u201CI just want everything to make sense.\u201D\r\nHis mother smiled at that, standing in her brown work dress, hair pulled back in a tail, the top hidden beneath her yellow kerchief.\r\n\u201CWhat?\u201D he demanded. \u201CWhy are you smiling?\u201D\r\n\u201CYou\r\njustwant everything to make sense?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes.\u201D\r\n\u201CWell next time the ardents come through the town to burn prayers and Elevate people\u2019s Callings, I\u2019ll pass the message along.\u201D She smiled. \u201CUntil then, keep peeling roots.\u201D\r\nKal sighed, but did as she told him. He checked out the window again, and nearly dropped the root in shock. The carriage. It was coming down the roadway from the mansion. He felt a flutter of nervous hesitation. He\u2019d planned, he\u2019d thought, but now that the time was upon him, he wanted to sit and keep peeling. There would be another opportunity, surely\u2026.\r\nNo. He stood, trying to keep the anxiety from his voice. \u201CI\u2019m going to go rinse off.\u201D He held up crem-covered fingers.\r\n\u201CYou should have washed the roots off first as I told you,\u201D his mother noted.\r\n\u201CI know,\u201D Kal said. Did his sigh of regret sound fake? \u201CMaybe I\u2019ll just wash them all off now.\u201D\r\nHesina said nothing as he gathered up the remaining roots, crossed to the door, heart thumping, and stepped out into the evening light.\r\n\u201CSee,\u201D Tien said from behind, \u201Cfrom this side it\u2019s green. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a spren, Mother. It\u2019s the light. It makes the rock change\u2026.\u201D\r\nThe door swung closed. Kal set down the tubers and charged through the streets of Hearthstone, passing men chopping wood, women throwing out dishwater, and a group of grandfathers sitting on steps and looking at the sunset. He dunked his hands into a rain barrel, but didn\u2019t stop as he shook the water free. He ran around Mabrow Pigherder\u2019s house, up past the commonwater\u2014the large hole cut into the rock at the center of the town to catch rain\u2014and along the breakwall, the steep hillside against which the town was built to shield it from storms.\r\nHere, he found a small stand of stumpweight trees. Knobby and about as tall as a man, they grew leaves only on their leeward sides, running down the length of the tree like rungs on a ladder, waving in the cool breeze. As Kal got close, the large, bannerlike leaves snapped up close to the trunks, making a series of whipping sounds.\r\nKal\u2019s father stood on the other side, hands clasped behind his back. He was waiting where the road from the manor turned past Hearthstone. Lirin turned with a start, noticing Kal. He wore his finest clothing: a blue coat, buttoning up the sides, like a lighteyes\u2019s coat. But it was over a pair of white trousers that showed wear. He studied Kal through his spectacles.\r\n\u201CI\u2019m going with you,\u201D Kal blurted. \u201CUp to the mansion.\u201D\r\n\u201CHow did you know?\r\n\u201CEveryone knows,\u201D Kal said. \u201CYou think they wouldn\u2019t talk if Brightlord Roshone invited you to dinner? You, of all people?\u201D\r\nLirin looked away. \u201CI told your mother to keep you busy.\u201D\r\n\u201CShe tried.\u201D Kal grimaced. \u201CI\u2019ll probably hear a storm of it when she finds those longroots sitting outside the front door.\u201D\r\nLirin said nothing. The carriage rolled to a stop nearby, wheels grinding against the stone.\r\n\u201CThis will not be a pleasant, idle meal, Kal,\u201D Lirin said.\r\n\u201CI\u2019m not a fool, Father.\u201D When Hesina had been told there was no more need for her to work in the town\u2026Well, there was a reason they\u2019d been reduced to eating longroots. \u201CIf you\u2019re going to confront him, then you should have someone to support you.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd that someone is you?\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m pretty much all you have.\u201D\r\nThe coachman cleared his throat. He didn\u2019t get down and open the door, the way he did for Brightlord Roshone.\r\nLirin eyed Kal.\r\n\u201CIf you send me back, I\u2019ll go,\u201D Kal said.\r\n\u201CNo. Come along if you must.\u201D Lirin walked up to the carriage and pulled open the door. It wasn\u2019t the fancy, gold-trimmed vehicle that Roshone used. This was the second carriage, the older brown one. Kal climbed in, feeling a surge of excitement at the small victory\u2014and an equal measure of panic.\r\nThey were going to face Roshone. Finally.\r\nThe benches inside were amazing, the red cloth covering them softer than anything Kal had ever felt. He sat down, and the seat was surprisingly springy. Lirin sat across from Kal, pulling the door closed, and the coachman snapped his whip at the horses. The vehicle turned around and rattled back up the road. As soft as the seat was, the ride was terribly bumpy, and it rattled Kal\u2019s teeth against one another. It was worse than riding in a wagon, though that was probably because they were going faster.\r\n\u201CWhy didn\u2019t you want us to know about this?\u201D Kal asked.\r\n\u201CI wasn\u2019t certain I\u2019d go.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat else would you do?\u201D\r\n\u201CMove away,\u201D Lirin said. \u201CTake you to Kharbranth and escape this town, this kingdom, and Roshone\u2019s petty grudges.\u201D\r\nKal blinked in shock. He\u2019d never thought of that. Suddenly everything seemed to expand. His future changed, wrapping upon itself, folding into a new form entirely. Father, Mother, Tien\u2026\r\nwithhim. \u201CReally?\u201D\r\nLirin nodded absently. \u201CEven if we didn\u2019t go to Kharbranth, I\u2019m sure many Alethi towns would welcome us. Most have never had a surgeon to care for them. They do the best they can with local men who learned most of what they know from superstition or working on the occasional wounded chull. We could even move to Kholinar; I\u2019m skilled enough to get work as a physician\u2019s assistant there.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhy don\u2019t we go, then? Why\r\nhaven\u2019twe gone?\u201D\r\nLirin watched out the window. \u201CI don\u2019t know. We should leave. It makes sense. We have the money. We aren\u2019t wanted here. The citylord hates us, the people mistrust us, the Stormfather himself seems inclined to knock us down.\u201D There was something in Lirin\u2019s voice. Regret?\r\n\u201CI tried very hard to leave once,\u201D Lirin said, more softly. \u201CBut there\u2019s a tie between a man\u2019s home and his heart. I\u2019ve cared for these people, Kal. Delivered their children, set their bones, healed their scrapes. You\u2019ve seen the worst of them, these last few years, but there was a time before that, a good time.\u201D He turned to Kal, clasping his hands in front of him, the carriage rattling. \u201CThey\u2019re mine, son. And I\u2019m theirs. They\u2019re my responsibility, now that Wistiow has gone. I can\u2019t leave them to Roshone.\u201D\r\n\u201CEven if they\r\nlikewhat he\u2019s doing?\u201D\r\n\u201CParticularly because of that.\u201D Lirin raised a hand to his head. \u201CStormfather. It sounds more foolish now that I say it.\u201D\r\n\u201CNo. I understand. I think.\u201D Kal shrugged. \u201CI guess, well, they still come to us when they\u2019re hurt. They complain about how unnatural it is to cut into a person, but they still come. I used to wonder why.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd did you come to a conclusion?\u201D\r\n\u201CKind of. I decided that in the end, they\u2019d rather be alive to curse at you a few more days. It\u2019s what they do. Just like healing them is what you do. And they\r\nusedto give you money. A man can say all kinds of things, but where he sets his spheres, that\u2019s where his heart is.\u201D Kal frowned. \u201CI guess they\r\ndidappreciate you.\u201D\r\nLirin smiled. \u201CWise words. I keep forgetting that you\u2019re nearly a man, Kal. When did you go and grow up on me?\u201D\r\nThat night when we were nearly robbed,Kal thought immediately.\r\nThat night when you shone light on the men outside, and showed that bravery had nothing to do with a spear held in battle.\r\n\u201CYou\u2019re wrong about one thing, though,\u201D Lirin said. \u201CYou told me that they\r\ndidappreciate me. But they still do. Oh, they grumble\u2014they\u2019ve always done that. But they also leave food for us.\u201D\r\nKal started. \u201CThey do?\u201D\r\n\u201CHow do you think we\u2019ve been eating these last four months?\u201D\r\n\u201CBut\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CThey\u2019re frightened of Roshone, so they\u2019re quiet about it. They left it for your mother when she went to clean or put it in the rain barrel when it\u2019s empty.\u201D\r\n\u201CThey tried to rob us.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd those very men were among the ones who gave us food as well.\u201D\r\nKal pondered that as the carriage arrived at the manor house. It had been a long time since he\u2019d visited the large, two-story building. It was constructed with a standard roof that sloped toward the stormward side, but was much larger. The walls were of thick white stones, and it had majestic square pillars on the leeward side.\r\nWould he see Laral here? He was embarrassed by how infrequently he thought about her these days.\r\nThe mansion\u2019s front grounds had a low stone wall covered with all kinds of exotic plants. Rockbuds lined the top, their vines draping down the outside. Clusters of a bulbous variety of shalebark grew along the inside, bursting with a variety of bright colors. Oranges, reds, yellows, and blues. Some outcroppings looked like heaps of clothing, with folds spread like fans. Others grew out like horns. Most had tendrils like threads that waved in the wind. Brightlord Roshone paid much more attention to his grounds than Wistiow had.\r\nThey walked up past the whitewashed pillars and entered between the thick wooden stormdoors. The vestibule inside had a low ceiling and was decorated with ceramics; zircon spheres gave them a pale blue cast.\r\nA tall servant in a long black coat and a bright purple cravat greeted them. He was Natir, the steward now that Miliv had died. He\u2019d been brought in from Dalilak, a large coastal city to the north.\r\nNatir led them to a dining room where Roshone sat at a long darkwood table. He\u2019d gained weight, though not enough to be called fat. He still had that grey-flecked beard, and his hair was greased back down to his collar. He wore white trousers and a tight red vest over a white shirt.\r\nHe\u2019d already begun his meal, and the spicy scents made Kal\u2019s stomach rumble. How long had it been since he\u2019d had pork? There were five different dipping sauces on the table, and Roshone\u2019s wine was a deep, crystalline orange. He ate alone, no sign of Laral or his son.\r\nThe servant gestured toward a side table set up in a room next to the dining hall. Kal\u2019s father took one look at it, then walked to Roshone\u2019s table and sat down. Roshone paused, skewer halfway to his lips, spicy brown sauce dripping to the table before him.\r\n\u201CI\u2019m of the second nahn,\u201D Lirin said, \u201Cand I have a personal invitation to dine with you. Surely you follow the precepts of rank closely enough to give me a place at your table.\u201D\r\nRoshone clenched his teeth, but did not object. Taking a deep breath, Kal sat down beside his father. Before he left to join the war on the Shattered Plains, he\r\nhadto know. Was his father a coward or a man of courage?\r\nBy the light of spheres at home, Lirin had always seemed weak. He worked in his surgery room, ignoring what the townspeople said about him. He told his son he couldn\u2019t practice with the spear and forbade him to think of going to war. Weren\u2019t those the actions of a coward? But five months ago, Kal had seen courage in him that he\u2019d never expected.\r\nAnd in the calm blue light of Roshone\u2019s palace, Lirin met the eyes of a man far above him in rank, wealth, and power. And did not flinch. How did he do it? Kal\u2019s heart thumped uncontrollably. He had to put his hands in his lap to keep them from betraying his nervousness.\r\nRoshone waved to a serving man, and within a short time, new places had been set. The periphery of the room was dark. Roshone\u2019s table was an illuminated island amid a vast black expanse.\r\nThere were bowls of water for dipping one\u2019s fingers and stiff white cloth napkins beside them. A lighteyes\u2019 meal. Kal had rarely eaten such fine food; he tried not to make a fool of himself as he hesitantly took a skewer and imitated Roshone, using his knife to slide down the bottommost chunk of meat, then raising it and biting. The meat was savory and tender, though the spices were much hotter than he was accustomed to.\r\nLirin did not eat. He rested his elbows on the table, watching the Brightlord dine.\r\n\u201CI wished to offer you the chance to eat in peace,\u201D Roshone said eventually, \u201Cbefore we talked of serious matters. But you don\u2019t seem inclined to partake of my generosity.\u201D\r\n\u201CNo.\u201D\r\n\u201CVery well,\u201D Roshone said, taking a piece of flatbread from the basket and wrapping it around his skewer, pulling off several vegetable chunks at once and eating them with the bread. \u201CThen tell me. How long do you think you can defy me? Your family is destitute.\u201D\r\n\u201CWe do just fine,\u201D Kal cut in.\r\nLirin glanced at him, but did not chastise him for speaking. \u201CMy son is correct. We can live. And if that doesn\u2019t work, we can leave. I will not bend to your will, Roshone.\u201D\r\n\u201CIf you left,\u201D Roshone said, holding up a finger, \u201CI would contact your new citylord and tell him of the spheres stolen from me.\u201D\r\n\u201CI would win an inquest over that. Besides, as a surgeon, I am immune to most demands you could make.\u201D It was true; men and their apprentices who served an essential function in towns were afforded special protection, even from lighteyes. The Vorin legal code of citizenship was complex enough that Kaladin still had difficulty understanding it.\r\n\u201CYes, you would win an inquest,\u201D Roshone said. \u201CYou were so meticulous, preparing the exact right documents. You were the only one with Wistiow when he stamped them. Odd, that none of his clerks were there.\u201D\r\n\u201CThose clerks read him the documents.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd then left the room.\u201D\r\n\u201CBecause they were ordered to leave by Brightlord Wistiow. They have admitted this, I believe.\u201D\r\nRoshone shrugged. \u201CI don\u2019t need to\r\nprovethat you stole the spheres, surgeon. I simply have to continue doing as I have been. I know that your family eats scraps. How long will you continue to make them suffer for your pride?\u201D\r\n\u201CThey won\u2019t be intimidated. And neither will I.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m not asking if you\u2019re intimidated. I\u2019m asking if you\u2019re\r\nstarving.\u201D\r\n\u201CNot by any means,\u201D Lirin said, voice growing dry. \u201CIf we lack for something to eat, we can feast upon the attention you lavish upon us,\r\nBrightlord. We feel your eyes watching, hear your whispers to the townspeople. Judging from the degree of your concern with us, it would seem that\r\nyouare the one who is intimidated.\u201D\r\nRoshone fell still, skewer held limply in his hand, brilliant green eyes narrowed, lips pursed tight. In the dark, those eyes almost seemed to\r\nglow. Kal had to stop himself from cringing under the weight of that disapproving gaze. There was an air of command about lighteyes like Roshone.\r\nHe\u2019s not areal\r\nlighteyes! He\u2019s a reject. I\u2019ll see real ones eventually. Men of honor.\r\nLirin held the gaze evenly. \u201CEvery month we resist is a blow to your authority. You can\u2019t have me arrested, since I would win an inquest. You\u2019ve tried to turn the other people against me, but they know\u2014deep down\u2014that they need me.\u201D\r\nRoshone leaned forward. \u201CI do not like your little town.\u201D\r\nLirin frowned at the odd response.\r\n\u201CI do not like being treated like an\r\nexile,\u201D Roshone continued. \u201CI do not like living so far from anything\u2014everything\u2014important. And most of all, I do not like darkeyes who think themselves above their stations.\u201D\r\n\u201CI have trouble feeling sympathy for you.\u201D\r\nRoshone sneered. He looked down at his meal, as if it had lost any flavor. \u201CVery well. Let us make an\u2026accommodation. I will take nine-tenths of the spheres. You can have the rest.\u201D\r\nKal stood up indignantly. \u201CMy father will never\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CKal,\u201D Lirin cut in. \u201CI can speak for myself.\u201D\r\n\u201CSurely you won\u2019t make a deal, though.\u201D\r\nLirin didn\u2019t reply immediately. Finally, he said, \u201CGo to the kitchens, Kal. Ask them if they have some food more to your tastes.\u201D\r\n\u201CFather, no\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CGo, son.\u201D Lirin\u2019s voice was firm.\r\nWas it true? After all of this, would his father simply\r\ncapitulate? Kal felt his face grow red, and he fled the dining room. He knew the way to the kitchens. During his childhood, he\u2019d often dined there with Laral.\r\nHe left not because he was told to, but because he didn\u2019t want his father or Roshone to see his emotions: chagrin at having stood to denounce Roshone when his father planned to make a deal, humiliation that his father would\r\nconsidera deal, frustration at being banished. Kal was mortified to find himself crying. He passed a couple of Roshone\u2019s house soldiers standing at the doorway, lit only by a very low-trimmed oil lamp on the wall. Their rough features were highlighted in amber hues.\r\nKal hastened past them, turning a corner before pausing beside a plant stand, struggling with his emotions. The stand displayed an indoor vine-bud, one bred to remain open; a few conelike flowers climbed up from its vestigial shell. The lamp on the wall above it burned with a tiny, strangled light. These were the back rooms of the mansion, near the servant quarters, and spheres were not used for light here.\r\nKal leaned back, breathing in and out. He felt like one of the ten fools\u2014specifically Cabine, who acted like a child though he was adult. But what was he to think of Lirin\u2019s actions?\r\nHe wiped his eyes, then pushed his way through the swinging doors into the kitchens. Roshone still employed Wistiow\u2019s chef. Barm was a tall, slender man with dark hair that he wore braided. He walked down the line of his kitchen counter, giving instructions to his various subchefs as a couple of parshmen walked in and out through the mansion\u2019s back doors, carrying in crates of food. Barm carried a long metal spoon, which banged on a pot or pan hanging from the ceiling each time he gave an order.\r\nHe barely spared Kal a brown-eyed glance, then told one of his servants to go fetch some flatbread and fruited tallew rice. A child\u2019s meal. Kal felt even more embarrassed that Barm had known instantly why he had been sent to the kitchens.\r\nKal walked to the dining nook to wait for the food. It was a whitewashed alcove with a slate-topped table. He sat down, elbows on the stone, head on his hands.\r\nWhy did it make him so angry to think that his father might bargain away most of the spheres in exchange for safety? True, if that happened, there wouldn\u2019t be enough to send Kal to Kharbranth. But he\u2019d already decided to become a soldier. So it didn\u2019t matter. Did it?\r\nIam\r\ngoing to join the army,Kal thought.\r\nI\u2019ll run away, I\u2019ll\u2026\r\nSuddenly, that dream\u2014that plan\u2014seemed incredibly childish. It belonged to a boy who ought to eat fruited meals and deserved to be sent away when the men talked of important topics. For the first time, the thought of not training with the surgeons filled him with regret.\r\nThe door into the kitchens banged open. Roshone\u2019s son, Rillir, sauntered in, chatting with the person behind him. \u201C\u2026don\u2019t know\r\nwhyFather insists on keeping everything so dreary around here all the time. Oil lamps in the hallways? Could he be any more provincial? It would do him some real good if I could get him out on a hunt or two. We might as well get some use out of being in this remote place.\u201D\r\nRillir noticed Kal sitting there, but passed over him as one might register the presence of a stool or a shelf for wine: noting it, but otherwise ignoring it.\r\nKal\u2019s own eyes were on the person who followed Rillir. Laral. Wistiow\u2019s daughter.\r\nSo much had changed. It had been so long, and seeing her brought up old emotions. Shame, excitement. Did she know that his parents had been hoping to marry him to her? Merely seeing her again almost flustered him completely. But no. His father could look Roshone in the eyes. He could do the same with her.\r\nKal stood up and nodded to her. She glanced at him, and blushed faintly, walking in with an old nurse in tow\u2014a chaperone.\r\nWhat had happened to the Laral he\u2019d known, the girl with the loose yellow and black hair who liked climbing on rocks and running through fields? Now she was wrapped up in sleek yellow silk, a stylish lighteyed woman\u2019s dress, her neatly coiffed hair dyed black to hide the blond. Her left hand was hidden modestly in her sleeve. Laral\r\nlookedlike a lighteyes.\r\nWistiow\u2019s wealth\u2014what was left of it\u2014had gone to her. And when Roshone had been given authority over Hearthstone and granted the mansion and surrounding lands, Highprince Sadeas had given Laral a dowry in compensation.\r\n\u201CYou,\u201D Rillir said, nodding to Kal and speaking in a smooth, city accent. \u201CBe a good lad and fetch us some supper. We\u2019ll take it here in the nook.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m not a kitchen servant.\u201D\r\n\u201CSo?\u201D\r\nKal flushed.\r\n\u201CIf you\u2019re expecting some kind of tip or reward for just fetching me a meal\u2026\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m not\u2014I mean\u2014\u201D Kal looked to Laral. \u201CTell him, Laral.\u201D\r\nShe looked away. \u201CWell, go on, boy,\u201D she said. \u201CDo as you\u2019re told. We\u2019re hungry.\u201D\r\nKal gaped at her, then felt his face redden even more. \u201CI\u2019m\u2026I\u2019m not going to fetch you anything!\u201D he managed to say. \u201CI wouldn\u2019t do it no matter how many spheres you offer me. I\u2019m not an errand boy, I\u2019m a surgeon.\u201D\r\n\u201COh, you\u2019re\r\nthatone\u2019s son.\u201D\r\n\u201CI am,\u201D Kal said, surprised at how proudly he felt those words. \u201CI\u2019m not going to be bullied by you, Rillir Roshone. Just like my father isn\u2019t bullied by yours.\u201D\r\nExcept, they are making a deal right now\u2026.\r\n\u201CFather didn\u2019t mention how amusing you were,\u201D Rillir said, leaning back against the wall. He seemed a decade older than Kal, not a mere two years. \u201CSo you find it shameful to fetch a man his meal? Being a surgeon makes you that much better than the kitchen staff?\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, no. It\u2019s just not my Calling.\u201D\r\n\u201CThen what is your Calling?\u201D\r\n\u201CMaking sick people well.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd if I don\u2019t eat, won\u2019t I be sick? So couldn\u2019t you call it your duty to see me fed?\u201D\r\nKal frowned. \u201CIt\u2019s\u2026well, it\u2019s not the same thing at all.\u201D\r\n\u201CI see it as being very similar.\u201D\r\n\u201CLook, why don\u2019t you just go get yourself some food?\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s not my Calling.\u201D\r\n\u201CThen what\r\nisyour Calling?\u201D Kal returned, throwing the man\u2019s own words back at him.\r\n\u201CI\u2019m cityheir,\u201D Rillir said. \u201CMy duty is to lead\u2014to see that jobs get done and that people are occupied in productive work. And as such, I give important tasks to idling darkeyes to make them useful.\u201D\r\nKal hesitated, growing angry.\r\n\u201CYou see how his little mind works,\u201D Rillir said to Laral. \u201CLike a dying fire, burning what little fuel it has, pumping out smoke. Ah, and look, his face grows red from the heat of it.\u201D\r\n\u201CRillir, please,\u201D Laral said, laying her hand on his arm.\r\nRillir glanced at her, then rolled his eyes. \u201CYou\u2019re as provincial as my\u00A0 father sometimes, dear.\u201D He stood up straight and\u2014with a look of resignation\u2014led her past the nook and into the kitchen proper.\r\nKal sat back down hard, nearly bruising his legs on the bench with the force of it. A serving boy brought him his food and set it on the table, but that only reminded Kal of his childishness. So he didn\u2019t eat it; he just stared at it until, eventually, his father walked into the kitchen. Rillir and Laral were gone by then.\r\nLirin walked to the alcove and surveyed Kal. \u201CYou didn\u2019t eat.\u201D\r\nKal shook his head.\r\n\u201CYou should have. It was free. Come on.\u201D\r\nThey walked in silence from the mansion into the dark night. The carriage awaited them, and soon Kal again sat facing his father. The driver climbed into place, making the vehicle quiver, and a snap of his whip set the horses in motion.\r\n\u201CI want to be a surgeon,\u201D Kal said suddenly.\r\nHis father\u2019s face\u2014hidden in shadow\u2014was unreadable. But when he spoke, he sounded confused. \u201CI know that, son.\u201D\r\n\u201CNo. I want to be a surgeon. I don\u2019t want to run away to join the war.\u201D\r\nSilence in the darkness.\r\n\u201CYou were\r\nconsideringthat?\u201D Lirin asked.\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D Kal admitted. \u201CIt was childish. But I\u2019ve decided for myself that I want to learn surgery instead.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhy? What made you change?\u201D\r\n\u201CI need to know how\r\ntheythink,\u201D Kal said, nodding back toward the mansion. \u201CThey\u2019re trained to speak their sentences in knots, and I have to be able to face them and talk back at them. Not fold like\u2026\u201D He hesitated.\r\n\u201CLike I did?\u201D Lirin asked with a sigh.\r\nKal bit his lip, but had to ask. \u201CHow many spheres did you agree to give him? Will I still have enough to go to Kharbranth?\u201D\r\n\u201CI didn\u2019t give him a thing.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CRoshone and I talked for a time, arguing over amounts. I pretended to grow hotheaded and left.\u201D\r\n\u201CPretended?\u201D Kal asked, confused.\r\nHis father leaned forward, whispering to make certain the driver couldn\u2019t hear. With the bouncing and the noise of the wheels on the stone, there was little danger of that. \u201CHe has to think that I\u2019m willing to bend. Today\u2019s meeting was about giving the\r\nappearanceof desperation. A strong front at first, followed by frustration, letting him think that he\u2019d gotten to me. Finally a retreat. He\u2019ll invite me again in a few months, after letting me \u2018sweat.\u2019\u201D\r\n\u201CBut you won\u2019t bend then, either?\u201D Kal whispered.\r\n\u201CNo. Giving him any of the spheres would make him greedy for the rest. These lands don\u2019t produce as they used to, and Roshone is nearly broke from losing political battles. I still don\u2019t know which highlord was behind sending him here to torment us, though I wish I had him for a few moments in a dark room\u2026.\u201D\r\nThe ferocity with which Lirin said that shocked Kal. It was the closest he\u2019d ever heard his father come to threatening real violence.\r\n\u201CBut why go through this in the first place?\u201D Kal whispered. \u201CYou said that we can keep resisting him. Mother thinks so too. We won\u2019t eat well, but we won\u2019t starve.\u201D\r\nHis father didn\u2019t reply, though he looked troubled.\r\n\u201CYou need to make him think that we\u2019re capitulating,\u201D Kal said. \u201COr that we\u2019re close to doing so. So that he\u2019ll stop looking for ways to undermine us? So he\u2019ll focus his attention on making a deal and not\u2014\u201D\r\nKal froze. He saw something unfamiliar in his father\u2019s eyes. Something like guilt. Suddenly it made sense. Cold, terrible sense.\r\n\u201CStormfather,\u201D Kal whispered. \u201CYou\r\ndidsteal the spheres, didn\u2019t you?\u201D\r\nHis father remained silent, riding in the old carriage, shadowed and black.\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s why you\u2019ve been so tense since Wistiow died,\u201D Kal whispered. \u201CThe drinking, the worrying\u2026You\u2019re a thief! We\u2019re a family of thieves.\u201D\r\nThe carriage turned, and the violet light of Salas illuminated Lirin\u2019s face. He didn\u2019t look half so ominous from that angle\u2014in fact, he looked fragile. He clasped his hands before him, eyes reflecting moonlight. \u201CWistiow was not lucid during the final days, Kal,\u201D he whispered. \u201CI knew that, with his death, we would lose the promise of a union. Laral had not reached her day of majority, and the new citylord wouldn\u2019t let a darkeyes take her inheritance through marriage.\u201D\r\n\u201CSo you\r\nrobbedhim?\u201D Kal felt himself shrinking.\r\n\u201CI made certain that promises were kept. I had to do something. I couldn\u2019t trust to the generosity of the new citylord. Wisely, as you can see.\u201D\r\nAll of this time, Kal had assumed that Roshone was persecuting them out of malice and spite. But it turned out he was\r\njustified. \u201CI can\u2019t believe it.\u201D\r\n\u201CDoes it change so much?\u201D Lirin whispered. His face looked haunted in the dim light. \u201CWhat is different now?\u201D\r\n\u201CEverything.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd yet nothing. Roshone still wants those spheres, and we still deserve them. Wistiow, if he\u2019d been fully lucid, would have given us those spheres. I\u2019m certain.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut he didn\u2019t.\u201D\r\n\u201CNo.\u201D\r\nThings were the same, yet different. One step, and the world flipped upside down. The villain became the hero, the hero the villain. \u201CI\u2014\u201D Kal said. \u201CI can\u2019t decide if what you did was incredibly brave or incredibly wrong.\u201D\r\nLirin sighed. \u201CI know how you feel.\u201D He sat back. \u201CPlease, don\u2019t tell Tien what we\u2019ve done.\u201D What\r\nwe\u2019vedone. Hesina had helped him. \u201CWhen you are older, you\u2019ll understand.\u201D\r\n\u201CMaybe,\u201D Kal said, shaking his head. \u201CBut one thing hasn\u2019t changed. I want to go to Kharbranth.\u201D\r\n\u201CEven on stolen spheres?\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll find a way to pay them back. Not to Roshone. To Laral.\u201D\r\n\u201CShe\u2019ll be a Roshone before too long,\u201D Lirin said. \u201CWe should expect an engagement between her and Rillir before the year is out. Roshone will not let her slip away, not now that he\u2019s lost political favor in Kholinar. She represents one of the few chances his son has for an alliance with a good house.\u201D\r\nKal felt his stomach turn at the mention of Laral. \u201CI have to learn. Perhaps I can\u2026\u201D\r\nCan what,he thought.\r\nCome back and convince her to leave Rillir for me? Ridiculous.\r\nHe looked up suddenly at his father, who had bowed his head, looking sorrowful. He\r\nwasa hero. A villain too. But a hero to his family. \u201CI won\u2019t tell Tien,\u201D Kal whispered. \u201CAnd I\u2019m going to use the spheres to travel to Kholinar and study.\u201D\r\nHis father looked up.\r\n\u201CI want to learn to face lighteyes, like you do,\u201D Kal said. \u201CAny of them can make a fool of me. I want to learn to talk like them, think like them.\u201D\r\n\u201CI want you to learn so that you can help people, son. Not so you can get back at the lighteyes.\u201D\r\n\u201CI think I can do both. If I can learn to be clever enough.\u201D\r\nLirin snorted. \u201CYou\u2019re plenty clever, son. You\u2019ve got enough of your mother in you to talk circles around a lighteyes. The university will show you how, Kal.\u201D\r\n\u201CI want to start going by my full name,\u201D he replied, surprising himself. \u201CKaladin.\u201D It was a man\u2019s name. He\u2019d always disliked how it sounded like the name of a lighteyes. Now it seemed to fit.\r\nHe wasn\u2019t a darkeyed farmer, but he wasn\u2019t a lighteyed lord either. Something in between. Kal had been a child who wanted to join the army because it was what other boys dreamed of. Kaladin would be a man who learned surgery and all the ways of the lighteyes. And someday he would return to this town and prove to Roshone, Rillir, and Laral herself that they had been wrong to dismiss him.\r\n\u201CVery well,\u201D Lirin said. \u201CKaladin.\u201D"

Who bought corpses?\r\nHighprince Sadeas. He bought corpses. They still walked after he bought them, but they\r\nwerecorpses. The stupid ones refused to accept it, pretending they were alive.\r\nLacerations on face, arms, and chest. Outer layer of skin stripped away in several patches. Caused by prolonged exposure to highstorm winds. Bandage wounded areas, apply a denocax salve to encourage new skin growth.\r\nTime was passing. A lot of it. He should be dead. Why wasn\u2019t he dead? He wanted to lie back and let it happen.\r\nBut no.\r\nNo.He had failed Tien. He had failed Goshel. He had failed his parents. He had failed Dallet. Dear Dallet.\r\nHe would not fail Bridge Four. He would\r\nnot!\r\nHypothermia, caused by extreme cold. Warm subject and force him to remain seated. Do not let him sleep. If he survives a few hours, there will likely be no lasting aftereffects.\r\nIf he survives a few hours\u2026\r\nBridgemen weren\u2019t supposed to survive.\r\nWhy would Lamaril say that? What army would employ men who were supposed to die?\r\nHis perspective had been too narrow, too shortsighted. He needed to understand the army\u2019s objectives. He watched the battle\u2019s progress, horrified. What had he done?\r\nHe needed to go back and change it. But no. He was wounded, wasn\u2019t he? He was bleeding on the ground. He was one of the fallen spearmen. He was a bridgeman from Bridge Two, betrayed by those fools in Bridge Four, who diverted all of the archers.\r\nHow dare they? How\r\ndarethey?\r\nHow dare they survive by killing me!\r\nStrained tendons, ripped muscles, bruised and cracked bones, and pervasive soreness caused by extreme conditions. Enforce bed rest by any means necessary. Check for large and persistent bruises or pallor caused by internal hemorrhaging. That can be life-threatening. Be prepared for surgery.\r\nHe saw the deathspren. They were fist-size and black, with many legs and deep red eyes that glowed, leaving trails of burning light. They clustered around him, skittering this way and that. Their voices were whispers, scratchy sounds like paper being torn. They terrified him, but he couldn\u2019t escape them. He could barely move.\r\nOnly the dying could see deathspren. You saw them, then died. Only the very, very lucky few survived after that. Deathspren knew when the end was close.\r\nBlistered fingers and toes, caused by frostnip. Make sure to apply antiseptic to any blisters that break. Encourage the body\u2019s natural healing. Permanent damage is unlikely.\r\nStanding before the deathspren was a tiny figure of light. Not translucent, as she had always appeared before, but of pure white light. That soft, feminine face had a nobler, more angular cast to it now, like a warrior from a forgotten time. Not childlike at all. She stood guard on his chest, holding a sword made of light.\r\nThat glow was so pure, so sweet. It seemed to be the glow of life itself. Whenever one of the deathspren got too close, she would charge at it, wielding her radiant blade.\r\nThe light warded them off.\r\nBut there were a lot of deathspren. More and more each time he was lucid enough to look.\r\nSevere delusions caused by trauma to the head. Maintain observation of subject. Do not allow alcohol intake. Enforce rest. Administer fathom bark to reduce cranial swelling. Firemoss can be used in extreme cases, but beware letting the subject form an addiction.\r\nIf medication fails, trepanning the skull may be needed to relieve pressure.\r\nUsually fatal.\r\nTeft entered the barrack at midday. Ducking into the shadowy interior was like entering a cave. He glanced to the left, where the other wounded usually slept. They were all outside at the moment, getting some sun. All five were doing well, even Leyten.\r\nTeft passed the lines of rolled-up blankets at the sides of the room, walking to the back of the chamber where Kaladin lay.\r\nPoor man,Teft thought.\r\nWhat\u2019s worse, being sick near to death, or having to stay all the way back here, away from the light?It was necessary. Bridge Four walked a precarious line. They had been allowed to cut Kaladin down, and so far nobody had tried to stop them from caring for him. Practically the entire army had heard Sadeas give Kaladin to the Stormfather for judgment.\r\nGaz had come to see Kaladin, then had snorted to himself in amusement. He\u2019d likely told his superiors that Kaladin would die. Men didn\u2019t live long with wounds like those.\r\nYet Kaladin hung on. Soldiers were going out of their way to try to get a peek at him. His survival was incredible. People were talking in camp. Given to the Stormfather for judgment, then spared. A miracle. Sadeas wouldn\u2019t like that. How long would it be before one of the lighteyes decided to relieve their brightlord of the problem? Sadeas couldn\u2019t take any overt action\u2014not without losing a great deal of credibility\u2014but a quiet poisoning or suffocation would abbreviate the embarrassment.\r\nSo Bridge Four kept Kaladin as far from outside eyes as possible. And they always left someone with him. Always.\r\nStorming man,Teft thought, kneeling beside the feverish patient in his tousled blankets, eyes closed, face sweaty, body bound with a frightful number of bandages. Most were stained red. They didn\u2019t have the money to change them often.\r\nSkar kept watch currently. The short, strong-faced man sat at Kaladin\u2019s feet.\r\n\u201CHow is he?\u201D Teft asked.\r\nSkar spoke softly. \u201CHe seems to be getting worse, Teft. I heard him mumble about dark shapes, thrashing and telling them to keep back. He opened his eyes. He didn\u2019t seem to see me, but he saw\r\nsomething. I swear it.\u201D\r\nDeathspren,Teft thought, feeling a chill.\r\nKelek preserve us.\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll take a turn,\u201D Teft said, sitting. \u201CYou go get something to eat.\u201D\r\nSkar stood, looking pale. It would crush the others\u2019 spirit for Kaladin to survive the highstorm, then die of his wounds. Skar shuffled from the room, shoulders slumped.\r\nTeft watched Kaladin for a long while, trying to gather his thoughts, his emotions. \u201CWhy now?\u201D he whispered. \u201CWhy here? After so many have watched and waited, you come here?\u201D\r\nBut of course, Teft was getting ahead of himself. He didn\u2019t\r\nknowfor certain. He only had assumptions and hopes. No, not hopes\u2014\r\nfears. He had rejected the Envisagers. And yet, here he was. He fished in his pocket and pulled out three small diamond spheres. It had been a long, long while since he\u2019d saved anything of his wages, but he\u2019d held on to these, thinking, worrying. They glowed with Stormlight in his hand.\r\nDid he really want to know?\r\nGritting his teeth, Teft moved closer to Kaladin\u2019s side, looking down at the unconscious man\u2019s face. \u201CYou bastard,\u201D he whispered. \u201CYou storming bastard. You took a bunch of hanged men and lifted them up just enough to breathe. Now you\u2019re going to leave them? I won\u2019t have it, you hear. I\r\nwon\u2019t.\u201D\r\nHe pressed the spheres into Kaladin\u2019s hand, wrapping the limp fingers around them, then laying the hand on Kaladin\u2019s abdomen. Then Teft sat back on his heels. What would happen? All the Envisagers had were stories and legends. Fool\u2019s tales, Teft had called them. Idle dreams.\r\nHe waited. Of course, nothing happened.\r\nYou\u2019re as big a fool as any, Teft,he told himself. He reached for Kaladin\u2019s hand. Those spheres would buy a few drinks.\r\nKaladin gasped suddenly, drawing in a short, quick, powerful breath.\r\nThe glow in his hand faded.\r\nTeft froze, eyes widening. Wisps of Light began to rise from Kaladin\u2019s body. It was faint, but there was no mistaking that glowing white Stormlight streaming off his frame. It was as if Kaladin had been bathed in sudden heat, and his very skin steamed.\r\nKaladin\u2019s eyes snapped open, and they leaked light too, faintly colored amber. He gasped again loudly, and the trailing wisps of light began to twist around the exposed cuts on his chest. A few of them pulled together and knit themselves up.\r\nThen it was gone, the Light of those tiny chips expended. Kaladin\u2019s eyes closed and he relaxed. His wounds were still bad, his fever still raging, but some color had returned to his skin. The puffy redness around several cuts had diminished.\r\n\u201CMy God,\u201D Teft said, realizing he was trembling. \u201CAlmighty, cast from heaven to dwell in our hearts\u2026It is true.\u201D He bowed his head to the rock floor, squeezing his eyes shut, tears leaking from their corners.\r\nWhy now?he thought again.\r\nWhy here?\r\nAnd, in the name of all heaven, why me?\r\nHe knelt for a hundred heartbeats, counting, thinking, worrying. Eventually, he pulled himself to his feet and retrieved the spheres\u2014now dun\u2014from Kaladin\u2019s hand. He\u2019d need to trade them for spheres with Light in them. Then he could return and let Kaladin drain those as well.\r\nHe\u2019d have to be careful. A few spheres each day, but not too many. If the boy healed too quickly, it would draw too much attention.\r\nAnd I need to tell the Envisagers,he thought.\r\nI need to\u2026\r\nThe Envisagers were gone. Dead, because of what he had done. If there were others, he had no idea how to locate them.\r\nWho would he tell? Who would believe him? Kaladin himself probably didn\u2019t understand what he was doing.\r\nBest to keep it quiet, at least until he could figure out what to do about it."

      "ChapterName": "39: BURNED INTO HER",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\n\u201CWithin a heartbeat, Alezarv was there, crossing a distance that would have taken more than four months to travel by foot.\u201D\r\n\u2014Another folktale, this one recorded in\r\nAmong the Darkeyed,by Calinam. Page 102. Stories of instantaneous travel and the Oathgates pervade these tales.\r\nShallan\u2019s hand flew across the drawing board, moving as if of its own accord, charcoal scratching, sketching, smudging. Thick lines first, like trails of blood left by a thumb drawn across rough granite. Tiny lines like scratches made by a pin.\r\nShe sat in her closetlike stone chamber in the Conclave. No windows, no ornamentation on the granite walls. Just the bed, her trunk, the nightstand, and the small desk that doubled as a drawing table.\r\nA single ruby broam cast a bloody light on her sketch. Usually, to produce a vibrant drawing, she had to consciously memorize a scene. A blink, freezing the world, imprinting it into her mind. She hadn\u2019t done that during Jasnah\u2019s annihilation of the thieves. She\u2019d been too frozen by horror or morbid fascination.\r\nDespite that, she could see each of those scenes in her mind just as vividly as if she\u2019d deliberately memorized them. And these memories didn\u2019t vanish when she drew them. She couldn\u2019t rid her mind of them. Those deaths were burned into her.\r\nShe sat back from her drawing board, hand shaking, the picture before her an exact charcoal representation of the suffocating nightscape, squeezed between alley walls, a tortured figure of flame rising toward the sky. At that moment, its face still held its shape, shadow eyes wide and burning lips agape. Jasnah\u2019s hand was toward the figure, as if warding, or worshipping.\r\nShallan drew her charcoal-stained fingers to her chest, staring at her creation. It was one of dozens of drawings she\u2019d done during the last few days. The man turned into fire, the other frozen into crystal, the two transmuted to smoke. She could only draw one of those two fully; she\u2019d been facing down the alleyway to the east. Her drawings of the fourth man\u2019s death were of smoke rising, clothing already on the ground.\r\nShe felt guilty for being unable to record his death. And she felt stupid for that guilt.\r\nLogic did not condemn Jasnah. Yes, the princess had gone willingly into danger, but that didn\u2019t remove responsibility from those who had chosen to hurt her. The men\u2019s actions were reprehensible. Shallan had spent the days poring through books on philosophy, and most ethical frameworks exonerated the princess.\r\nBut Shallan had been there. She\u2019d watched those men die. She\u2019d seen the terror in their eyes, and she\r\nfeltterrible. Hadn\u2019t there been another way?\r\nKill or be killed. That was the Philosophy of Starkness. It exonerated Jasnah.\r\nActions are not evil. Intent is evil, and Jasnah\u2019s intent had been to stop men from harming others. That was the Philosophy of Purpose. It lauded Jasnah.\r\nMorality is separate from the ideals of men. It exists whole somewhere, to be approached\u2014but never truly understood\u2014by the mortal. The Philosophy of Ideals. It claimed that removing evil was ultimately moral, and so in destroying evil men, Jasnah was justified.\r\nObjective must be weighed against methods. If the goal is worthy, then the steps taken are worthwhile, even if some of them\u2014on their own\u2014are reprehensible. The Philosophy of Aspiration. It, more than any, called Jasnah\u2019s actions ethical.\r\nShallan pulled the sheet from her drawing board and tossed it down beside the others scattered across her bed. Her fingers moved again, clutching the charcoal pencil, beginning a new picture on the blank sheet strapped in place on the table, unable to escape.\r\nHer theft nagged at her as much as the killings did. Ironically, Jasnah\u2019s demand that Shallan study moralistic philosophy forced her to contemplate her own, terrible actions. She\u2019d come to Kharbranth to steal the fabrial, then use it to save her brothers and their house from massive debt and destruction. Yet in the end, this wasn\u2019t why Shallan had stolen the Soulcaster. She\u2019d taken it because she was angry with Jasnah.\r\nIf the intentions were more important than the action, then she had to condemn herself. Perhaps the Philosophy of Aspiration\u2014which stated that objectives were more important than the steps taken to achieve them\u2014would agree with what she\u2019d done, but that was the philosophy she found most reprehensible. Shallan sat here sketching, condemning Jasnah. But Shallan was the one who had betrayed a woman who had trusted her and taken her in. Now she was planning to commit heresy with the Soulcaster by using it although she was not an ardent.\r\nThe Soulcaster itself lay in the hidden part of Shallan\u2019s trunk. Three days, and Jasnah had said nothing about the disappearance. She wore the fake each day. She said nothing, acted no differently. Maybe she hadn\u2019t tried Soulcasting. Almighty send that she didn\u2019t go out and put herself into danger again, expecting to be able to use the fabrial to kill men who attacked her.\r\nOf course, there was one other aspect of that night that Shallan had to think of. She carried a concealed weapon that she hadn\u2019t used. She felt foolish for not even thinking of getting it out that night. But she wasn\u2019t accustomed to\u2014\r\nShallan froze, realizing for the first time what she\u2019d been drawing. Not another scene from the alleyway, but a lavish room with a thick, ornamented rug and swords on the walls. A long dining table, set with a half-eaten meal.\r\nAnd a dead man in fine clothing, lying face-first on the floor, blood pooling around him. She jumped back, tossing aside the charcoal, then crumpled up the paper. Shaking, she moved over and sat down on the bed among the pictures. Dropping the crumpled drawing, she raised her fingers to her forehead, feeling the cold sweat there.\r\nSomething was wrong with her, with her drawings.\r\nShe had to get out. Escape the death, the philosophy and the questions. She stood and hurriedly strode into the main room of Jasnah\u2019s quarters. The princess herself was away researching, as always. She hadn\u2019t demanded that Shallan come to the Veil today. Was that because she realized that her ward needed time to think alone? Or was it because she suspected Shallan of stealing the Soulcaster, and no longer trusted her?\r\nShallan hurried through the room. It was furnished only with the basics provided by King Taravangian. Shallan pulled open the door to the hallway, and nearly ran into a master-servant who had been reaching up to knock.\r\nThe woman started, and Shallan let out a yelp. \u201CBrightness,\u201D the woman said, bowing immediately. \u201CApologies. But one of your spanreeds is flashing.\u201D The woman held up the reed, affixed on the side with a small blinking ruby.\r\nShallan breathed in and out, stilling her heart. \u201CThank you,\u201D she said. She, like Jasnah, left her spanreeds in the care of servants because she was\u00A0often away from her rooms, and was likely to miss any attempt to contact her.\r\nStill flustered, she was tempted to leave the thing and continue on her way. However, she did need to speak with her brothers, Nan Balat particularly, and he\u2019d been away the last few times she\u2019d contacted home. She took the spanreed and closed the door. She didn\u2019t dare return to her rooms, with all of those sketches accusing her, but there was a desk and a spanreed board in the main room. She sat there, then twisted the ruby.\r\nShallan?the reed wrote.\r\nAre you comfortable?It was a code phrase, meant to indicate to her that it was indeed Nan Balat\u2014or, at least, his betrothed\u2014on the other side.\r\nMy back hurts and my wrist itches,she wrote back, giving the other half of the code phrase.\r\nI\u2019m sorry I missed your other communications,Nan Balat sent.\r\nI had to attend a feast in Father\u2019s name. It was with Sur Kamar, so it wasn\u2019t really something I could miss, despite the day of traveling each way.\r\nIt\u2019s all right,Shallan wrote. She took a deep breath.\r\nI have the item.She turned the gem.\r\nThe reed was still for a long moment. Finally, a hurried hand wrote,\r\nPraise the Heralds. Oh, Shallan. You\u2019ve done it! You are on your way back to us, then? How can you use the spanreed on the ocean? Are you in port?\r\nI haven\u2019t left,Shallan wrote.\r\nWhat? Why?\r\nBecause it would be too suspicious,she wrote.\r\nThink about it, Nan Balat. If Jasnah tries the item and finds it broken, she might not immediately decide that she\u2019s been had. That changes if I\u2019ve suddenly and suspiciously left for home.\r\nI have to wait until she\u2019s made the discovery, then see what she does next. If she realizes that her fabrial was replaced with a fake, then I can deflect her toward other culprits. She\u2019s already suspicious of the ardentia. If\u2014on the other hand\u2014she assumes that her fabrial has broken somehow, I\u2019ll know we\u2019re free.\r\nShe twisted the gem, setting the spanreed in place.\r\nThe question she\u2019d been expecting came next.\r\nAnd if she immediately assumes that you did it? Shallan, what if you can\u2019t deflect her suspicion? What if she orders a search of your chambers and they find the hidden compartment?\r\nShe picked up the pen.\r\nThen it is still better for me to be here,she wrote.\r\nBalat, I have learned much about Jasnah Kholin. She is incredibly focused and determined. She will not let me escape if she thinks I have robbed her. She will hunt me down, and will useall\r\nof her resources to exact retribution. We\u2019d have our own king and highprinces on our property in days, demanding that we turn over the fabrial. Stormfather! I\u2019ll bet Jasnah has contacts in Jah Keved that she could reach before I got back. I\u2019d find myself in custody the moment I landed.\r\nOur only hope is to deflect her. If that doesn\u2019t work, better for me to be here and suffer her wrath quickly. Likely she would take the Soulcaster and banish me from her sight. If we make her work and chase after me, though\u2026She can be very ruthless, Balat. It would not go well for us.\r\nThe response was long in coming.\r\nWhen did you get so good at logic, small one?he finally sent.\r\nI see that you\u2019ve thought this through. Better than I have, at least. But Shallan, our time is running out.\r\nI know,she wrote.\r\nYou said you could hold things together for a few more months. I ask you to do that. Give me two or three weeks, at least, to see what Jasnah does. Besides, while I am here, I can look into how the thing works. I haven\u2019t found any books that give hints, but there are so many here, maybe I just haven\u2019t found the right one yet.\r\nVery well,he wrote.\r\nA few weeks. Be careful, small one. The men who gave Father his fabrial visited again. They asked after you. I\u2019m worried about them. Even more than I worry about our finances. They disturb me in a profound way. Farewell.\r\nFarewell,she wrote back.\r\nSo far, there had been no hint of reaction from the princess. She hadn\u2019t even mentioned the Soulcaster. That made Shallan nervous. She wished that Jasnah would just say something. The waiting was excruciating. Each day, while she sat with Jasnah, Shallan\u2019s stomach churned with anxiety until she was nauseated. At least\u2014considering the killings a few days ago\u2014Shallan had a very good excuse for looking disturbed.\r\nCold, calm logic. Jasnah herself would be proud.\r\nA knock came at the door, and Shallan quickly gathered up the conversation she\u2019d had with Nan Balat and burned it in the hearth. A palace maid entered a moment later, carrying a basket in the crook of her arm. She smiled at Shallan. It was time for the daily cleaning.\r\nShallan had a strange moment of panic at seeing the woman. She wasn\u2019t one of the maids Shallan recognized. What if Jasnah had sent her or someone else to search Shallan\u2019s room? Had she done so already? Shallan nodded to the woman and then\u2014to assuage her worries\u2014she walked to her room and closed the door. She rushed to the chest and checked the hidden compartment. The fabrial was there. She lifted it out, inspecting it. Would she know if Jasnah somehow reversed the exchange?\r\nYou\u2019re being foolish,she told herself.\r\nJasnah\u2019s subtle, but she\u2019s notthat\r\nsubtle.Still, Shallan stuffed the Soulcaster in her safepouch. It just barely fit inside the envelope-like cloth container. She\u2019d feel safer knowing she had it on her while the maid cleaned her room. Besides, the safepouch might be a better hiding place for it than her trunk.\r\nBy tradition, a woman\u2019s safepouch was where she kept items of intimate or very precious import. To search one would be like strip-searching her\u2014considering her rank, either would be virtually unthinkable unless she were obviously implicated in a crime. Jasnah could probably force it. But if Jasnah could do that, she could order a search of Shallan\u2019s room, and her trunk would be under particular scrutiny. The truth was, if Jasnah chose to suspect her, there would be little Shallan could do to hide the fabrial. So the safepouch was as good a place as any.\r\nShe gathered up the pictures she\u2019d drawn and put them upside-down on the desk, trying not to look at them. She didn\u2019t want those to be seen by the maid. Finally, she left, taking her portfolio. She felt that she needed to get outside and escape for a while. Draw something other than death and murder. The conversation with Nan Balat had only served to upset her more.\r\n\u201CBrightness?\u201D the maid asked.\r\nShallan froze, but the maid held up a basket. \u201CThis was dropped off for you with the master-servants.\u201D\r\nShe hesitantly accepted it, looking inside. Bread and jam. A note, tied to one of the jars, read:\r\nBluebar jam. If you like it, it means you\u2019re mysterious, reserved, and thoughtful.It was signed Kabsal.\r\nShallan placed the basket\u2019s handle in the crook of her safearm\u2019s elbow. Kabsal. Maybe she should go find him. She always felt better after a conversation with him.\r\nBut no. She was going to leave; she couldn\u2019t keep stringing him, or herself, along. She was afraid of where the relationship was going. Instead, she made her way to the main cavern and then to the Conclave\u2019s exit. She walked out into the sunlight and took a deep breath, looking up into the sky as servants and attendants parted around her, swarming in and out of the Conclave. She held her portfolio close, feeling the cool breeze on her cheeks and the contrasting warmth of the sunlight pressing down on her\u00A0hair and forehead.\r\nIn the end, the most disturbing part was that Jasnah had been right. Shallan\u2019s world of simple answers had been a foolish, childish place. She\u2019d clung to the hope that she could find truth, and use it to explain\u2014perhaps justify\u2014what she had done back in Jah Keved. But if there was such a thing as truth, it was far more complicated and murky than she\u2019d assumed.\r\nSome problems didn\u2019t seem to have any good answers. Just a lot of wrong ones. She could choose the source of her guilt, but she couldn\u2019t choose to be rid of that guilt entirely.\r\nTwo hours\u2014and about twenty quick sketches\u2014later, Shallan felt far more relaxed.\r\nShe sat in the palace gardens, sketchpad in her lap, drawing snails. The gardens weren\u2019t as extensive as her father\u2019s, but they were far more varied, not to mention blessedly secluded. Like many modern gardens, they were designed with walls of cultivated shalebark. This one\u2019s made a maze of living stone. They were short enough that, when standing, she could see the way back to the entrance. But if she sat down on one of the numerous benches, she could feel alone and unseen.\r\nShe\u2019d asked a groundskeeper the name of the most prominent shalebark plant; he\u2019d called it \u201Cplated stone.\u201D A fitting name, as it grew in thin round sections that piled atop one another, like plates in a cupboard. From the sides, it looked like weathered rock that exposed hundreds of thin strata. Tiny little tendrils grew up out of pores, waving in the wind. The stonelike casings had a bluish shade, but the tendrils were yellowish.\r\nHer current subject was a snail with a low horizontal shell edged with little ridges. When she tapped, it would flatten itself into a rift in the shalebark, appearing to become part of the plated stone. It blended in perfectly. When she let it move, it nibbled at the shalebark\u2014but didn\u2019t chew it away.\r\nIt\u2019s cleaning the shalebark,she realized, continuing her sketch.\r\nEating off the lichen and mold.Indeed, a cleaner trail extended behind it.\r\nPatches of a different kind of shalebark\u2014with fingerlike protrusions growing up into the air from a central knob\u2014grew alongside the plated stone. When she looked closely, she noted little cremlings\u2014thin and multilegged\u2014crawling along it, eating at it. Were they too cleaning it?\r\nCurious,she thought, beginning a sketch of the miniature cremlings. They had carapaces shaded like the shalebark\u2019s fingers, while the snail\u2019s shell was a near duplicate of the yellow and blue colorings of the plated stone. It was as if they had been designed by the Almighty in pairs, the plant giving safety to the animal, the animal cleaning the plant.\r\nA few lifespren\u2014tiny, glowing green specks\u2014floated around the shalebark mounds. Some danced amid the rifts in the bark, others in the air like dust motes zigzagging up, only to fall again.\r\nShe used a finer-tipped charcoal pencil to scribble some thoughts about the relationship between the animals and the plants. She didn\u2019t know of any books that spoke of relationships like this one. Scholars seemed to prefer studying big, dynamic animals, like greatshells or whitespines. But this seemed a beautiful, wondrous discovery to Shallan.\r\nSnails and plants can help one another,she thought.\r\nBut I betray Jasnah.\r\nShe glanced toward her safehand, and the pouch hidden inside. She felt more secure having the Soulcaster near. She hadn\u2019t yet dared try to use it. She\u2019d been too nervous about the theft, and had worried about using the object near Jasnah. Now, however, she was in a nook deep within the maze, with only one curving entrance into her dead end. She stood up casually, looking around. No one else was in the gardens, and she was far enough inside that it would take minutes for anyone to get to her.\r\nShallan sat back down, setting aside her drawing pad and pencil.\r\nI might as well see if I can figure out how to use it,she thought.\r\nMaybe there\u2019s no need to keep searching the Palanaeum for a solution.So long as she stood up and glanced about periodically, she could be certain she wouldn\u2019t be approached or seen by accident.\r\nShe removed the forbidden device. It was heavy in her hand. Solid. Taking a deep breath, she looped the chains over her fingers and around her wrist, the gemstones set against the back of her hand. The metal was cold, the chains loose. She flexed her hand, pulling the fabrial tight.\r\nShe\u2019d anticipated a feeling of power. Prickles on her skin, perhaps, or a sense of strength and might. But there was nothing.\r\nShe tapped the three gemstones\u2014she\u2019d placed her smokestone into the third setting. Some other fabrials, like spanreeds, worked when you tapped the stones. But that was foolish, as she\u2019d never seen Jasnah do that. The woman just closed her eyes and touched something, Soulcasting it. Smoke, crystal, and fire were what this Soulcaster was best at. Only once had she seen Jasnah create anything else.\r\nHesitant, Shallan took a piece of broken shalebark from the base of one of the plants. She held it up in her freehand, then closed her eyes.\r\nBecome smoke!she commanded.\r\nNothing happened.\r\nBecome crystal!she commanded instead.\r\nShe cracked an eye. There was no change.\r\nFire. Burn! You\u2019re fire! You\u2014\r\nShe paused, realizing the stupidity of that. A mysteriously burned hand? No, that wouldn\u2019t be\r\nat allsuspicious. Instead, she focused on crystal. She closed her eyes again, holding the image of a piece of quartz in her mind. She tried to\r\nwillthe shalebark to change.\r\nNothing happened, so she just tried focusing, imagining the shalebark transforming. After a few minutes of failure, she tried making the pouch change instead, then tried the bench, then tried one of her hairs. Nothing worked.\r\nShallan checked to make certain she was still alone, then sat down, frustrated. Nan Balat had asked Luesh how the devices worked, and he\u2019d said that it was easier to show than explain. He\u2019d promised to give them answers if she actually managed to steal Jasnah\u2019s.\r\nNow he was dead. Was she doomed to carry this one back to her family, only to immediately give it away to those dangerous men, never using it to gain wealth to protect her house? All because they didn\u2019t know how to activate it?\r\nThe other fabrials she\u2019d used had been simple to activate, but those were constructed by contemporary artifabrians. Soulcasters were fabrials from ancient times. They wouldn\u2019t employ modern methods of activation. She stared at the glowing gemstones suspended on the back of her hand. How would she figure out the method of using a tool thousands of years old, one forbidden to any but ardents?\r\nShe slid the Soulcaster back into her safepouch. It seemed she was back to searching the Palanaeum. That or asking Kabsal. But would she manage that without looking suspicious? She broke out his bread and jam, eating and thinking idly. If Kabsal didn\u2019t know, and if she couldn\u2019t find the answers by the time she left Kharbranth, were there other options? If she took the artifact to the Veden king\u2014or maybe the ardents\u2014might they be able to protect her family in exchange for the gift? After all, she couldn\u2019t really be blamed for stealing from a heretic, and so long as Jasnah didn\u2019t know who had the Soulcaster, they would be safe.\r\nFor some reason, that made her feel even worse. Stealing the Soulcaster to save her family was one thing, but turning it over to the very ardents whom Jasnah disdained? It seemed a greater betrayal.\r\nYet another difficult decision.\r\nWell then,she thought,\r\nit\u2019s a good thing Jasnah is so determined to train me in how to deal with those. By the time all this is done, I should be quite the expert\u2026."

      "ChapterName": "40: EYES OF RED AND BLUE",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\n\u201CDeath upon the lips. Sound upon the air. Char upon the skin.\u201D\r\n\u2014From \u201CThe Last Desolation\u201D by Ambrian, line 335.\r\nKaladin stumbled into the light, shading his eyes against the burning sun, his bare feet feeling the transition from cold indoor stone to sun-warmed stone outside. The air was lightly humid, not muggy as it had been in previous weeks.\r\nHe rested his hand on the wooden doorframe, his legs quivering rebelliously, his arms feeling as if he\u2019d carried a bridge for three days straight. He breathed deeply. His side should have blazed with pain, but he felt only a residual soreness. Some of his deeper cuts were still scabbed over, but the smaller ones had vanished completely. His head was surprisingly clear. He didn\u2019t even have a headache.\r\nHe rounded the side of the barrack, feeling stronger with each step, though he kept his hand on the wall. Lopen followed behind; the Herdazian had been watching over Kaladin when he awoke.\r\nI should be dead,Kaladin thought.\r\nWhat is going on?\r\nOn the other side of the barrack he was surprised to find the men carrying their bridge in daily practice. Rock ran at the front center, giving the marching beat as Kaladin had once done. They reached the other side of the lumberyard and turned around, charging back. Only when they were almost past the barrack did one of the men in front\u2014Moash\u2014notice Kaladin. He froze, nearly causing the entire bridge crew to trip.\r\n\u201CWhat is wrong with you?\u201D Torfin yelled from behind, head enveloped by the wood of the bridge.\r\nMoash didn\u2019t listen. He ducked out from under the bridge, looking at Kaladin with wide eyes. Rock gave a hasty shout for the men to put down the bridge. More saw him, adopting the same reverent expressions as Moash. Hobber and Peet, their wounds sufficiently healed, had started practicing with the others. That was good. They\u2019d be drawing pay again.\r\nThe men walked up to Kaladin, silent in their leather vests. They kept their distance, hesitant, as if he were fragile. Or holy. Kaladin was bare-chested, his nearly healed wounds exposed, and wore only his knee-length bridgeman\u2019s trousers.\r\n\u201CYou really need to practice what to do if one of you trips or stumbles, men,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CWhen Moash stopped abruptly, you all about fell over. That could be a disaster on the field.\u201D\r\nThey stared at him, incredulous, and he couldn\u2019t help but smile. In a moment, they crowded around him, laughing and thumping him on the back. It wasn\u2019t an entirely appropriate welcome for a sick man, particularly when Rock did it, but Kaladin did appreciate their enthusiasm.\r\nOnly Teft didn\u2019t join in. The aging bridgeman stood at the side, arms folded. He seemed concerned. \u201CTeft?\u201D Kaladin asked. \u201CYou all right?\u201D\r\nTeft snorted, but showed a hint of a grin. \u201CI just figure those lads don\u2019t bathe often enough for me to want to get close enough for a hug. No offense.\u201D\r\nKaladin laughed. \u201CI understand.\u201D His last \u201Cbath\u201D had been the highstorm.\r\nThe highstorm.\r\nThe other bridgemen continued to laugh, asking how he felt, proclaiming that Rock would have to fix something\r\nextraspecial for their nightly fireside meal. Kaladin smiled and nodded, assuring them he felt well, but he was remembering the storm.\r\nHe recalled it distinctly. Holding to the ring atop the building, his head down and eyes closed against the pelting torrent. He remembered Syl, standing protectively before him, as if she could turn back the storm itself. He couldn\u2019t see her about now. Where was she?\r\nHe also remembered the face. The Stormfather himself? Surely not. A delusion. Yes\u2026yes, he\u2019d certainly been delusional. Memories of deathspren were blended with relived parts of his life\u2014and both mixed with strange, sudden\r\nshocksof strength\u2014icy cold, but refreshing. It had been like the cold air of a crisp morning after a long night in a stuffy room, or like rubbing the sap of gulket leaves on sore muscles, making them feel warm and cold at the same time.\r\nHe could remember those moments so clearly. What had caused them? The fever?\r\n\u201CHow long?\u201D he said, checking over the bridgemen, counting them. Thirty-three, counting Lopen and the silent Dabbid. Almost all were accounted for. Impossible. If his ribs were healed, then he must have been unconscious for three weeks, at least. How many bridge runs?\r\n\u201CTen days,\u201D Moash said.\r\n\u201CImpossible,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CMy wounds\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CIs why we\u2019re so surprised to see you up and walking!\u201D Rock said, laughing. \u201CYou must have bones like granite. Is my name you should be having!\u201D\r\nKaladin leaned back against the wall. Nobody corrected Moash. An entire crew of men couldn\u2019t lose track of the weeks like that. \u201CIdolir and Treff?\u201D he asked.\r\n\u201CWe lost them,\u201D Moash said, growing solemn. \u201CWe did two bridge runs while you were unconscious. Nobody badly wounded, but two dead. We\u2026we didn\u2019t know how to help them.\u201D\r\nThat made the men grow subdued. But death was the way of bridgemen, and they couldn\u2019t afford to dwell for long on the lost. Kaladin\u00A0did\u00A0decide, however, that he\u2019d need to train a few of the others in healing.\r\nBut how was he up and walking? Had he been less injured than he\u2019d assumed? Hesitantly, he prodded at his side, feeling for broken ribs. Just a little sore. Other than the weakness, he felt as healthy as he ever had. Perhaps he should have paid a little more attention to his mother\u2019s religious teachings.\r\nAs the men turned back to talking and celebrating, he noticed the looks they gave him. Respectful, reverent. They remembered what he\u2019d said before the highstorm. Looking back, Kaladin realized he\u2019d been a little delirious. It now seemed an incredibly arrogant proclamation, not to mention that it smelled of prophecy. If the ardents discovered that\u2026\r\nWell, he couldn\u2019t undo what he\u2019d done. He\u2019d just have to continue.\r\nYou were already balancing over a chasm,Kaladin thought to himself.\r\nDid you have to scale an evenhigher\r\ncliffside?\r\nA sudden, mournful horn call sounded across the camp. The bridgemen fell silent. The horn sounded twice more.\r\n\u201CFigures,\u201D Natam said.\r\n\u201CWe\u2019re on duty?\u201D Kaladin asked.\r\n\u201CYeah,\u201D Moash said.\r\n\u201CLine up!\u201D Rock snapped. \u201CYou know what to do! Let\u2019s show Captain Kaladin that we haven\u2019t forgotten how to do this.\u201D\r\n\u201C\u2018Captain\u2019 Kaladin?\u201D Kaladin asked as the men lined up.\r\n\u201CSure, gancho,\u201D Lopen said from beside him, speaking with that quick accent that seemed so at odds with his nonchalant attitude. \u201CThey tried to make Rock bridgeleader, sure, but we just started calling you \u2018captain\u2019 and him \u2018squadleader.\u2019 Made Gaz angry.\u201D Lopen grinned.\r\nKaladin nodded. The other men were so joyous, but he was finding it difficult to share their mood.\r\nAs they formed up around their bridge, he began to realize the source of his melancholy. His men were right back where they\u2019d started. Or worse. He was weakened and injured, and had offended the highprince himself. Sadeas would not be pleased when he learned that Kaladin had survived his fever.\r\nThe bridgemen were still destined to be cut down one by one. The side carry had been a failure. He hadn\u2019t saved his men, he\u2019d just given them a short stay of execution.\r\nBridgemen aren\u2019t supposed to survive\u2026.\r\nHe suspected why that was. Gritting his teeth, he let go of the barrack wall and crossed to where the bridgemen stood in line, leaders of the sub-squads doing a quick check of their vests and sandals.\r\nRock eyed Kaladin. \u201CAnd what is this thing you believe you are doing?\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m joining you,\u201D Kaladin said.\r\n\u201CAnd what would you tell one of the men if\r\ntheyhad just gotten up from a week with the fevers?\u201D\r\nKaladin hesitated.\r\nI\u2019m not like the other men,he thought, then regretted it. He couldn\u2019t start believing himself invincible. To run now with the crew, as weak as he was, would be sheer idiocy. \u201CYou\u2019re right.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou can help me and the moolie carry water, gancho,\u201D Lopen said. \u201CWe\u2019re a team now. Go on every run.\u201D\r\nKaladin nodded. \u201CAll right.\u201D\r\nRock eyed him.\r\n\u201CIf I\u2019m feeling too weak at the end of the permanent bridges, I\u2019ll go back. I promise.\u201D\r\nRock nodded reluctantly. The men marched under the bridge to the staging area, and Kaladin joined Lopen and Dabbid, filling waterskins.\r\nKaladin stood at the edge of the precipice, hands clasped behind his back, sandaled toes at the very edge of the cliff. The chasm stared up at him, but he did not meet its gaze. He was focused on the battle being waged on the next plateau.\r\nThis approach had been an easy one; they\u2019d arrived at the same time as the Parshendi. Instead of bothering to kill bridgemen, the Parshendi had taken a defensive position in the center of the plateau, around the chrysalis. Now Sadeas\u2019s men fought them.\r\nKaladin\u2019s brow was slick with sweat from the day\u2019s heat, and he still felt a lingering exhaustion from his sickness. Yet it wasn\u2019t nearly as bad as it should have been. The surgeon\u2019s son was baffled.\r\nFor the moment, the soldier overruled the surgeon. He was transfixed by the battle. Alethi spearmen in leathers and breastplates pressed a curved line against the Parshendi warriors. Most Parshendi used battle-axes or hammers, though a few wielded swords or clubs. They all had that red-orange armor growing from their skin, and they fought in pairs, singing all the while.\r\nIt was the worst kind of battle, the kind that was close. Often, you\u2019d lose far fewer men in a skirmish where your enemies quickly gained the upper hand. When that happened, your commander would order the retreat to cut his losses. But close battles\u2026they were brutal, blood-soaked things. Watching the fighting\u2014the bodies dropped to the rocks, the weapons flashing, the men pushed off the plateau\u2014reminded him of his first fights as a spearman. His commander had been shocked at how easily Kaladin dealt with seeing blood. Kaladin\u2019s father would have been shocked at how easily Kaladin spilled it.\r\nThere was a big difference between his battles in Alethkar and the fights on the Shattered Plains. There, he\u2019d been surrounded by the worst\u2014or at least worst-trained\u2014soldiers in Alethkar. Men who didn\u2019t hold their lines. And yet, for all their disorder, those fights had made sense to him. These here on the Shattered Plains still did not.\r\nThat had been his miscalculation. He\u2019d changed battlefield tactics before understanding them. He would not make that mistake again.\r\nRock stepped up beside Kaladin, joined by Sigzil. The thick-limbed Horneater made for quite a contrast to the short, quiet Azish man. Sigzil\u2019s skin was a deep brown\u2014not true black, like some parshmen\u2019s. He tended to keep to himself.\r\n\u201CIs bad battle,\u201D Rock said, folding his arms. \u201CThe soldiers will not be happy, whether or not they win.\u201D\r\nKaladin nodded absently, listening to the yells, screams, and curses. \u201CWhy do they fight, Rock?\u201D\r\n\u201CFor money,\u201D Rock said. \u201CAnd for vengeance. You should know this thing. Is it not your king who Parshendi killed?\u201D\r\n\u201COh, I understand why\r\nwefight,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CBut the Parshendi. Why do\r\ntheyfight?\u201D\r\nRock grinned. \u201CIs because they don\u2019t very much like the idea of being beheaded for killing your king, I should think! Very unaccommodating of them.\u201D\r\nKaladin smiled, though he found mirth unnatural while watching men die. He had been trained too long by his father for any death to leave him unmoved. \u201CPerhaps. But, then, why do they fight for the gemhearts? Their numbers are dwindling because of skirmishes like these.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou know this thing?\u201D Rock asked.\r\n\u201CThey raid less frequently than they used to,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CPeople talk about it in camp. And they don\u2019t strike as close to the Alethi side as they once did.\u201D\r\nRock nodded thoughtfully. \u201CIt seems logical. Ha! Perhaps we will soon win this fight and be going home.\u201D\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D Sigzil said softly. He had a very formal way of speaking, with barely a hint of an accent. What language did the Azish speak, anyway? Their kingdom was so distant that Kaladin had only ever met one other. \u201CI doubt that. And I can tell you why they fight, Kaladin.\u201D\r\n\u201CReally?\u201D\r\n\u201CThey must have Soulcasters. They need the gemstones for the same reason we do. To make food.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt sounds reasonable,\u201D Kaladin said, hands still clasped behind his back, feet in a wide stance. Parade rest still felt natural to him. \u201CJust conjecture, but a reasonable one. Let me ask you something else, then. Why can\u2019t bridgemen have shields?\u201D\r\n\u201CBecause this thing makes us too slow,\u201D Rock said.\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D Sigzil said. \u201CThey could send bridgemen with shields out in front of the bridges, running in front of us. It wouldn\u2019t slow anyone down. Yes, you would have to field more bridgemen\u2014but you\u2019d save enough lives with those shields to make up for the larger roster.\u201D\r\nKaladin nodded. \u201CSadeas fields more of us than he needs already. In most cases, more bridges land than he needs.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut why?\u201D Sigzil asked.\r\n\u201CBecause we make good targets,\u201D Kaladin said softly, understanding. \u201CWe\u2019re put out in front to draw Parshendi attention.\u201D\r\n\u201COf course we are,\u201D Rock said, shrugging. \u201CArmies always do these things. The poorest and the least trained go first.\u201D\r\n\u201CI know,\u201D Kaladin said, \u201Cbut usually, they\u2019re at least given some measure of protection. Don\u2019t you see? We\u2019re not just an expendable initial wave. We\u2019re\r\nbait. We\u2019re exposed, so the Parshendi can\u2019t help but fire at us. It allows the regular soldiers to approach without being hurt. The Parshendi archers are aiming at the bridgemen.\u201D\r\nRock frowned.\r\n\u201CShields would make us less tempting,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CThat\u2019s why he forbids them.\u201D\r\n\u201CPerhaps,\u201D Sigzil said from the side, thoughtful. \u201CBut it seems foolish to waste troops.\u201D\r\n\u201CActually, it\r\nisn\u2019tfoolish,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CIf you have to repeatedly attack fortified positions, you can\u2019t afford to lose your trained troops. Don\u2019t you see? Sadeas has only a limited number of trained men. But untrained ones are easy to find. Each arrow that strikes down a bridgeman is one that\r\ndoesn\u2019thit a soldier you\u2019ve spent a great deal of money outfitting and training. That\u2019s why it\u2019s better for Sadeas to field a large number of bridgemen, rather than a smaller\u2014but protected\u2014number.\u201D\r\nHe should have seen it earlier. He had been distracted by how important bridgemen were to the battles. If the bridges didn\u2019t arrive at the chasms, then the army couldn\u2019t cross. But each bridge crew was kept well stocked with bodies, and twice as many bridge crews were sent on an assault as were needed.\r\nSeeing a bridge fall must give the Parshendi a great sense of satisfaction, and they usually got to drop two or three bridges on every bad chasm run. Sometimes more. So long as bridgemen were dying, and the Parshendi didn\u2019t spend their time firing on soldiers, Sadeas had reason to keep the bridgemen vulnerable. The Parshendi should have seen through it, but it was very hard to turn your arrow away from the unarmored man carrying the siege equipment. The Parshendi were said to be unsophisticated fighters. Indeed, watching the battle on the other plateau\u2014studying it, focusing\u2014he saw that was true.\r\nWhere the Alethi maintained a straight, disciplined line\u2014each man protecting his partners\u2014the Parshendi attacked in independent pairs. The Alethi had superior technique and tactics. True, each of the Parshendi was superior in strength, and their skill with those axes was remarkable. But Sadeas\u2019s Alethi troops were well trained in modern formations. Once they got a foothold\u2014and if they could prolong the battle\u2014their discipline often saw them to victory.\r\nThe Parshendi haven\u2019t fought in large-scale battles before this war,Kaladin decided.\r\nThey\u2019re used to smaller skirmishes, perhaps against other villages or clans.\r\nSeveral of the other bridgemen joined Kaladin, Rock, and Sigzil. Before long, the majority of them were standing there, some imitating Kaladin\u2019s stance. It took another hour before the battle was won. Sadeas proved victorious, but Rock was right. The soldiers were grim; they\u2019d lost many friends this day.\r\nIt was a tired, battered group of spearmen that Kaladin and the others led back to camp.\r\nA few hours later, Kaladin sat on a chunk of wood beside Bridge Four\u2019s nightly fire. Syl sat on his knee, having taken the form of a small, translucent blue and white flame. She\u2019d come to him during the march back, spinning around gleefully to see him up and walking, but had given no explanation for her absence.\r\nThe real fire crackled and popped, Rock\u2019s large pot bubbling on top of it, some flamespren dancing on the logs. Every couple of seconds, someone asked Rock if the stew was done yet, often banging on his bowl with a good-natured smack of the spoon. Rock said nothing, stirring. They all knew that nobody ate until he declared the stew finished; he was very particular about not serving \u201Cinferior\u201D food.\r\nThe air smelled of boiling dumplings. The men were laughing. Their bridgeleader had survived execution and today\u2019s bridge run hadn\u2019t cost a single casualty. Spirits were high.\r\nExcept for Kaladin\u2019s.\r\nHe understood now. He understood just how futile their struggle was. He understood why Sadeas hadn\u2019t bothered to acknowledge Kaladin\u2019s survival. He was already a bridgeman, and being a bridgeman was a death sentence.\r\nKaladin had hoped to show Sadeas that his bridge crew could be efficient and useful. He\u2019d hoped to prove that they deserved protection\u2014shields, armor, training. Kaladin thought that if they acted like soldiers, maybe they would be\r\nseenas soldiers.\r\nNone of that would work. A bridgeman who survived was, by definition, a bridgeman who had failed.\r\nHis men laughed and enjoyed the fire. They trusted him. He\u2019d done the\u00A0impossible, surviving a highstorm, wounded, tied to a wall. Surely he would perform another miracle, this time for them. They were good men, but they thought like foot soldiers. The officers and the lighteyes would worry about the long term. The men were fed and happy, and that was enough for now.\r\nNot for Kaladin.\r\nHe found himself face-to-face with the man he\u2019d left behind. The one he\u2019d abandoned that night he\u2019d decided not to throw himself into the chasm. A man with haunted eyes, a man who had given up on caring or hoping. A walking corpse.\r\nI\u2019m going to fail them,he thought.\r\nHe couldn\u2019t let them continue running bridges, dying off one by one. But he also couldn\u2019t think of an alternative. And so their laughter tore at him.\r\nOne of the men\u2014Maps\u2014stood, holding up his arms, quieting the others. It was the time between moons, and so he was lit mostly by the firelight; there was a spray of stars in the sky above. Several of those moved about, the tiny pinpricks of light chasing after one another, zipping around like distant, glowing insects. Starspren. They were rare.\r\nMaps was a flat-faced fellow, his beard bushy, his eyebrows thick. Everyone called him Maps because of the birthmark on his chest that he swore was an exact map of Alethkar, though Kaladin hadn\u2019t been able to see the resemblance.\r\nMaps cleared his throat. \u201CIt\u2019s a good night, a special night, and all. We\u2019ve got our bridgeleader back.\u201D\r\nSeveral of the men clapped. Kaladin tried not to show how sick he felt inside.\r\n\u201CWe\u2019ve got good food coming,\u201D Maps said. He eyed Rock. \u201CIt\r\niscoming, ain\u2019t it, Rock?\u201D\r\n\u201CIs coming,\u201D Rock said, stirring.\r\n\u201CYou\u2019re sure about that? We could go on another bridge run. Give you a little extra time, you know, five or six more hours\u2026.\u201D\r\nRock gave him a fierce look. The men laughed, several banging their bowls with their spoons. Maps chuckled, then he reached to the ground behind the stone he was using for a seat. He pulled out a paper-wrapped package and tossed it to Rock.\r\nSurprised, the tall Horneater barely caught it, nearly dropping it into the stew.\r\n\u201CFrom all of us,\u201D Maps said, a little awkwardly, \u201Cfor making us stew each night. Don\u2019t think we haven\u2019t noticed how hard you work on it. We relax while you cook. And you always serve everyone else first. So we bought you something to thank you.\u201D He wiped his nose on his arm, spoiling the moment slightly, and sat back down. Several of the other bridgemen thumped him on the back, complimenting his speech.\r\nRock unwrapped the package and stared into it for a long while. Kaladin leaned forward, trying to get a look at the contents. Rock reached in and held the item up. It was a straight razor of gleaming silvery steel; there was a length of wood covering the sharp side. Rock pulled this off, inspecting the blade. \u201CYou airsick fools,\u201D he said softly. \u201CIs beautiful.\u201D\r\n\u201CThere\u2019s a piece of polished steel too,\u201D said Peet. \u201CFor a mirror. And some beard soap and a leather strop for sharpening.\u201D\r\nAmazingly, Rock grew teary-eyed. He turned away from the pot, bearing his gifts. \u201CStew is ready,\u201D he said. Then he ran into the barrack building.\r\nThe men sat quietly. \u201CStormfather,\u201D youthful Dunny finally said, \u201Cyou think we did the right thing? I mean, the way he complains and all\u2026\u201D\r\n\u201CI think it was perfect,\u201D Teft said. \u201CJust give the big lout some time to recover.\u201D\r\n\u201CSorry we didn\u2019t get you nothin\u2019, sir,\u201D Maps said to Kaladin. \u201CWe didn\u2019t know you\u2019d be awake and all.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s all right,\u201D Kaladin said.\r\n\u201CWell,\u201D Skar said. \u201CIs someone going to serve that stew, or will we all just sit here hungry until it burns?\u201D\r\nDunny jumped up, grabbing the ladle. The men gathered around the pot, jostling one another as Dunny served. Without Rock there to snap at them and keep them in line, it was something of a melee. Only Sigzil did not join in. The quiet, dark-skinned man sat to the side, eyes reflecting the flames.\r\nKaladin rose. He was worried\u2014terrified, really\u2014that he might become that wretch again. The one who had given up on caring because he saw no alternative. So he sought conversation, walking over toward Sigzil. His motion disturbed Syl, who sniffed and buzzed up onto his shoulder. She still held the form of a flickering flame; having that on his shoulder was even\r\nmoredistracting. He didn\u2019t say anything; if she knew it bothered him, she\u2019d be likely to do it more. She\r\nwasstill a windspren, after all.\r\nKaladin sat down next to Sigzil. \u201CNot hungry?\u201D\r\n\u201CThey are more eager than I,\u201D Sigzil said. \u201CIf previous evenings are a reliable guide, there will still be enough for me once they have filled their bowls.\u201D\r\nKaladin nodded. \u201CI appreciated your analysis out on the plateau today.\u201D\r\n\u201CI am good at that, sometimes.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou\u2019re educated. You speak like it and you act like it.\u201D\r\nSigzil hesitated. \u201CYes,\u201D he finally said. \u201CAmong my people, it is not a sin for a male to be keen of mind.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt isn\u2019t a sin for Alethi either.\u201D\r\n\u201CMy experience is that you care only about wars and the art of killing.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd what have you seen of us besides our army?\u201D\r\n\u201CNot much,\u201D Sigzil admitted.\r\n\u201CSo, a man of education,\u201D Kaladin said thoughtfully. \u201CIn a bridge crew.\u201D\r\n\u201CMy education was never completed.\u201D\r\n\u201CNeither was mine.\u201D\r\nSigzil looked at him, curious.\r\n\u201CI apprenticed as a surgeon,\u201D Kaladin said.\r\nSigzil nodded, thick dark hair falling around his shoulders. He\u2019d been one of the only bridgemen who bothered shaving. Now that Rock had a razor, maybe that would change. \u201CA surgeon,\u201D he said. \u201CI cannot say that is surprising, considering how you handled the wounded. The men say that you\u2019re secretly a lighteyes of very high rank.\u201D\r\n\u201C\r\nWhat?But my eyes are dark brown!\u201D\r\n\u201CPardon me,\u201D Sigzil said. \u201CI didn\u2019t speak the right word\u2014you don\u2019t\r\nhavethe right word in your language. To you, a lighteyes is the same as a leader. In other kingdoms, though, other things make a man a\u2026curse this Alethi language. A man of high birth. A brightlord, only without the eyes. Anyway, the men think you must have been raised outside of Alethkar. As a leader.\u201D\r\nSigzil looked back at the others. They were beginning to sit back down, attacking their stew with vigor. \u201CIt\u2019s the way you lead so naturally, the way you make others want to listen to you. These are things they associate with lighteyes. And so they have invented a past for you. You will have a difficult time disabusing them of it now.\u201D Sigzil eyed him. \u201CAssuming it is a fabrication. I was there in the chasm the day you used that spear.\u201D\r\n\u201CA spear,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CA darkeyed soldier\u2019s weapon, not a lighteyes\u2019s sword.\u201D\r\n\u201CTo many bridgemen, the difference is minimal. All are so far above us.\u201D\r\n\u201CSo what is your story?\u201D\r\nSigzil smirked. \u201CI wondered if you were going to ask. The others mentioned that you have pried into their origins.\u201D\r\n\u201CI like to know the men I lead.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd if some of us are murderers?\u201D Sigzil asked quietly.\r\n\u201CThen I\u2019m in good company,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CIf it was a lighteyes you killed, then I might buy you a drink.\u201D\r\n\u201CNot a lighteyes,\u201D Sigzil said. \u201CAnd he is not dead.\u201D\r\n\u201CThen you\u2019re not a murderer,\u201D Kaladin said.\r\n\u201CNot for want of trying.\u201D Sigzil\u2019s eyes grew distant. \u201CI thought for certain I had succeeded. It was not the wisest choice I made. My master\u2026\u201D He trailed off.\r\n\u201CIs he the one you tried to kill?\u201D\r\n\u201CNo.\u201D\r\nKaladin waited, but no more information was forthcoming.\r\nA scholar,he thought.\r\nOr at least a man of learning. There has to be a way to use this.\r\nFind a way out of this death trap, Kaladin. Use what you have. Therehas\r\nto be a way.\r\n\u201CYou were right about the bridgemen,\u201D Sigzil said. \u201CWe are sent to die. It is the only reasonable explanation. There is a place in the world. Marabethia. Have you heard of it?\u201D\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D Kaladin said.\r\n\u201CIt is beside the sea, to the north, in the Selay lands. The people are known for their great fondness for debate. At each intersection in the city they have small pedestals on which a man can stand and proclaim his arguments. It is said that everyone in Marabethia carries a pouch with an overripe fruit just in case they pass a proclaimer with whom they disagree.\u201D\r\nKaladin frowned. He hadn\u2019t heard so many words from Sigzil in all the time they\u2019d been bridgemen together.\r\n\u201CWhat you said earlier, on the plateau,\u201D Sigzil continued, eyes forward, \u201Cit made me think of the Marabethians. You see, they have a curious way of treating condemned criminals. They dangle them over the seaside cliff near the city, down near the water at high tide, with a cut sliced in each cheek. There is a particular species of greatshell in the depths there. The creatures are known for their succulent flavor, and of course they have gemhearts. Not nearly as large as the ones in these chasmfiends, but still nice. So the criminals, they become bait. A criminal may demand execution instead, but they say if you hang there for a week and are not eaten, then you can go free.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd does that often happen?\u201D Kaladin asked.\r\nSigzil shook his head. \u201CNever. But the prisoners almost always take the chance. The Marabethians have a saying for someone who refuses to see the truth of a situation. \u2018You have eyes of red and blue,\u2019 they say. Red for the blood dripping. Blue for the water. It is said that these two things are all the prisoners see. Usually they are attacked within one day. And yet, most still wish to take that chance. They prefer the false hope.\u201D\r\nEyes of red and blue,Kaladin thought, imagining the morbid picture.\r\n\u201CYou do a good work,\u201D Sigzil said, rising, picking up his bowl. \u201CAt first, I hated you for lying to the men. But I have come to see that a false hope makes them happy. What you do is like giving medicine to a sick man to ease his pain until he dies. Now these men can spend their last days in laughter. You are a healer indeed, Kaladin Stormblessed.\u201D\r\nKaladin wanted to object, to say that it wasn\u2019t a false hope, but he couldn\u2019t. Not with his heart in his stomach. Not with what he knew.\r\nA moment later, Rock burst from the barrack. \u201CI feel like a true\r\nalil\u2019tiki\u2019iagain!\u201D he proclaimed, holding aloft his razor. \u201CMy friends, you cannot know what you have done! Someday, I will take you to the Peaks and show you the hospitality of kings!\u201D\r\nDespite all of his complaining, he hadn\u2019t shaved his beard off completely. He had left long, red-blond sideburns, which curved down to his chin. The tip of the chin itself was shaved clean, as were his lips. On the tall, oval-faced man, the look was quite distinctive. \u201CHa!\u201D Rock said, striding up to the fire. He grabbed the nearest men there and hugged them both to him, causing Bisig to nearly spill his stew. \u201CI will make you all family for this. A peak dweller\u2019s\r\nhumaka\u2019abanis his pride! I feel like a true man again. Here. This razor belongs not to me, but to us all. Any who wishes to use it must do so. Is my honor to share with you!\u201D\r\nThe men laughed, and a few took him up on the offer. Kaladin wasn\u2019t one of them. It just\u2026didn\u2019t seem to matter to him. He accepted the bowl of stew Dunny brought him, but didn\u2019t eat. Sigzil chose not to sit back down beside him, retreating to the other side of the campfire.\r\nEyes of red and blue,Kaladin thought.\r\nI don\u2019t know if that fits us.For him to have eyes of red and blue, Kaladin would have to believe that there was at least a small chance the bridge crew could survive. This night, Kaladin had trouble convincing himself.\r\nHe\u2019d never been an optimist. He saw the world as it was, or he tried to. That was a problem, though, when the truth he saw was so terrible.\r\nOh, Stormfather,he thought, feeling the crushing weight of despair as he stared down at his bowl.\r\nI\u2019m falling back to the wretch I was. I\u2019m losing my grip on this, on myself.\r\nHe couldn\u2019t carry the hopes of all the bridgemen.\r\nHe just wasn\u2019t strong enough."

      "ChapterName": "41: OF ALDS AND MILP",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\nFIVE AND A HALF YEARS AGO\r\nKaladin pushed past the shrieking Laral and stumbled into the surgery room. Even after years working with his father, the amount of blood in the room was shocking. It was as if someone had dumped out a bucket of bright red paint.\r\nThe scent of burned flesh hung in the air. Lirin worked frantically on Brightlord Rillir, Roshone\u2019s son. An evil-looking, tusklike thing jutted from the young man\u2019s abdomen, and his lower right leg was crushed. It hung by only a few tendons, splinters of bone poking out like reeds from the waters of a pond. Brightlord Roshone himself lay on the side table, groaning, eyes squeezed shut as he held his leg, which was pierced by another of the bony spears. Blood leaked from his improvised bandage, flowed down the side of the table, and dripped to the floor to mix with his son\u2019s.\r\nKaladin stood in the doorway gaping. Laral continued to scream. She clutched the doorframe as several of Roshone\u2019s guards tried to pull her away. Her wails were frantic. \u201CDo something! Work harder! He can\u2019t! He was where it happened and I don\u2019t care and let me go!\u201D The garbled phrases degenerated into screeches. The guards finally got her away.\r\n\u201CKaladin!\u201D his father snapped. \u201CI need you!\u201D\r\nShocked into motion, Kaladin entered the room, scrubbing his hands then gathering bandages from the cabinet, stepping in blood. He caught a\u00A0glimpse of Rillir\u2019s face; much of the skin on the right side had been scraped off. The eyelid was gone, the blue eye itself sliced open at the front, deflated like the skin of a grape pressed for wine.\r\nKaladin hastened to his father with the bandages. His mother appeared at the doorway a moment later, Tien behind her. She raised a hand to her mouth, then pulled Tien away. He stumbled, looking woozy. She returned in a moment without him.\r\n\u201CWater, Kaladin!\u201D Lirin cried. \u201CHesina, fetch more. Quickly!\u201D\r\nHis mother jumped to help, though she rarely assisted in the surgery anymore. Her hands shook as she grabbed one of the buckets and ran outside. Kaladin took the other bucket, which was full, to his father as Lirin eased the length of bone from the young lighteyes\u2019s gut. Rillir\u2019s remaining eye fluttered, head quivering.\r\n\u201CWhat\r\nisthat?\u201D Kaladin asked, pressing the bandage to the wound as his father tossed the strange object aside.\r\n\u201CWhitespine tusk,\u201D his father said. \u201CWater.\u201D\r\nKaladin grabbed a sponge, dunked it in the bucket, and used it to squeeze water into Rillir\u2019s gut wound. That washed away the blood, giving Lirin a good look at the damage. He quested with his fingers as Kaladin got some needle and thread ready. There was already a tourniquet on the leg. Full amputation would come later.\r\nLirin hesitated, fingers inside the gaping hole in Rillir\u2019s belly. Kaladin cleaned the wound again. He looked up at his father, concerned.\r\nLirin pulled his fingers out and walked to Brightlord Roshone. \u201CBandages, Kaladin,\u201D he said curtly.\r\nKaladin hurried over, though he shot a look over his shoulder at Rillir. The once-handsome young lighteyes trembled again, spasming. \u201CFather\u2026\u201D\r\n\u201CBandages!\u201D Lirin said.\r\n\u201CWhat are you doing, surgeon?\u201D Roshone bellowed. \u201CWhat of my son?\u201D Painspren swarmed around him.\r\n\u201CYour son is dead,\u201D Lirin said, yanking the tusk free from Roshone\u2019s leg.\r\nThe lighteyes bellowed in agony, though Kaladin couldn\u2019t tell if that was because of the tusk or his son. Roshone clenched his jaw as Kaladin pressed the bandage down on his leg. Lirin dunked his hands in the water bucket, then quickly wiped them with knobweed sap to frighten off rotspren.\r\n\u201CMy son\r\nis not dead,\u201D Roshone growled. \u201CI can see him moving! Tend to him, surgeon.\u201D\r\n\u201CKaladin, get the dazewater,\u201D Lirin ordered gathering his sewing needle.\r\nKaladin hurried to the back of the room, steps splashing blood, and threw open the far cupboard. He took out a small flask of clear liquid.\r\n\u201CWhat are you doing?\u201D Roshone bellowed, trying to sit up. \u201CLook at my son! Almighty above,\r\nlookat him!\u201D\r\nKaladin turned hesitantly, pausing as he poured dazewater on a bandage. Rillir was spasming more violently.\r\n\u201CI work under three guidelines, Roshone,\u201D Lirin said, forcibly pressing the lighteyes down against his table. \u201CThe guidelines every surgeon uses when choosing between two patients. If the wounds are equal, treat the youngest first.\u201D\r\n\u201CThen see to my son!\u201D\r\n\u201CIf the wounds are not equally threatening,\u201D Lirin continued, \u201Ctreat the worst wound first.\u201D\r\n\u201CAs I\u2019ve been\r\ntelling you!\u201D\r\n\u201CThe third guideline supersedes them both, Roshone,\u201D Lirin said, leaning down. \u201CA surgeon must know when someone is beyond their ability to help. I\u2019m sorry, Roshone. I would save him if I could, I promise you. But I cannot.\u201D\r\n\u201CNo!\u201D Roshone said, struggling again.\r\n\u201CKaladin! Quickly!\u201D Lirin said.\r\nKaladin dashed over. He pressed the bandage of dazewater to Roshone\u2019s chin and mouth, just below the nose, forcing the lighteyed man to breathe the fumes. Kaladin held his own breath, as he\u2019d been trained.\r\nRoshone bellowed and screamed, but the two of them held him down, and he was weak from blood loss. Soon, his bellows became softer. In seconds, he was speaking in gibberish and grinning to himself. Lirin turned back to the leg wound while Kaladin went to throw away the dazewater bandage.\r\n\u201CNo. Administer it to Rillir.\u201D His father didn\u2019t look away from his work. \u201CIt\u2019s the only mercy we can give him.\u201D\r\nKaladin nodded and used the dazewater bandage on the wounded youth. Rillir\u2019s breathing grew less frantic, though he didn\u2019t seem conscious enough to notice the effects. Then Kaladin threw the bandage with the dazewater into the brazier; heat negated the effects. The white, puffy bandage wrinkled and browned in the fire, steam streaming off it as the edges burst into flame.\r\nKaladin returned with the sponge and washed out Roshone\u2019s wound as Lirin prodded at it. There were a few shards of tusk trapped inside, and Lirin muttered to himself, getting out his tongs and razor-sharp knife.\r\n\u201CDamnation can take them all,\u201D Lirin said, pulling out the first sliver of tusk. Behind him, Rillir fell still. \u201CIsn\u2019t sending half of us to war enough for them? Do they have to seek death even when they\u2019re living in a quiet township? Roshone should never have gone looking for the storming whitespine.\u201D\r\n\u201CHe was\r\nlookingfor it?\u201D\r\n\u201CThey went hunting it,\u201D Lirin spat. \u201CWistiow and I used to joke about lighteyes like them. If you can\u2019t kill men, you kill beasts. Well, this is what you found, Roshone.\u201D\r\n\u201CFather,\u201D Kaladin said softly. \u201CHe\u2019s not going to be pleased with you when he awakes.\u201D The brightlord was humming softly, lying back, eyes closed.\r\nLirin didn\u2019t respond. He yanked out another fragment of tusk, and Kaladin washed out the wound. His father pressed his fingers to the side of the large puncture, inspecting it.\r\nThere was one more sliver of tusk, jutting from a muscle inside the wound. Right beside that muscle thumped the femoral artery, the largest in the leg. Lirin reached in with his knife, carefully cutting free the sliver of tusk. Then he paused for a moment, the edge of his blade just hairs from the artery.\r\nIf that were cut\u2026Kaladin thought. Roshone would be dead in minutes. He was only alive right now because the tusk had missed the artery.\r\nLirin\u2019s normally steady hand quivered. Then he glanced up at Kaladin. He withdrew the knife without touching the artery, then reached in with his tongs to pull the sliver free. He tossed it aside, then calmly reached for his thread and needle.\r\nBehind them, Rillir had stopped breathing.\r\nThat evening, Kaladin sat on the steps to his house, hands in his lap.\r\nRoshone had been returned to his estate to be cared for by his personal servants. His son\u2019s corpse was cooling in the crypt below, and a messenger had been sent to request a Soulcaster for the body.\r\nOn the horizon, the sun was red as blood. Everywhere Kaladin looked, the world was red.\r\nThe door to the surgery closed, and his father\u2014looking as exhausted as Kaladin felt\u2014tottered out. He eased himself down, sighing as he sat beside Kaladin, looking at the sun. Did it look like blood to him too?\r\nThey didn\u2019t speak as the sun slowly sank before them. Why was it most colorful when it was about to vanish for the night? Was it angry at being forced belong the horizon? Or was it a showman, giving a performance before retiring?\r\nWhy was the most colorful part of people\u2019s bodies\u2014the brightness of their blood\u2014hidden beneath the skin, never to be seen unless something went wrong?\r\nNo,Kaladin thought.\r\nThe blood isn\u2019t the most colorful part of a body. The eyes can be colorful too.The blood and the eyes. Both representations of one\u2019s heritage. And one\u2019s nobility.\r\n\u201CI saw inside a man today,\u201D Kaladin finally said.\r\n\u201CNot for the first time,\u201D Lirin said, \u201Cand certainly not for the last. I\u2019m proud of you. I expected to find you here crying, as you usually do when we lose a patient. You\u2019re learning.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhen I said I saw inside a man,\u201D Kaladin said, \u201CI wasn\u2019t talking about the wounds.\u201D\r\nLirin didn\u2019t respond for a moment. \u201CI see.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou would have let him die if I hadn\u2019t been there, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201D\r\nSilence.\r\n\u201CWhy didn\u2019t you?\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CIt would have solved so much!\u201D\r\n\u201CIt wouldn\u2019t have been letting him die. It would have been murdering him.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou could have just let him bleed, then claimed you couldn\u2019t save him. Nobody would have questioned you. You\r\ncouldhave done it.\u201D\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D Lirin said, staring at the sunset. \u201CNo, I couldn\u2019t have.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut why?\u201D\r\n\u201CBecause I\u2019m not a killer, son.\u201D\r\nKaladin frowned.\r\nLirin had a distant look in his eyes. \u201CSomebody has to start. Somebody has to step forward and do what is right,\r\nbecauseit is right. If nobody starts, then others cannot follow. The lighteyes do their best to kill themselves, and to kill us. The others still haven\u2019t brought back Alds and Milp. Roshone just left them there.\u201D\r\nAlds and Milp, two townsmen, had been on the hunt but hadn\u2019t returned with the party bearing the two wounded lighteyes. Roshone had been so worried about Rillir that he\u2019d left them behind so he could travel quickly.\r\n\u201CThe lighteyes don\u2019t care about life,\u201D Lirin said. \u201CSo I must. That\u2019s another reason why I wouldn\u2019t have let Roshone die, even if you hadn\u2019t been there. Though looking at you did strengthen me.\u201D\r\n\u201CI wish it hadn\u2019t,\u201D Kaladin said.\r\n\u201CYou mustn\u2019t say such things.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhy not?\u201D\r\n\u201CBecause, son. We have to be\r\nbetterthan they are.\u201D He sighed, standing. \u201CYou should sleep. I may need you when the others return with Alds and Milp.\u201D\r\nThat wasn\u2019t likely; the two townsmen were probably dead by now. Their wounds were said to be pretty bad. Plus, the whitespines were still out there.\r\nLirin went inside, but didn\u2019t compel Kaladin to follow.\r\nWould I have let him die?Kaladin wondered.\r\nMaybe even flicked that knife to hasten him on his way?Roshone had been nothing but a blight since his arrival, but did that justify killing him?\r\nNo. Cutting that artery wouldn\u2019t have been justified. But what obligation had Kaladin to help? Withholding his aid wasn\u2019t the same thing as killing. It just\r\nwasn\u2019t.\r\nKaladin thought it through a dozen different ways, pondering his father\u2019s words. What he found shocked him. He honestly would have let Roshone die on that table. It would have been better for Kaladin\u2019s family; it would have been better for the entire town.\r\nKaladin\u2019s father had once laughed at his son\u2019s desire to go to war. Indeed, now that Kaladin had decided he would become a surgeon on his own terms, his thoughts and actions of earlier years felt childish to him. But Lirin thought Kaladin incapable of killing.\r\nYou can hardly step on a cremling without feeling guilty, son,he\u2019d said.\r\nRamming your spear into a man would be nowhere near as easy as you seem to think.\r\nBut his father was wrong. It was a stunning, frightening revelation. This wasn\u2019t idle fancy or daydreaming about the glory of battle. This was real.\r\nAt that moment, Kaladin knew he\r\ncouldkill, if he needed to. Some people\u2014like a festering finger or a leg shattered beyond repair\u2014just needed to be removed."

In an unusual moment of deference, she put aside her books and sat with her back to the Veil, regarding Shallan. \u201CVery well.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat you did was both legal and right, in the strict sense of the words,\u201D Shallan said. \u201CBut it was not moral, and it\r\ncertainlywasn\u2019t ethical.\u201D\r\n\u201CSo morality and legality are distinct?\u201D\r\n\u201CNearly all of the philosophies agree they are.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut what do\r\nyouthink?\u201D\r\nShallan hesitated. \u201CYes. You can be moral without following the law, and you can be immoral while following the law.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut you also said what I did was \u2018right\u2019 but not \u2018moral.\u2019 The distinction between those two seems less easy to define.\u201D\r\n\u201CAn action can be right,\u201D Shallan said. \u201CIt is simply something done, viewed without considering intent. Killing four men in self-defense is right.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut not moral?\u201D\r\n\u201CMorality applies to your intent and the greater context of the situation. Seeking out men to kill is an immoral act, Jasnah, regardless of the eventual outcome.\u201D\r\nJasnah tapped her desktop with a fingernail. She was wearing her glove, the gemstones of the broken Soulcaster bulging beneath. It had been two weeks. Surely she\u2019d discovered that it didn\u2019t work. How could she be so calm?\r\nWas she trying to fix it in secret? Perhaps she feared that if she revealed it was broken, she would lose political power. Or had she realized that hers had been swapped for a different Soulcaster? Could it be, despite all odds, that Jasnah just hadn\u2019t tried to use the Soulcaster? Shallan needed to leave before too long. But if she left before Jasnah discovered the swap, she risked having the woman try her Soulcaster just after Shallan vanished, bringing suspicion directly on her. The anxious waiting was driving Shallan near to madness.\r\nFinally, Jasnah nodded, then returned to her research.\r\n\u201CYou have nothing to say?\u201D Shallan said. \u201CI just accused you of murder.\u201D\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D Jasnah said, \u201Cmurder is a legal definition. You said I killed unethically.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou think I\u2019m wrong, I assume?\u201D\r\n\u201CYou are,\u201D Jasnah said. \u201CBut I accept that you believe what you are saying and have put rational thought behind it. I have looked over your notes, and I believe you understand the various philosophies. In some cases, I think that you were quite insightful in your interpretation of them. The lesson was instructive.\u201D She opened her book.\r\n\u201CThen that\u2019s it?\u201D\r\n\u201COf course not,\u201D Jasnah said. \u201CWe will study philosophy further in the future; for now, I\u2019m satisfied that you have established a solid foundation in the topic.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut I still decided you were wrong. I still think there\u2019s an absolute Truth out there.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D Jasnah said, \u201Cand it took you two weeks of struggling to come to that conclusion.\u201D Jasnah looked up, meeting Shallan\u2019s eyes. \u201CIt wasn\u2019t easy, was it?\u201D\r\n\u201CNo.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd you still wonder, don\u2019t you?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes.\r\n\u201CThat is enough.\u201D Jasnah narrowed her eyes slightly, a consoling smile appearing on her lips. \u201CIf it helps you wrestle with your feelings, child, understand that I\r\nwastrying to do good. I sometimes wonder if I should accomplish more with my Soulcaster.\u201D She turned back to her reading. \u201CYou are free for the rest of the day.\u201D\r\nShallan blinked. \u201CWhat?\u201D\r\n\u201CFree,\u201D Jasnah said. \u201CYou may go. Do as you please. You\u2019ll spend it drawing beggars and barmaids, I suspect, but you may choose. Be off with you.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes, Brightness! Thank you.\u201D\r\nJasnah waved in dismissal and Shallan grabbed her portfolio and hastened from the alcove. She hadn\u2019t had any free time since the day she\u2019d gone sketching on her own in the gardens. She\u2019d been gently chided for that; Jasnah had left her in her rooms to rest, not go out sketching.\r\nShallan waited impatiently as the parshman porters lowered her lift to the Veil\u2019s groundfloor, then hurried out into the cavernous central hall. A long walk later, she approached the guest quarters, nodding to the master-servants who served there. Half guards, half concierges, they monitored who entered and left.\r\nShe used her thick brass key to unlock the door to Jasnah\u2019s rooms, then slipped inside and locked the door behind her. The small sitting chamber\u2014furnished with a rug and two chairs beside the hearth\u2014was lit by topazes. The table still contained a half-full cup of orange wine from Jasnah\u2019s late research the night before, along with a few crumbs of bread on a plate.\r\nShallan hurried to her own chamber, then shut the door and took the Soulcaster out of her safepouch. The warm glow of the gemstones bathed her face in white and red light. They were large enough\u2014and therefore bright enough\u2014that it was hard to look at them directly. Each would be worth ten or twenty broams.\r\nShe\u2019d been forced to hide them outside in the recent highstorm to infuse them, and that had been its own source of anxiety. She took a deep breath, then knelt and slid a small wooden stick from under the bed. A week and a half of practice, and she still hadn\u2019t managed to make the Soulcaster do\u2026well, anything at all. She\u2019d tried tapping the gems, twisting them, shaking her hand, and flexing her hand in exact mimicry of Jasnah. She\u2019d studied picture after picture she\u2019d drawn of the process. She tried speaking, concentrating, and even begging.\r\nHowever, she\u2019d found a book the day before that had offered what seemed like a useful tip. It claimed that humming, of all things, could make a Soulcasting more effective. It was just a passing reference, but it was more than she\u2019d found anywhere else. She sat down on her bed and forced herself to concentrate. She closed her eyes, holding the stick, imagining it transforming into quartz. Then she began humming.\r\nNothing happened. She kept on humming though, trying different notes, concentrating as hard as she could. She kept her attention on the task for a good half hour, but eventually her mind began to wander. A new worry began to nibble at her. Jasnah was one of the most brilliant, insightful scholars in the world. She\u2019d put the Soulcaster out where it could be taken. Had she intentionally duped Shallan with a fake?\r\nIt seemed an awful lot of trouble to go through. Why not just spring the trap and reveal Shallan as a thief? The fact that she couldn\u2019t get the Soulcaster to work left her straining plausibility for explanations.\r\nShe stopped humming and opened her eyes. The stick had not changed.\r\nSo much for that tip,she thought, setting the stick aside with a sigh. She\u2019d been so hopeful.\r\nShe lay back on the bed, resting, staring up at the brown stone ceiling, cut\u2014like the rest of the Conclave\u2014directly out of the mountain. Here, the stone had been left intentionally rough, evoking the roof of a cave. It was quite beautiful in a subtle way she\u2019d never noticed before, the colors and contours of the rock rippling like a disturbed pond.\r\nShe took a sheet from her portfolio and began to sketch the rock patterns. One sketch to calm her, and then she would get back to the Soulcaster. Perhaps she should try it on her other hand again.\r\nShe couldn\u2019t capture the colors of the strata, not in charcoal, but she could record the fascinating way the strata wove together. Like a work of art. Had some stoneworker cut this ceiling intentionally, crafting this subtle creation, or was it an accident of nature? She smiled, imagining some overworked stonecutter noticing the beautiful grain of the rock and deciding to form a wave pattern for his own personal wonder and sense of beauty.\r\n\u201CWhat are you?\u201D\r\nShallan yelped, sitting up, sketchpad bouncing free of her lap. Someone had whispered those words. She\u2019d heard them distinctly!\r\n\u201CWho is there?\u201D she asked.\r\nSilence.\r\n\u201CWho\u2019s there!\u201D she said more loudly, her heart beating quickly.\r\nSomething sounded outside her door, from the sitting room. Shallan jumped, hiding the hand wearing the Soulcaster under a pillow as the door creaked open, revealing a wizened palace maid, darkeyed and dressed in a white and black uniform.\r\n\u201COh dear!\u201D the woman exclaimed. \u201CI had no idea you were here, Brightness.\u201D She bowed low.\r\nA palace maid. Here to clean the room, an everyday occurrence. Focused on her meditation, Shallan hadn\u2019t heard her enter. \u201CWhy did you speak to me?\u201D\r\n\u201CSpeak to you, Brightness?\u201D\r\n\u201CYou\u2026\u201D No, the voice had been a whisper, and it had quite distinctly come from\r\ninsideShallan\u2019s room. It couldn\u2019t have been the maid.\r\nShe shivered and glanced about. But that was foolish. The tiny room was easily inspected. There were no Voidbringers hiding in the corners or under her bed.\r\nWhat, then, had she heard?\r\nNoises from the woman cleaning, obviously.Shallan\u2019s mind had just interpreted those random sounds as words.\r\nForcing herself to relax, Shallan looked out past the maid into the sitting room. The woman had cleaned up the wineglass and crumbs. A broom leaned against the wall. In addition, Jasnah\u2019s door was cracked open. \u201CWere you in Brightness Jasnah\u2019s room?\u201D Shallan demanded.\r\n\u201CYes, Brightness,\u201D the woman said. \u201CTidying up the desk, making the bed\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CBrightness Jasnah does\r\nnotlike people entering her room. The maids have been told not to clean in there.\u201D The king had promised that his maids were very carefully chosen, and there had never been issues of theft, but Jasnah still insisted that none enter her bedchamber.\r\nThe woman paled. \u201CI\u2019m sorry, Brightness. I didn\u2019t hear! I wasn\u2019t told\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CHush, it\u2019s all right,\u201D Shallan said. \u201CYou\u2019ll want to go tell her what you\u2019ve done. She always notices if her things were moved. It will be better for you if you go to her and explain.\u201D\r\n\u201CY-Yes, Brightness.\u201D The woman bowed again.\r\n\u201CIn fact,\u201D Shallan said, something occurring to her. \u201CYou should go now. No point putting it off.\u201D\r\nThe elderly maid sighed. \u201CYes, of course, Brightness.\u201D She withdrew. A few seconds later, the outside door closed and locked.\r\nShallan leapt up, pulling off the Soulcaster and stuffing it back in her safepouch. She hurried outside, heart thumping, the strange voice forgotten as she seized the opportunity to look into Jasnah\u2019s room. It was unlikely that Shallan would discover anything useful about the Soulcaster, but she couldn\u2019t pass up the chance\u2014not with the maid to blame for moving things.\r\nShe felt only a glimmer of guilt for this. She\u2019d already stolen from Jasnah. Compared with that, poking through her room was nothing.\r\nThe bedroom was larger than Shallan\u2019s, though it still felt cramped because of the unavoidable lack of windows. Jasnah\u2019s bed, a four-poster monstrosity, took up half the space. The vanity was against the far wall, and beside it the dressing table from which Shallan had originally stolen the Soulcaster. Other than a dresser, the only other thing in the room was the desk, books piled high on the left side.\r\nShallan never got a chance to look at Jasnah\u2019s notebooks. Might she, perhaps, have taken notes on the Soulcaster? Shallan sat at the desk, hurriedly pulling open the top drawer and poking through the brushpens, charcoal pencils, and sheets of paper. All were organized neatly, and the paper was blank. The bottom right drawer held ink and empty notebooks. The bottom left drawer had a small collection of reference books.\r\nThat left the books on the top of the table. Jasnah would have the majority of her notebooks with her as she worked. But\u2026yes, there were still a few here. Heart fluttering, Shallan gathered up the three thin volumes and set them before her.\r\nNotes on Urithiru, the first one declared inside. The notebook was full\u2014it appeared\u2014of quotes from and notations about various books Jasnah had found. All spoke of this place, Urithiru. Jasnah had mentioned it earlier to Kabsal.\r\nShallan put that book aside, looking at the next, hoping for mention of the Soulcaster. This notebook was also filled to capacity, but there was no title on it. Shallan picked through, reading some entries.\r\n\u201CThe ones of ash and fire, who killed like a swarm, relentless before the Heralds\u2026\u201D Noted in Masly, page 337. Corroborated by Coldwin and Hasavah.\r\n\u201CThey take away the light, wherever they lurk. Skin that is burned.\u201D Cormshen, page 104.\r\nInnia, in her recordings of children\u2019s folktales, speaks of the Voidbringers as being \u201CLike a highstorm, regular in their coming, yet always unexpected.\u201D The word Desolation is used twice in reference to their appearances. See pages 57, 59, and 64 ofTales by Hearthlight.\r\n\u201CThey changed, even as we fought them. Like shadows they were, that can transform as the flame dances. Never underestimate them because of what you first see.\u201D Purports to be a scrap collected from Talatin, a Radiant of the Order of Stonewards. The source\u2014Guvlow\u2019sIncarnate\u2014\r\nis generally held as reliable, though this is from a copied fragment ofThe Poem of the Seventh Morning,\r\nwhich has been lost.\r\nThey went on like that. Pages and pages. Jasnah had trained her in this method of note taking\u2014once the notebook was filled, each item would be evaluated again for reliability and usefulness and copied to different, more specific notebooks.\r\nFrowning, Shallan looked through the final notebook. It focused on Natanatan, the Unclaimed Hills, and the Shattered Plains. It collected records of discoveries by hunters, explorers, or tradesmen searching for a river passage to New Natanan. Of the three notebooks, the largest was the one that focused on the Voidbringers.\r\nThe Voidbringers again. Many people in more rural places whispered of them and other monsters of the dark. The raspings, or stormwhispers, or even the dreaded nightspren. Shallan had been taught by stern tutors that these were superstition, fabrications of the Lost Radiants, who used tales of monsters to justify their domination of mankind.\r\nThe ardents taught something else. They spoke of the Lost Radiants\u2014called the Knights Radiant then\u2014fighting off Voidbringers during the war to hold Roshar. According to these teachings, it was only after defeating the Voidbringers\u2014and the departure of the Heralds\u2014that the Radiants had fallen.\r\nBoth groups agreed that the Voidbringers were gone. Fabrications or long-defeated enemies, the result was the same. Shallan could believe that some people\u2014some scholars, even\u2014might believe that the Voidbringers still existed, haunting mankind. But Jasnah the skeptic? Jasnah, who denied the existence of the Almighty? Could the woman really be so twisted as to deny the existence of God, but\r\nacceptthe existence of his mythological enemies?\r\nA knock came at the outer door. Shallan jumped, raising her hand to her breast. She hurriedly replaced the notebooks on the desk in the same order and orientation. Then, flustered, she hurried out to the door.\r\nJasnah wouldn\u2019t knock, you silly fool,she told herself, unlocking and opening the door a crack.\r\nKabsal stood outside. The handsome, lighteyed ardent held up a basket. \u201CI\u2019ve heard reports that you have the day free.\u201D He shook the basket temptingly. \u201CWould you like some jam?\u201D\r\nShallan calmed herself, then glanced back at Jasnah\u2019s open quarters. She really should investigate more. She turned to Kabsal, meaning to tell him no, but his eyes were so inviting. That hint of a smile on his face, that good-natured and relaxed posture.\r\nIf Shallan went with Kabsal, maybe she could ask him what he knew regarding Soulcasters. That wasn\u2019t what decided it for her, however, The truth was, she\r\nneededto relax. She\u2019d been so on edge lately, brain stuffed with philosophy, every spare moment spent trying to make the Soulcaster work. Was it any wonder she was hearing voices?\r\n\u201CI\u2019d love some jam,\u201D she declared.\r\n\u201CTruthberry jam,\u201D Kabsal said, holding up the small green jar. \u201CIt\u2019s Azish. Legends there say that those who consume the berries speak only the truth until the next sunset.\u201D\r\nShallan raised an eyebrow. They were seated on cushions atop a blanket in the Conclave gardens, not far from where she\u2019d first experimented with the Soulcaster. \u201CAnd is it true?\u201D\r\n\u201CHardly,\u201D Kabsal said, opening the jar. \u201CThe berries are harmless. But the leaves and stalks of the truthberry plant, if burned, give off a smoke that makes people intoxicated and euphoric. It appears that peoples often gathered the stalks for making fires. They\u2019d eat the berries around the campfire and have a rather\u2026interesting night.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s a wonder\u2014\u201D Shallan began, then bit her lip.\r\n\u201CWhat?\u201D he prodded.\r\nShe sighed. \u201CIt\u2019s a wonder they didn\u2019t become known as birthberries, considering\u2014\u201D She blushed.\r\nHe laughed. \u201CThat\u2019s a good point!\u201D\r\n\u201CStormfather,\u201D she said, blushing further. \u201CI\u2019m terrible at being proper. Here, give me some of that jam.\u201D\r\nHe smiled, handing over a slice of bread with green jam slathered across the top. A dull-eyed parshman\u2014appropriated from inside the Conclave\u2014sat on the ground beside a shalebark wall, acting as an impromptu chaperone. It felt so strange to be out with a man near her own age with only a single parshman in attendance. It felt liberating. Exhilarating. Or maybe that was just the sunlight and the open air.\r\n\u201CI\u2019m\r\nalsoterrible at being scholarly,\u201D she said, closing her eyes, breathing deeply. \u201CI like it outside far too much.\u201D\r\n\u201CMany of the greatest scholars spent their lives traveling.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd for each one of them,\u201D Shallan said, \u201Cthere were a hundred more stuck back in a hole of a library, buried in books.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd they wouldn\u2019t have had it any other way. Most people with a bent for research\r\nprefertheir holes and libraries. But you do not. That makes you intriguing.\u201D\r\nShe opened her eyes, smiling at him, then took a luscious bite of her jam and bread. This Thaylen bread was so fluffy, it was more like cake.\r\n\u201CSo,\u201D she said as he chewed on his bite, \u201Cdo you feel any more truthful, now that you\u2019ve had the jam?\u201D\r\n\u201CI am an ardent,\u201D he said. \u201CIt is my duty and calling to be truthful at all times.\u201D\r\n\u201COf course,\u201D she said. \u201CI\u2019m always truthful as well.\r\nSofull of truth, in fact, that sometimes it squeezes the lies right out my lips. There isn\u2019t a place for them inside, you see.\u201D\r\nHe laughed heartily. \u201CShallan Davar. I can\u2019t imagine anyone as sweet as yourself uttering a single untruth.\u201D\r\n\u201CThen for the sake of your sanity, I\u2019ll keep them coming in pairs.\u201D She smiled. \u201CI\u2019m having a terrible time, and this food is awful.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou\u2019ve just disproven an entire body of lore and mythology surrounding the eating of truthberry jam!\u201D\r\n\u201CGood,\u201D Shallan said. \u201CJam should not have lore or mythology. It should be sweet, colorful, and delicious.\u201D\r\n\u201CLike young ladies, I presume.\u201D\r\n\u201CBrother Kabsal!\u201D She blushed again. \u201CThat wasn\u2019t at\r\nallappropriate.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd yet you smile.\u201D\r\n\u201CI can\u2019t help it,\u201D she said. \u201CI\u2019m sweet, colorful, and delicious.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou have the colorful part right,\u201D he said, obviously amused at her deep blush. \u201CAnd the sweet part. Can\u2019t speak for your deliciousness\u2026.\u201D\r\n\u201CKabsal!\u201D she exclaimed, though she wasn\u2019t entirely shocked. She\u2019d once told herself that he was interested in her only in order to protect her soul, but that was getting more and more difficult to believe. He stopped by at least once a week.\r\nHe chuckled at her embarrassment, but that only made her blush further.\r\n\u201CStop it!\u201D She held her hand up in front of her eyes. \u201CMy face must be the color of my hair! You shouldn\u2019t say such things; you\u2019re a man of religion.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut still a man, Shallan.\u201D\r\n\u201COne who said his interest in me was only academic.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes, academic,\u201D he said idly. \u201CInvolving many experiments and much firsthand field research.\u201D\r\n\u201CKabsal!\u201D\r\nHe laughed deeply, taking a bite of his bread. \u201CI\u2019m sorry, Brightness Shallan. But it gets such a reaction!\u201D\r\nShe grumbled, lowering her hand, but knew that he said the things\u2014in part\u2014because she encouraged him. She couldn\u2019t help it. Nobody had ever shown her the kind of interest that he, increasingly, did. She liked him\u2014liked talking with him, liked listening to him. It was a wonderful way to break the monotony of study.\r\nThere was, of course, no prospect for a union. Assuming she could protect her family, she\u2019d be needed to make a good political marriage. Dallying with an ardent owned by the king of Kharbranth wouldn\u2019t serve anyone.\r\nI\u2019ll soon have to start hinting to him the truth,she thought.\r\nHe has to know that this won\u2019t go anywhere. Doesn\u2019t he?\r\nHe leaned toward her. \u201CYou really are what you seem, aren\u2019t you, Shallan?\u201D\r\n\u201CCapable? Intelligent? Charming?\u201D\r\nHe smiled. \u201CGenuine.\u201D\r\n\u201CI wouldn\u2019t say that,\u201D she said.\r\n\u201CYou are. I see it in you.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m genuine. I\u2019m naive. I lived my entire childhood in my family\u2019s manor.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou don\u2019t have the air of a recluse about you. You\u2019re so at ease at conversation.\u201D\r\n\u201CI had to become so. I spent most of my childhood in my own company, and I\r\ndetestboring conversation partners.\u201D\r\nHe smiled, though his eyes held concern. \u201CIt seems a shame that one such as you would lack for attention. That\u2019s like hanging a beautiful painting facing the wall.\u201D\r\nShe leaned back on her safehand, finishing off her bread. \u201CI wouldn\u2019t say I lacked for attention, not\r\nquantitatively, for certain. My father paid me plenty of attention.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve heard of him. A stern man, by reputation.\u201D\r\n\u201CHe\u2019s\u2026\u201D She had to pretend he was still alive. \u201CMy father is a man of passion and virtue. Just never at the same time.\u201D\r\n\u201CShallan! That might just be the wittiest thing I\u2019ve heard you say.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd perhaps the most truthful. Unfortunately.\u201D\r\nKabsal looked into her eyes, searching for something. What did he see? \u201CYou don\u2019t seem to care for your father much.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnother truthful statement. The berries are working on both of us, I see.\u201D\r\n\u201CHe\u2019s a hurtful man, I gather?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes, though never to me. I\u2019m too precious. His ideal, perfect daughter. You see, my father is\r\npreciselythe type of man to hang a picture facing the wrong way. That way, it can\u2019t be soiled by unworthy eyes or touched by unworthy fingers.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s a shame. As you look very touchable to me.\u201D\r\nShe glared. \u201CI told you, no more of that teasing.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat wasn\u2019t teasing,\u201D he said, regarding her with deep blue eyes. Earnest eyes. \u201CYou intrigue me, Shallan Davar.\u201D\r\nShe found her heart thumping. Oddly, a panic rose within her at the same time. \u201CI shouldn\u2019t be intriguing.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhy not?\u201D\r\n\u201CLogic puzzles are intriguing. Mathematical computations can be intriguing. Political maneuvers are intriguing. But women\u2026they should be nothing short of baffling.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd what if I think I\u2019m beginning to understand you?\u201D\r\n\u201CThen I\u2019m at a severe disadvantage,\u201D she said. \u201CAs I don\u2019t understand myself.\u201D\r\nHe smiled.\r\n\u201CWe shouldn\u2019t be talking like this, Kabsal. You\u2019re an ardent.\u201D\r\n\u201CA man can leave the ardentia, Shallan.\u201D\r\nShe felt a jolt. He looked steadily at her, not blinking. Handsome, soft-spoken, witty.\r\nThis could grow very dangerous very quickly,she thought.\r\n\u201CJasnah thinks you\u2019re getting close to me because you want her Soulcaster,\u201D Shallan blurted out. Then she winced.\r\nIdiot!That\u2019s\r\nyour response when a man hints that he might leave the service of the Almighty in order to be with you?\r\n\u201CBrightness Jasnah is quite clever,\u201D Kabsal said, slicing himself another piece of bread.\r\nShallan blinked. \u201COh, er. You mean she\u2019s\r\nright?\u201D\r\n\u201CRight and wrong,\u201D Kabsal said. \u201CThe devotary would very, very much like to get that fabrial. I planned to ask your help eventually.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut?\u201D\r\n\u201CBut my superiors thought it was a\r\nterribleidea.\u201D He grimaced. \u201CThey think the king of Alethkar is volatile enough that he\u2019d march to war with Kharbranth over that. Soulcasters aren\u2019t Shardblades, but they can be equally important.\u201D He shook his head, taking a bite of bread. \u201CElhokar Kholin should be ashamed to let his sister use that fabrial, particularly so trivially. But if we were to steal it\u2026Well, the repercussions could be felt across all of Vorin Roshar.\u201D\r\n\u201CIs that so?\u201D Shallan said, feeling sick.\r\nHe nodded. \u201CMost people don\u2019t think about it. I didn\u2019t. Kings rule and war with Shards\u2014but their armies subsist through Soulcasters. Do you have any idea the kinds of supply lines and support personnel Soulcasters replace? Without them, warfare is virtually\r\nimpossible. You\u2019d need hundreds of wagons filled with food every month!\u201D\r\n\u201CI guess\u2026that would be a problem.\u201D She took a deep breath. \u201CThey fascinate me, these Soulcasters. I\u2019ve always wondered what it would feel like to use one.\u201D\r\n\u201CI as well.\u201D\r\n\u201CSo you\u2019ve never used one?\u201D\r\nHe shook his head. \u201CThere aren\u2019t any in Kharbranth.\u201D\r\nRight,she thought.\r\nOf course. That\u2019s why the king needed Jasnah to help his granddaughter.\u201CHave you ever heard anyone talk about using one?\u201D She cringed at the bold statement. Would it make him suspicious?\r\nHe just nodded idly. \u201CThere\u2019s a secret to it, Shallan.\u201D\r\n\u201CReally?\u201D she asked, heart in her throat.\r\nHe looked up at her, seeming conspiratorial. \u201CIt\u2019s really not that difficult.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\u2026What?\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s true,\u201D he said. \u201CI\u2019ve heard it from several ardents. There\u2019s so much shadow and ritual surrounding Soulcasters. They\u2019re kept mysterious, aren\u2019t used where people can see. But the truth is, there\u2019s not much to them. You just put one on, press your hand against something, and tap a gemstone with your finger. It works that simply.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s not how Jasnah does it,\u201D she said, perhaps too defensively.\r\n\u201CYes, that confused me, but supposedly if you use one long enough, you learn how to control them better.\u201D He shook his head. \u201CI don\u2019t like the mystery that has grown up around them. It smells too much like the mysticism of the old Hierocracy. We\u2019d better not find ourselves treading down\r\nthatpath again. What would it matter if people knew how simple the Soulcasters are to use? The principles and gifts of the Almighty are often simple.\u201D\r\nShallan barely listened to that last part. Unfortunately, it seemed that Kabsal was as ignorant as she. More ignorant, even. She\u2019d tried the exact method he spoke of, and it didn\u2019t work. Perhaps the ardents he knew were lying to protect the secret.\r\n\u201CAnyway,\u201D Kabsal said, \u201CI guess that\u2019s a tangent. You asked me about stealing the Soulcaster, and rest assured, I wouldn\u2019t put you in that position. I was foolish to think of it, and I was shortly forbidden to attempt it. I\r\nwasordered to care for your soul and see that you weren\u2019t corrupted by Jasnah\u2019s teachings, and perhaps try to reclaim Jasnah\u2019s soul as well.\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, that last one is going to be difficult.\u201D\r\n\u201CI hadn\u2019t noticed,\u201D he replied dryly.\r\nShe smiled, though she couldn\u2019t quite decide how to feel. \u201CI kind of killed the moment, didn\u2019t I? Between us?\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m glad you did,\u201D he said, dusting off his hands. \u201CI get carried away, Shallan. At times, I wonder if I\u2019m as bad at being an ardent as you are at being proper. I don\u2019t want to be presumptuous. It\u2019s just that the way you speak, it gets my mind churning, and my tongue starts saying whatever comes to it.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd so\u2026\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd so we should call it a day,\u201D Kabsal said, standing. \u201CI need time to think.\u201D\r\nShallan stood as well, holding out her freehand for his assistance; standing up in a sleek Vorin dress was difficult. They were in a section of the gardens where the shalebark wasn\u2019t quite so high, so once standing, Shallan could see that the king himself was passing nearby, chatting with a middle-aged ardent who had a long, narrow face.\r\nThe king often went strolling through the gardens on his midday walk. She waved to him, but the kindly man didn\u2019t see her. He was deep in conversation with the ardent. Kabsal turned, noticed the king, then ducked down.\r\n\u201CWhat?\u201D Shallan said.\r\n\u201CThe king keeps careful track of his ardents. He and Brother Ixil think I\u2019m on cataloging duty today.\u201D\r\nShe found herself smiling. \u201CYou\u2019re scrapping your day\u2019s work to go on a picnic with me?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes.\u201D\r\n\u201CI thought you were\r\nsupposedto spend time with me,\u201D she said, folding her arms. \u201CTo protect my soul.\u201D\r\n\u201CI was. But there are those among the ardents who worry that I\u2019m a little\r\ntoointerested in you.\u201D\r\n\u201CThey\u2019re right.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll come see you tomorrow,\u201D he said, peeking up over the top of the shalebark. \u201CAssuming I\u2019m not stuck in indexing all day as a punishment.\u201D He smiled at her. \u201CIf I decide to leave the ardentia, that is my choice, and they cannot forbid it\u2014though they may try to distract me.\u201D He scrambled away as she prepared herself to tell him that he was presuming too much.\r\nShe couldn\u2019t get the words out. Perhaps because she was growing less and less certain\r\nwhatshe wanted. Shouldn\u2019t she be focused on helping her family?\r\nBy now, Jasnah likely had discovered that her Soulcaster didn\u2019t work, but saw no advantage in revealing it. Shallan should leave. She could go to Jasnah and use the terrible experience in the alleyway as an excuse to quit.\r\nAnd yet, she was terribly reluctant. Kabsal was part of that, but he wasn\u2019t the main reason. The truth was that, despite her occasional complaints, she\r\nlovedlearning to be a scholar. Even after Jasnah\u2019s philosophical training, even after spending days reading book after book. Even with the confusion and the stress, Shallan often felt fulfilled in a way she\u2019d never been before. Yes, Jasnah had been wrong to kill those men, but Shallan wanted to know enough about philosophy to cite the correct reasons why. Yes, digging through historical records could be tedious, but Shallan appreciated the skills and patience she was learning; they were sure to be of value when she got to do her own deep research in the future.\r\nDays spent learning, lunches spent laughing with Kabsal, evenings chatting and debating with Jasnah.\r\nThatwas what she wanted. And those were the parts of her life that were complete lies.\r\nTroubled, she picked up the basket of bread and jam, then made her way back to the Conclave and Jasnah\u2019s suite. An envelope addressed to her sat in the waiting bin. Shallan frowned, breaking the seal to look inside.\r\nLass,it read.\r\nWe got your message. TheWind\u2019s Pleasure\r\nwill soon be at port in Kharbranth again. Of course we\u2019ll give you passage and return to your estates. It would be my pleasure to have you aboard. We are Davar men, we are. Indebted to your family.\r\nWe\u2019re making a quick trip over to the mainland, but will hurry to Kharbranth next. Expect us in one week\u2019s time to pick you up.\r\n\u2014\r\nCaptain Tozbek\r\nThe undertext, written by Tozbek\u2019s wife, read even more clearly.\r\nWe\u2019d happily give you free passage, Brightness, if you\u2019re willing to do some scribing for us during the trip. The ledgers badly need to be rewritten.\r\nShallan stared at the note for a long time. She\u2019d wanted to know where he was and when he was planning to return, but he\u2019d apparently taken her letter as a request to come and pick her up.\r\nIt seemed a fitting deadline. That would put her departure at three weeks after stealing the Soulcaster, as she\u2019d told Nan Balat to expect. If Jasnah hadn\u2019t reacted to the Soulcaster switch by then, Shallan would have to take it to mean that she wasn\u2019t under suspicion.\r\nOne week. She\r\nwouldbe on that ship. It made her break inside to realize it, but it had to be done. She lowered the paper and left the guest hallway, her steps taking her through the twisting corridors into the Veil.\r\nShortly, she stood outside Jasnah\u2019s alcove. The princess sat at her desk, reed scratching at a notebook. She glanced up. \u201CI thought I told you that you could do whatever you want today.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou did,\u201D Shallan said. \u201CAnd I realized that what I want to do is study.\u201D\r\nJasnah smiled in a sly, understanding way. Almost a\r\nself-satisfiedway. If she only knew. \u201CWell, I\u2019m not going to chide you for that,\u201D Jasnah said, turning back to her research.\r\nShallan sat, offering the bread and jam to Jasnah, who shook her head and continued researching. Shallan cut herself another slice and topped it with jam. Then she opened a book and sighed in satisfaction.\r\nIn one week, she\u2019d have to leave. But in the meantime, she would let herself pretend a little while longer."

      "ChapterName": "43: THE WRETCH",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\n\u201CThey lived out in the wilds, always awaiting the Desolation\u2014or sometimes, a foolish child who took no heed of the night\u2019s darkness.\u201D\r\n\u2014A child\u2019s tale, yes, but this quote from\r\nShadows Rememberedseems to hint at the truth I seek. See page 82, the fourth tale.\r\nKaladin awoke to a familiar feeling of dread.\r\nHe\u2019d spent much of the night lying awake on the hard floor, staring up into the dark, thinking. Why try? Why care? There is no hope for these men.\r\nHe felt like a wanderer seeking desperately for a pathway into the city to escape wild beasts. But the city was atop a steep mountain, and no matter how he approached, the climb was always the same. Impossible. A hundred different paths. The same result.\r\nSurviving his punishment would not save his men. Training them to run faster would not save them. They were bait. The efficiency of the bait did not change its purpose or its fate.\r\nKaladin forced himself to his feet. He felt ground down, like a millstone used far too long. He still didn\u2019t understand how he\u2019d survived.\r\nDid you preserve me, Almighty? Save me so that I could watch them die?\r\nYou were supposed to burn prayers to send them to the Almighty, who waited for his Heralds to recapture the Tranquiline Halls. That had never made sense to Kaladin. The Almighty was supposed to be able to see all and know all. So why did he need a prayer burned before he would do anything? Why did he need people to fight for him in the first place?\r\nKaladin left the barrack, stepping into the light. Then he froze.\r\nThe men were lined up, waiting. A ragged bunch of bridgemen, wearing brown leather vests and short trousers that only reached their knees. Dirty shirts, sleeves rolled to the elbows, lacing down the front. Dusty skin, mops of ragged hair. And yet now, because of Rock\u2019s gift, they all had neatly trimmed beards or clean-shaven faces. Everything else about them was worn. But their faces were clean.\r\nKaladin raised a hesitant hand to his face, touching his unkempt black beard. The men seemed to be waiting for something. \u201CWhat?\u201D he asked.\r\nThe men shifted uncomfortably, glancing toward the lumberyard. They were waiting for him to lead them in practice, of course. But practice was futile. He opened his mouth to tell them that, but hesitated as he saw something approaching. Four men, carrying a palanquin. A tall, thin man in a violet lighteyes\u2019s coat walked beside it.\r\nThe men turned to look. \u201CWhat\u2019s this?\u201D Hobber asked, scratching at his thick neck.\r\n\u201CIt will be Lamaril\u2019s replacement,\u201D Kaladin said, gently pushing his way through the line of bridgemen. Syl flitted down and landed on his shoulder as the palanquin bearers stopped before Kaladin and turned to the side, revealing a dark-haired woman wearing a sleek violet dress decorated with golden glyphs. She lounged on her side, resting on a cushioned couch, her eyes a pale blue.\r\n\u201CI am Brightness Hashal,\u201D she said, voice lightly touched by a Kholinar accent. \u201CMy husband, Brightlord Matal, is your new captain.\u201D\r\nKaladin held his tongue, biting back a remark. He had some experience with lighteyes who got \u201Cpromoted\u201D to positions like this one. Matal himself said nothing, simply standing with his hand resting on the hilt of his sword. He was tall\u2014nearly as tall as Kaladin\u2014but spindly. Delicate hands. That sword hadn\u2019t seen much practice.\r\n\u201CWe have been advised,\u201D Hashal said, \u201Cthat this crew has been troublesome.\u201D Her eyes narrowed, focusing on Kaladin. \u201CIt seems that you have survived the Almighty\u2019s judgment. I bear a message for you from your betters. The Almighty has given you another chance to prove yourself as a bridgeman. That is all. Many are trying to read too much into what happened, so Highprince Sadeas has forbidden gawkers to come see you.\r\n\u201CMy husband does not intend to run the bridge crews with his predecessor\u2019s laxness. My husband is a well-respected and honored associate of Highprince Sadeas himself, not some near-darkeyed mongrel like Lamaril.\u201D\r\n\u201CIs that so?\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CThen how did he end up in\r\nthislatrine pit of a job?\u201D\r\nHashal didn\u2019t display a hint of anger at the comment. She flicked her fingers to the side, and one of the soldiers stepped forward and rammed the butt of his spear toward Kaladin\u2019s stomach.\r\nKaladin caught it, old reflexes still too keen. Possibilities flashed through his mind, and he could see the fight before it took place.\r\nYank on the spear, throw the soldier off guard.\r\nStep forward and ram an elbow into his forearm, making him drop the weapon.\r\nTake control, spin the spear up and slam the soldier on the side of the head.\r\nSpin into a sweep to drop the two who came to help their companion.\r\nRaise the spear for the\u2014\r\nNo. That would only get Kaladin killed.\r\nKaladin released the butt of the spear. The soldier blinked in surprise that a mere bridgeman had blocked his blow. Scowling, the soldier jerked the butt up and slammed it into the side of Kaladin\u2019s head.\r\nKaladin let it hit him, rolling with it, allowing it to toss him to the ground. His head rang from the shock, but his eyesight stopped spinning after a moment. He\u2019d have a headache, but probably no concussion.\r\nHe took in a few deep breaths, lying on the ground, hands forming fists. His fingers seemed to burn where he had touched the spear. The soldier stepped back into position beside the palanquin.\r\n\u201CNo laxness,\u201D Hashal said calmly. \u201CIf you must know, my husband\r\nrequestedthis assignment. The bridge crews are essential to Brightlord Sadeas\u2019s advantage in the War of Reckoning. Their mismanagement under Lamaril was disgraceful.\u201D\r\nRock knelt down, helping Kaladin to his feet while scowling at the lighteyes and their soldiers. Kaladin stumbled up, holding his hand to the side of his head. His fingers felt slick and wet, and a trickle of warm blood ran down his neck to his shoulder.\r\n\u201CFrom now on,\u201D Hashal said, \u201Caside from doing normal bridge duty, each crew will be assigned only\r\nonetype of work duty. Gaz!\u201D\r\nThe short bridge sergeant poked out from behind the palanquin. Kaladin hadn\u2019t noticed him there, behind the porters and the soldiers. \u201CYes, Brightness?\u201D Gaz bowed several times.\r\n\u201CMy husband wishes Bridge Four to be assigned chasm duty permanently. Whenever they are not needed for bridge duty, I want them working in those chasms. This will be far more efficient. They will know which sections have been scoured recently, and will not cover the same ground. You see? Efficiency. They will start immediately.\u201D\r\nShe rapped on the side of her palanquin, and the porters turned, bearing her away. Her husband continued to walk alongside her without saying a word, and Gaz hurried to keep up. Kaladin stared after them, holding his hand to his head. Dunny ran and fetched him a bandage.\r\n\u201CChasm duty,\u201D Moash grumbled. \u201CGreat job, lordling. She\u2019d see us dead from a chasmfiend if the Parshendi arrows don\u2019t take us.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat are we going to do?\u201D asked lean, balding Peet, his voice edged with worry.\r\n\u201CWe get to work,\u201D Kaladin said, taking the bandage from Dunny.\r\nHe walked away, leaving them in a frightened clump.\r\nA short time later, Kaladin stood at the edge of the chasm, looking down. The hot light of the noon sun burned the back of his neck and cast his shadow downward into the rift, to join with those below.\r\nI could fly,he thought.\r\nStep off and fall, wind blowing against me. Fly for a few moments. A few, beautiful moments.\r\nHe knelt and grabbed the rope ladder, then climbed down into the darkness. The other bridgemen followed in a silent group. They\u2019d been infected by his mood.\r\nKaladin knew what was happening to him. Step by step, he was turning back into the wretch he had been. He\u2019d always known it was a danger. He\u2019d clung to the bridgemen as a lifeline. But he was letting go now.\r\nAs he stepped down the rungs, a faint translucent figure of blue and white dropped beside him, sitting on a swinglike seat. Its ropes disappeared a few inches above Syl\u2019s head.\r\n\u201CWhat is wrong with you?\u201D she asked softly.\r\nKaladin just kept climbing down.\r\n\u201CYou should be happy. You survived the storms. The other bridgemen were so excited.\u201D\r\n\u201CI itched to fight that soldier,\u201D Kaladin whispered.\r\nSyl cocked her head.\r\n\u201CI could have beaten him,\u201D Kaladin continued. \u201CI probably could have beaten all four of them. I\u2019ve always been good with the spear. No, not good. Durk called me amazing. A natural born soldier, an artist with the spear.\u201D\r\n\u201CMaybe you should have fought them, then.\u201D\r\n\u201CI thought you didn\u2019t like killing.\u201D\r\n\u201CI hate it,\u201D she said, growing more translucent. \u201CBut I\u2019ve helped men kill before.\u201D\r\nKaladin froze on the ladder. \u201C\r\nWhat?\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s true,\u201D she said. \u201CI can remember it, just faintly.\u201D\r\n\u201CHow?\u201D\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know.\u201D She grew paler. \u201CI don\u2019t want to talk about it. But it was right to do. I feel it.\u201D\r\nKaladin hung for a moment longer. Teft called down, asking if something was wrong. He started to descend again.\r\n\u201CI didn\u2019t fight the soldiers today,\u201D Kaladin said, eyes toward the chasm wall, \u201Cbecause it wouldn\u2019t work. My father told me that it is impossible to protect by killing. Well, he was wrong.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CHe was wrong,\u201D Kaladin said, \u201Cbecause he implied that you could protect people in\r\notherways. You can\u2019t. This world wants them dead, and trying to save them is pointless.\u201D He reached the bottom of the chasm, stepping into darkness. Teft reached the bottom next and lit his torch, bathing the moss-covered stone walls in flickering orange light.\r\n\u201CIs that why you didn\u2019t accept it?\u201D Syl whispered, flitting over and landing on Kaladin\u2019s shoulder. \u201CThe glory. All those months ago?\u201D\r\nKaladin shook his head. \u201CNo. That was something else.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat did you say, Kaladin?\u201D Teft raised the torch. The aging bridgeman\u2019s face looked older than usual in the flickering light, the shadows it created emphasizing the furrows in his skin.\r\n\u201CNothing, Teft,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CNothing important.\u201D\r\nSyl sniffed at that. Kaladin ignored her, lighting his torch from Teft\u2019s as the other bridgemen arrived. When they were all down, Kaladin led the way out into the dark rift. The pale sky seemed distant here, like a far-off scream. This place was a tomb, with rotting wood and stagnant pools of water, good only for growing cremling larvae.\r\nThe bridgemen clustered together unconsciously as they always did in this fell place. Kaladin walked in front, and Syl fell silent. He gave Teft the chalk to mark directions, and didn\u2019t pause to pick up salvage. But neither did he walk too quickly. The other bridgemen were hushed behind them, speaking in occasional whispers too low to echo. As if their words were strangled by the gloom.\r\nRock eventually moved up to walk beside Kaladin. \u201CIs difficult job, we have been given. But we are bridgemen! Life, it is difficult, eh? Is nothing new. We must have plan. How do we fight next?\u201D\r\n\u201CThere is no next fight, Rock.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut we have won grand victory! Look, not days ago, you were delirious. You should have died. I know this thing. But instead, you walk, strong as any other man. Ha! Stronger. Is miracle. The\r\nUli\u2019tekanakiguide you.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s not a miracle, Rock,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CIt\u2019s more of a curse.\u201D\r\n\u201CHow is that a curse, my friend?\u201D Rock asked, chuckling. He jumped up and into a puddle and laughed louder as it splashed Teft, who was walking just behind. The large Horneater could be remarkably childlike at times. \u201CLiving, this thing is no curse!\u201D\r\n\u201CIt is if it brings me back to watch you all die,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CBetter I shouldn\u2019t have survived that storm. I\u2019m just going to end up dead from a Parshendi arrow. We all are.\u201D\r\nRock looked troubled. When Kaladin offered nothing more, he withdrew. They continued, uncomfortably passing sections of scarred wall where chasmfiends had left their marks. Eventually they stumbled across a heap of bodies deposited by the highstorms. Kaladin stopped, holding up his torch, the other bridgemen peeking around him. Some fifty people had been washed into a recess in the rock, a small dead-end side passage in the stone.\r\nThe bodies were piled there, a wall of the dead, arms hanging out, reeds and flotsam stuck between them. Kaladin saw at a glance that the corpses were old enough to begin bloating and rotting. Behind him, one of the men retched, which caused a few of the others to do so as well. The scent was terrible, the corpses slashed and ripped into by cremlings and larger carrion beasts, many of which scuttled away from the light. A disembodied hand lay nearby, and a trail of blood led away. There were also fresh scrapes in the lichen as high as fifteen feet up the wall. A chasmfiend had ripped one of the bodies loose to devour. It might come back for the others.\r\nKaladin didn\u2019t retch. He shoved his half-burned torch between two large stones, then got to work, pulling bodies from the pile. At least they weren\u2019t rotted enough to come apart. The bridgemen slowly filled in around him, working. Kaladin let his mind grow numb, not thinking.\r\nOnce the bodies were down, the bridgemen laid them in a line. Then they began pulling off their armor, searching their pockets, taking knives from belts. Kaladin left gathering the spears to the others, working by himself off to the side.\r\nTeft knelt beside Kaladin, rolling over a body with a head smashed by the fall. The shorter man began to undo the straps on the fallen man\u2019s breastplate. \u201CDo you want to talk?\u201D\r\nKaladin didn\u2019t say anything. He just kept working.\r\nDon\u2019t think about the future. Don\u2019t think about what will happen. Just survive.\r\nDon\u2019t care, but don\u2019t despair. Just be.\r\n\u201CKaladin.\u201D Teft\u2019s voice was like a knife, digging into Kaladin\u2019s shell, making him squirm.\r\n\u201CIf I wanted to talk,\u201D Kaladin grumbled, \u201Cwould I be working here by myself?\u201D\r\n\u201CFair enough,\u201D Teft said. He finally got the breastplate strap undone. \u201CThe other men are confused, son. They want to know what we\u2019re going to do next.\u201D\r\nKaladin sighed, then stood, turning to look at the bridgemen. \u201CI don\u2019t know what to do! If we try to protect ourselves, Sadeas will have us punished! We\u2019re bait, and we\u2019re going to die. There\u2019s nothing I can do about it! It\u2019s hopeless.\u201D\r\nThe bridgemen regarded him with shock.\r\nKaladin turned from them and went back to work, kneeling beside Teft. \u201CThere,\u201D he said. \u201CI explained it to them.\u201D\r\n\u201CIdiot,\u201D Teft said under his breath. \u201CAfter all you\u2019ve done, you\u2019re abandoning us now?\u201D\r\nTo the side, the bridgemen turned back to work. Kaladin caught a few of them grumbling. \u201CBastard,\u201D Moash said. \u201CI said this would happen.\u201D\r\n\u201CAbandoning you?\u201D Kaladin hissed to Teft.\r\nJust let me be. Let me go back to apathy. At least then there\u2019s no pain.\u201CTeft, I\u2019ve spent hours and hours trying to find a way out, but there isn\u2019t one! Sadeas\r\nwantsus dead. Lighteyes get what they want; that\u2019s the way the world works.\u201D\r\n\u201CSo?\u201D\r\nKaladin ignored him, turning back to his work, pulling at the boot on a soldier whose fibula looked to have been shattered in three different places. That made it storming awkward to get the boot off.\r\n\u201CWell, maybe we will die,\u201D Teft said. \u201CBut maybe this isn\u2019t about surviving.\u201D\r\nWhy was\r\nTeft\u2014of all people\u2014trying to cheer him up? \u201CIf survival isn\u2019t the point, Teft, then what is?\u201D Kaladin finally got the boot off. He turned to the next body in line, then froze.\r\nIt was a bridgeman. Kaladin didn\u2019t recognize him, but that vest and those sandals were unmistakable. He lay slumped against the wall, arms at his sides, mouth slightly open and eyelids sunken. The skin on one of the hands had slipped free and pulled away.\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know what the point is,\u201D Teft grumbled. \u201CBut it seems pathetic to give up. We should keep fighting. Right until those arrows take us. You know, \u2018journey before destination.\u2019\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat does\r\nthatmean?\u201D\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know,\u201D Teft said, looking down quickly. \u201CJust something I heard once.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s something the Lost Radiants used to say,\u201D Sigzil said, walking past.\r\nKaladin glanced to the side. The soft-spoken Azish man set a shield on a pile. He looked up, brown skin dark in the torchlight. \u201CIt was their motto. Part of it, at least. \u2018Life before death. Strength before weakness. Journey before destination.\u2019\u201D\r\n\u201CLost Radiants?\u201D Skar said, carrying an armful of boots. \u201CWho\u2019s bringing\r\nthemup?\u201D\r\n\u201CTeft did,\u201D Moash said.\r\n\u201CI did not! That was just something I heard once.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat does it even mean?\u201D Dunny asked.\r\n\u201CI said I don\u2019t know!\u201D Teft said.\r\n\u201CIt was supposedly one of their creeds,\u201D Sigzil said. \u201CIn Yulay, there are groups of people who talk of the Radiants. And wish for their return.\u201D\r\n\u201CWho\u2019d want them to return?\u201D Skar said, leaning back against the wall, folding his arms. \u201CThey betrayed us to the Voidbringers.\u201D\r\n\u201CHa!\u201D Rock said. \u201CVoidbringers! Lowlander nonsense. Is campfire tale told by children.\u201D\r\n\u201CThey were real,\u201D Skar said defensively. \u201CEveryone knows that.\u201D\r\n\u201CEveryone who listens to campfire stories!\u201D Rock said with a laugh. \u201CToo much air! Makes your minds soft. Is all right, though\u2014you are still my family. Just the dumb ones!\u201D\r\nTeft scowled as the others continued to talk about the Lost Radiants.\r\n\u201CJourney before destination,\u201D Syl whispered on Kaladin\u2019s shoulder. \u201CI like that.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhy?\u201D Kaladin asked, kneeling down to untie the dead bridgeman\u2019s sandals.\r\n\u201CBecause,\u201D she replied, as if that were explanation enough. \u201CTeft is right, Kaladin. I know you want to give up. But you can\u2019t.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhy not?\u201D\r\n\u201CBecause you\r\ncan\u2019t.\u201D\r\n\u201CWe\u2019re assigned to chasm duty from now on,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CWe won\u2019t be able to collect any more reeds to make money. That means no more bandages, antiseptic, or food for the nightly meals. With all of these bodies, we\u2019re bound to run into rotspren, and the men will grow sick\u2014assuming chasmfiends don\u2019t eat us or a surprise highstorm doesn\u2019t drown us. And we\u2019ll have to keep running those bridges until Damnation ends, losing man after man. It\u2019s hopeless.\u201D\r\nThe men were still talking. \u201CThe Lost Radiants helped the other side,\u201D Skar argued. \u201CThey were tarnished all along.\u201D\r\nTeft took offense at that. The wiry man stood up straight, pointing at Skar. \u201CYou don\u2019t know anything! It was too long ago. Nobody knows what really happened.\u201D\r\n\u201CThen why do all the stories say the same thing?\u201D Skar demanded. \u201CThey abandoned us. Just like the lighteyes are abandoning us right now. Maybe Kaladin\u2019s right. Maybe there\r\nisno hope.\u201D\r\nKaladin looked down. Those words haunted him.\r\nMaybe Kaladin is right\u2026maybe there is no hope\u2026.\r\nHe\u2019d done this before. Under his last owner, before being sold to Tvlakv and being made a bridgeman. He\u2019d given up on a quiet night after leading Goshel and the other slaves in rebellion. They\u2019d been slaughtered. But somehow he\u2019d survived. Storm it all, why did\r\nhealways survive?\r\nI can\u2019t do it again,he thought, squeezing his eyes shut.\r\nI can\u2019t help them.\r\nTien. Tukks. Goshel. Dallet. The nameless slave he\u2019d tried to heal in Tvlakv\u2019s slave wagons. All had ended up the same. Kaladin had the touch of failure. Sometimes he gave them hope, but what was hope except another opportunity for failure? How many times could a man fall before he no longer stood back up?\r\n\u201CI just think we\u2019re ignorant,\u201D Teft grumbled. \u201CI don\u2019t like listening to what the lighteyes say about the past. Their women write all the histories, you know.\u201D\r\n\u201CI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re arguing about this, Teft,\u201D Skar said, exasperated. \u201CWhat next? Should we let the Voidbringers steal our hearts? Maybe they\u2019re just misunderstood. Or the Parshendi. Maybe we should just\r\nletthem kill our king whenever they want.\u201D\r\n\u201CWould you two just storm off?\u201D Moash snapped. \u201CIt doesn\u2019t matter. You heard Kaladin. Even\r\nhethinks we\u2019re as good as dead.\u201D\r\nKaladin couldn\u2019t take their voices anymore. He stumbled away, into the darkness, away from the torchlight. None of the men followed him. He entered a place of dark shadows, with only the distant ribbon of sky above for light.\r\nHere, Kaladin escaped their eyes. In the darkness he ran into a boulder, stumbling to a stop. It was slick with moss and lichen. He stood with his hands pressed against it, then groaned and turned around to lean back against it. Syl alighted in front of him, still visible, despite the darkness. She sat down in the air, arranging her dress around her legs.\r\n\u201CI can\u2019t save them, Syl,\u201D Kaladin whispered, anguished.\r\n\u201CAre you certain?\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve failed every time before.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd so you\u2019ll fail this time too?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes.\u201D\r\nShe fell silent. \u201CWell then,\u201D she eventually said. \u201CLet\u2019s say that you\u2019re right.\u201D\r\n\u201CSo why fight? I told myself that I would try one last time. But I failed before I began. There\u2019s no saving them.\u201D\r\n\u201CDoesn\u2019t the fight itself mean anything?\u201D\r\n\u201CNot if you\u2019re destined to die.\u201D He hung his head.\r\nSigzil\u2019s words echoed in his head.\r\nLife before death. Strength before weakness. Journey before destination.Kaladin looked up at the crack of sky. Like a faraway river of pure, blue water.\r\nLife before death.\r\nWhat did the saying mean? That men should seek life before seeking death? That was obvious. Or did it mean something else? That life came before death? Again, obvious. And yet the simple words spoke to him. Death comes, they whispered. Death comes to all. But life comes first. Cherish it.\r\nDeath is the destination. But the journey, that is life. That is what matters.\r\nA cold wind blew through the corridor of stone, washing over him, bringing crisp, fresh scents and blowing away the stink of rotting corpses.\r\nNobody cared for the bridgemen. Nobody cared for those at the bottom, with the darkest eyes. And yet, that wind seemed to whisper to him over and over.\r\nLife before death. Life before death. Live before you die.\r\nHis foot hit something. He bent down and picked it up. A small rock. He could barely make it out in the darkness. He recognized what was happening to him, this melancholy, this sense of despair. It had taken him often when he\u2019d been younger, most frequently during the weeks of the Weeping, when the sky was hidden by clouds. During those times, Tien had cheered him up, helped him pull out of his despair. Tien had always been able to do that.\r\nOnce he\u2019d lost his brother, he\u2019d dealt with these periods of sadness more awkwardly. He\u2019d become the wretch, not caring\u2014but also not despairing. It had seemed better not to feel at all, as opposed to feeling pain.\r\nI\u2019m going to fail them,Kaladin thought, squeezing his eyes shut.\r\nWhy try?\r\nWasn\u2019t he a fool to keep grasping as he did? If only he could win once. That would be enough. As long as he could believe that he could help someone, as long as he believed that some paths led to places other than darkness, he could hope.\r\nYou promised yourself you would try one last time,he thought.\r\nThey aren\u2019t dead yet.\r\nStill alive. For now.\r\nThere was one thing he hadn\u2019t tried. Something he\u2019d been too frightened of. Every time he\u2019d tried it in the past, he\u2019d lost everything.\r\nThe wretch seemed to be standing before him. He meant release. Apathy. Did Kaladin really want to go back to that? It was a false refuge. Being that man hadn\u2019t protected him. It had only led him deeper and deeper until taking his own life had seemed the better way.\r\nLife before death.\r\nKaladin stood up, opening his eyes, dropping the small rock. He walked slowly back toward the torchlight. The bridgemen looked up from their work. So many questioning eyes. Some doubtful, some grim, others encouraging. Rock, Dunny, Hobber, Leyten. They believed in him. He had survived the storms. One miracle granted.\r\n\u201CThere is something we could try,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CBut it will most likely end with us all dead at the hands of our own army.\u201D\r\n\u201CWe\u2019re bound to end up dead anyway,\u201D Maps noted. \u201CYou said so yourself.\u201D Several of the others nodded.\r\nKaladin took a deep breath. \u201CWe have to try to escape.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut the warcamp is guarded!\u201D said Earless Jaks. \u201CBridgemen aren\u2019t allowed out without supervision. They know we\u2019d run.\u201D\r\n\u201CWe\u2019d die,\u201D Moash said, face grim. \u201CWe\u2019re miles and miles from civilization. There\u2019s nothing out here but greatshells, and no shelter from highstorms.\u201D\r\n\u201CI know,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CBut it\u2019s either this or the Parshendi arrows.\u201D\r\nThe men fell silent.\r\n\u201CThey\u2019re going to send us down here every day to rob corpses,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CAnd they don\u2019t send us with supervision, since they fear the chasmfiends. Most bridgeman work is busywork, to distract us from our fate, so we only have to bring back a small amount of salvage.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou think we should choose one of these chasms and flee down it?\u201D Skar asked. \u201CThey\u2019ve tried to map them all. The crews never reached the other side of the Plains\u2014they got killed by chasmfiends or highstorm floods.\u201D\r\nKaladin shook his head. \u201CThat\u2019s not what we\u2019re going to do.\u201D He kicked at something on the ground before him\u2014a fallen spear. His kick sent it into the air toward Moash, who caught it, surprised.\r\n\u201CI can train you to use those,\u201D Kaladin said softly.\r\nThe men fell silent, looking at the weapon.\r\n\u201CWhat good would this thing do?\u201D Rock asked, taking the spear from Moash, looking it over. \u201CWe cannot fight an army.\u201D\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CBut if I train you, then we can attack a guard post at night. We might be able to get away.\u201D Kaladin looked at them, meeting each man\u2019s eyes in turn. \u201COnce we\u2019re free, they\u2019ll send soldiers after us. Sadeas won\u2019t let bridgemen kill his soldiers and get away with it. We\u2019ll have to hope he underestimates us and sends a small group at first. If we kill them, we might be able to get far enough away to hide. It will be dangerous. Sadeas will go to great lengths to recapture us, and we\u2019ll likely end with an entire company chasing us down. Storm it, we\u2019ll probably never escape the camp in the first place. But it\u2019s something.\u201D\r\nHe fell silent, waiting as the men exchanged uncertain glances.\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll do it,\u201D Teft said, straightening up.\r\n\u201CMe too,\u201D Moash said, stepping forward. He seemed eager.\r\n\u201CAnd I,\u201D Sigzil said. \u201CI would rather spit in their Alethi faces and die on their swords than remain a slave.\u201D\r\n\u201CHa!\u201D Rock said. \u201CAnd I shall cook you all much food to keep you full while you kill.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou won\u2019t fight with us?\u201D Dunny asked, surprised.\r\n\u201CIs beneath me,\u201D Rock said raising his chin.\r\n\u201CWell, I\u2019ll do it,\u201D Dunny said. \u201CI\u2019m your man, Captain.\u201D\r\nOthers began to chime in, each man standing, several grabbing spears from the wet ground. They didn\u2019t yell in excitement or roar like other troops Kaladin had led. They were frightened by the idea of fighting\u2014most had been common slaves or lowly workmen. But they were willing.\r\nKaladin stepped forward and began to outline a plan."

      "ChapterName": "44: THE WEEPING",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\nFIVE YEARS AGO\r\nKaladin hated the Weeping. It marked the end of an old year and the coming of a new one, four solid weeks of rain in a ceaseless cascade of sullen drops. Never furious, never passionate like a highstorm. Slow, steady. Like the blood of a dying year that was taking its last few shambling steps toward the cairn. While other seasons of weather came and went unpredictably, the Weeping never failed to return at the same time each year. Unfortunately.\r\nKaladin lay on the sloped roof of his house in Hearthstone. A small pail of pitch sat next to him, covered by a piece of wood. It was almost empty now that he\u2019d finished patching the roof. The Weeping was a miserable time to do this work, but it was also when a persistent leak could be most irritating. They\u2019d repatch when the Weeping ended, but at least this way they wouldn\u2019t have to suffer a steady stream of drips onto their dining table for the next weeks.\r\nHe lay on his back, staring up at the sky. Perhaps he should have climbed down and gone inside, but he was already soaked through. So he stayed. Watching, thinking.\r\nAnother army was passing through the town. One of many these days\u2014they often came during the Weeping, resupplying and moving to new battlefields. Roshone had made a rare appearance to welcome the warlord: Highmarshal Amaram himself, apparently a distant cousin as well as head of Alethi defense in this area. He was of the most renowned soldiers still in Alethkar; most had left for the Shattered Plains.\r\nThe small raindrops misted Kaladin. Many of the others liked these weeks\u2014there were no highstorms, save for one right in the middle. To the townspeople, it was a cherished time to rest from farming and relax. But Kaladin longed for the sun and the wind. He actually missed the highstorms, with their rage and vitality. These days were dreary, and he found it difficult to get anything productive done. As if the lack of storms left him without strength.\r\nFew people had seen much of Roshone since the ill-fated whitespine hunt and the death of his son. He hid in his mansion, increasingly reclusive. The people of Hearthstone trod very lightly, as if they expected that any moment he could explode and turn his rage against them. Kaladin wasn\u2019t worried about that. A storm\u2014whether from a person or the sky\u2014was something you could react to. But this suffocation, this slow and steady dousing of life\u2026That was far, far worse.\r\n\u201CKaladin?\u201D Tien\u2019s voice called. \u201CAre you still up there?\u201D\r\n\u201CYeah,\u201D he called back, not moving. The clouds were so\r\nblandduring the Weeping. Could anything be more lifeless than that miserable grey?\r\nTien rounded to the back of the building, where the roof sloped down to touch the ground. He had his hands in the pockets of his long raincoat, a wide-brimmed hat on his head. Both looked too large for him, but clothing always seemed too large for Tien. Even when it fit him properly.\r\nKaladin\u2019s brother climbed up onto the roof and walked up beside him, then lay down, staring upward. Someone else might have tried to cheer Kaladin up, and they would have failed. But somehow Tien knew the right thing to do. For the moment, that was keeping silent.\r\n\u201CYou like the rain, don\u2019t you?\u201D Kaladin finally asked him.\r\n\u201CYeah,\u201D Tien said. Of course, Tien liked pretty much everything. \u201CHard to stare up at like this, though. I keep blinking.\u201D\r\nFor some reason, that made Kaladin smile.\r\n\u201CI made you something,\u201D Tien said. \u201CAt the shop today.\u201D\r\nKaladin\u2019s parents were worried; Ral the carpenter had taken Tien, though he didn\u2019t really need another apprentice, and was reportedly dissatisfied with the boy\u2019s work. Tien got distracted easily, Ral complained.\r\nKaladin sat up as Tien fished something out of his pocket. It was a small wooden horse, intricately carved.\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t worry about the water,\u201D Tien said, handing it over. \u201CI sealed it already.\u201D\r\n\u201CTien,\u201D Kaladin said, amazed. \u201CThis is\r\nbeautiful.\u201D The details were amazing\u2014the eyes, the hooves, the lines in the tail. It looked just like the majestic animals that pulled Roshone\u2019s carriage. \u201CDid you show this to Ral?\u201D\r\n\u201CHe said it was good,\u201D Tien said, smiling beneath his oversized hat. \u201CBut he told me I should have been making a chair instead. I kind of got into trouble.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut how\u2026I mean, Tien, he\u2019s got to see this is amazing!\u201D\r\n\u201COh, I don\u2019t know about that,\u201D Tien said, still smiling. \u201CIt\u2019s just a horse. Master Ral likes things you can use. Things to sit on, things to put clothes in. But I think I can make a good chair tomorrow, something that will make him proud.\u201D\r\nKaladin looked at his brother, with his innocent face and affable nature. He hadn\u2019t lost either, though he was now into his teenage years.\r\nHow is it you can always smile?Kaladin thought.\r\nIt\u2019s dreadful outside, your master treats you like crem, and your family is slowly being strangled by the citylord. And yet you smile. How, Tien?\r\nAnd why is it that you make me want to smile too?\r\n\u201CFather spent another of the spheres, Tien,\u201D Kaladin found himself saying. Each time their father was forced to do that, he seemed to grow a little more wan, stand a little less tall. Those spheres were dun these days, no light in them. You couldn\u2019t infuse spheres during the Weeping. They all ran out, eventually.\r\n\u201CThere are plenty more,\u201D Tien said.\r\n\u201CRoshone is trying to wear us down,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CBit by bit, smother us.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s not as bad as it seems, Kaladin,\u201D his brother said, reaching up to hold his arm. \u201CThings are never as bad as they seem. You\u2019ll see.\u201D\r\nSo many objections rose in his mind, but Tien\u2019s smile banished them. There, in the midst of the dreariest part of the year, Kaladin felt for a moment as if he had glimpsed sunshine. He could swear he felt things grow brighter around them, the storm retreating a shade, the sky lightening.\r\nTheir mother rounded the back of the building. She looked up at them, as if amused to find them both sitting on the roof in the rain. She stepped onto the lower portion. A small group of haspers clung to the stone there; the small two-shelled creatures proliferated during the Weeping. They seemed to grow out of nowhere, much like their cousins the tiny snails, scattered all across the stone.\r\n\u201CWhat are you two talking about?\u201D she asked, walking up and sitting down with them. Hesina rarely acted like the other mothers in town. Sometimes, that bothered Kaladin. Shouldn\u2019t she have sent them into the house or something, complaining that they\u2019d catch a cold? No, she just sat down with them, wearing a brown leather raincoat.\r\n\u201CKaladin\u2019s worried about Father spending the spheres,\u201D Tien said.\r\n\u201COh, I wouldn\u2019t worry about that,\u201D she replied. \u201CWe\u2019ll get you to Kharbranth. You\u2019ll be old enough to leave in two more months.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou two should come with me,\u201D Kal said. \u201CAnd Father too.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd leave the town?\u201D Tien said, as if he\u2019d never considered that possibility. \u201CBut I like it here.\u201D\r\nHesina smiled.\r\n\u201CWhat?\u201D Kaladin said.\r\n\u201CMost young men your age are trying everything they can to be\r\nridof their parents.\u201D\r\n\u201CI can\u2019t go off and leave you here. We\u2019re a family.\u201D\r\n\u201CHe\u2019s trying to strangle us,\u201D Kaladin said, glancing at Tien. Talking with his brother had made him feel a lot better, but his objections were still there. \u201CNobody pays for healing, and I know nobody will pay you for work anymore. What kind of value does Father get for those spheres he spends anyway? Vegetables at ten times the regular price, moldy grain at double?\u201D\r\nHesina smiled. \u201CObservant.\u201D\r\n\u201CFather taught me to notice details. The eyes of a surgeon.\u201D\r\n\u201CWell,\u201D she said, eyes twinkling, \u201Cdid your surgeon\u2019s eyes notice the first time we spent one of the spheres?\u201D\r\n\u201CSure,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CIt was the day after the hunting accident. Father had to buy new cloth to make bandages.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd did we\r\nneednew bandages?\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, no. But you know how Father is. He doesn\u2019t like it when we start to run even a little low.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd so he spent one of those spheres,\u201D Hesina said. \u201CThat he\u2019d hoarded for months and months, butting heads with the citylord over them.\u201D\r\nNot to mention going to such lengths to steal them in the first place,Kaladin thought.\r\nBut you know all about that.He glanced at Tien, who was watching the sky again. So far as Kal knew, his brother hadn\u2019t discovered the truth yet.\r\n\u201CSo your father resisted so long,\u201D Hesina said, \u201Conly to finally break and spend a sphere on some cloth bandages we wouldn\u2019t need for months.\u201D\r\nShe had a point. Why\r\nhadhis father suddenly decided to\u2026\u201CHe\u2019s letting Roshone think he\u2019s winning,\u201D Kaladin said with surprise, looking back at her.\r\nHesina smiled slyly. \u201CRoshone would have found a way to get retribution eventually. It wouldn\u2019t have been easy. Your father ranks high as a citizen, and has the right of inquest. He\r\ndidsave Roshone\u2019s life, and many could testify to the severity of Rillir\u2019s wounds. But Roshone would have found a way. Unless he felt he\u2019d broken us.\u201D\r\nKaladin turned toward the mansion. Though it was hidden by the shroud of rain, he could just make out the tents of the army camped on the field below. What would it be like to live as a soldier, often exposed to storms and rain, to winds and tempests? Once Kaladin would have been intrigued, but the life of a spearman had no call for him now. His mind was filled with diagrams of muscles and memorized lists of symptoms and diseases.\r\n\u201CWe\u2019ll keep spending the spheres,\u201D Hesina said. \u201COne every few weeks. Partially to live, though my family has offered supplies. More to keep Roshone thinking that we\u2019re bending. And then, we send you away. Unexpectedly. You\u2019ll be gone, the spheres safely in the hands of the ardents to use as a stipend during your years of study.\u201D\r\nKaladin blinked in realization. They weren\u2019t losing. They were\r\nwinning.\r\n\u201CThink of it, Kaladin,\u201D Tien said. \u201CYou\u2019ll live in one of the grandest cities in the world! It will be so exciting. You\u2019ll be a man of learning, like Father. You\u2019ll have clerks to read to you from any book you want.\u201D\r\nKaladin pushed wet hair off his forehead. Tien made it sound a lot grander than he\u2019d been thinking. Of course, Tien could make a crem-filled puddle sound grand.\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s true,\u201D his mother said, still staring upward. \u201CYou could learn mathematics, history, politics, tactics, the sciences\u2026\u201D\r\n\u201CAren\u2019t those things women learn?\u201D Kaladin said, frowning.\r\n\u201CLighteyed women study them. But there are male scholars as well. If not as many.\u201D\r\n\u201CAll this to become a surgeon.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou wouldn\u2019t have to become a surgeon. Your life is your own, son. If you take the path of a surgeon, we will be proud. But don\u2019t feel that you need to live your father\u2019s life for him.\u201D She looked down at Kaladin, blinking rainwater from her eyes.\r\n\u201CWhat else would I do?\u201D Kaladin said, stupefied.\r\n\u201CThere are many professions open to men with a good mind and training. If you really wished to study all the arts, you could become an ardent. Or perhaps a stormwarden.\u201D\r\nStormwarden. He reached by reflex for the prayer sewn to his left sleeve, waiting for the day he\u2019d need to burn it for aid. \u201CThey seek to predict the future.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s not the same thing. You\u2019ll see. There are so many things to explore, so many places your mind could go. The world is changing. My family\u2019s most recent letter describes amazing fabrials, like pens that can write across great distances. It might not be long before men are taught to read.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019d never want to learn something like that,\u201D Kaladin said, aghast, glancing at Tien. Was their own\r\nmotherreally saying these things? But then, she\u2019d always been like this. Free, both with her mind and her tongue.\r\nYet, to become a stormwarden\u2026They studied the highstorms, predicted them\u2014yes\u2014but learned about them and their mysteries. They studied the winds themselves.\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CI want to be a surgeon. Like my father.\u201D\r\nHesina smiled. \u201CIf that\u2019s what you choose, then\u2014as I said\u2014we will be proud of you. But father and I just want you to know that you\r\ncanchoose.\u201D\r\nThey sat like that for some time, letting rainwater soak them. Kaladin kept searching those grey clouds, wondering what it was that Tien found so interesting in them. Eventually, he heard splashing below, and Lirin\u2019s face appeared at the side of the house.\r\n\u201CWhat in the\u2026\u201D he said. \u201CAll\r\nthreeof you? What are you doing up here?\u201D\r\n\u201CFeasting,\u201D Kaladin\u2019s mother said nonchalantly.\r\n\u201COn what?\u201D\r\n\u201COn irregularity, dear,\u201D she said.\r\nLirin sighed. \u201CDear, you can be very odd, you know.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd didn\u2019t I just say that?\u201D\r\n\u201CPoint. Well, come on. There\u2019s a gathering in the square.\u201D\r\nHesina frowned. She rose and walked down the slope of the roof. Kaladin glanced at Tien, and the two of them stood. Kaladin stuffed the wooden horse in his pocket and picked his way down, careful on the slick rock, his shoes squishing. Cool water ran down Kaladin\u2019s cheeks as he stepped off onto the ground.\r\nThey followed Lirin toward the square. Kaladin\u2019s father looked worried, and he walked with the beaten-down slouch he was prone to lately. Maybe it was an affectation to fool Roshone, but Kaladin suspected there was some truth to it. His father didn\u2019t like having to give up those spheres, even if it was part of a ruse. It was too much like giving in.\r\nAhead, a crowd was gathering at the town square, everyone holding umbrellas or wearing cloaks.\r\n\u201CWhat is it, Lirin?\u201D Hesina asked, sounding anxious.\r\n\u201CRoshone is going to put in an appearance,\u201D Lirin said. \u201CHe asked Waber to gather everyone. Full town meeting.\u201D\r\n\u201CIn the\r\nrain?\u201D Kaladin asked. \u201CCouldn\u2019t he have waited for Lightday?\u201D\r\nLirin didn\u2019t reply. The family walked in silence, even Tien growing solemn. They passed some rainspren standing in puddles, glowing with a faint blue light, shaped like ankle-high melting candles with no flame. They rarely appeared except during the Weeping. They were said to be the souls of raindrops, glowing blue rods, seeming to melt but never growing smaller, a single blue eye at their tops.\r\nThe townspeople were mostly assembled, gossiping in the rain, by the time Kaladin\u2019s family arrived. Jost and Naget were there, though neither waved to Kaladin; it had been years since they\u2019d been anything resembling friends. Kaladin shivered. His parents called this town home, and his father refused to leave, but it felt less and less like \u201Chome\u201D by the day.\r\nI\u2019ll be leaving it soon,he thought, eager to walk out of Hearthstone and leave these small-minded people behind. To go to a place where lighteyes were men and women of honor and beauty, worthy of the high station given them by the Almighty.\r\nRoshone\u2019s carriage approached. It had lost much of its luster during his years in Hearthstone, the golden paint flaking off, the dark wood chipped by road gravel. As the carriage pulled into the square, Waber and his boys finally got a small canopy erected. The rain had strengthened, and drops hit the cloth with a hollow drumming sound.\r\nThe air smelled different with all of these people around. Up on the roof, it had been fresh and clean. Now it seemed muggy and humid. The carriage door opened. Roshone had gained more weight, and his lighteyes\u2019s suit had been retailored to fit his increased girth. He wore a wooden peg on his right stump, hidden by the cuff of his trouser, and his gait was stiff as he climbed out of the carriage and ducked beneath the canopy, grumbling.\r\nHe hardly seemed the same person, with that beard and wet, stringy hair. But his eyes, they were the same. More beady now because of the fuller cheeks, but still seething as he studied the crowd. As if he had been hit with a rock when he wasn\u2019t looking, and now searched for the culprit.\r\nWas Laral inside the carriage? Someone else moved inside, climbing out, but it turned out to be a lean man with a clean-shaven face and light tan eyes. The dignified man wore a neatly pressed, green formal military uniform and had a sword at his hip. Highmarshal Amaram? He certainly looked impressive, with that strong figure and square face. The difference between him and Roshone was striking.\r\nFinally, Laral did appear, wearing a light yellow dress of an antique fashion, with a flaring skirt and thick bodice. She glanced up at the rain, then waited for a footman to hurry over with an umbrella. Kaladin felt his heart thumping. They hadn\u2019t spoken since the day she\u2019d humiliated him in Roshone\u2019s mansion. And yet, she was\r\ngorgeous. As she had grown through her adolescence, she had gotten prettier and prettier. Some might find that dark hair sprinkled with foreigner blond to be unappealing for its indication of mixed blood, but to Kaladin it was alluring.\r\nBeside Kaladin, his father stiffened, cursing softly.\r\n\u201CWhat?\u201D Tien asked from beside Kaladin, craning to see.\r\n\u201CLaral,\u201D Kaladin\u2019s mother said. \u201CShe\u2019s wearing a bride\u2019s prayer on her sleeve.\u201D\r\nKaladin started, seeing the white cloth with its blue glyphpair sewn onto the sleeve of her dress. She\u2019d burn it when the engagement was formally announced.\r\nBut\u2026who? Rillir was dead!\r\n\u201CI\u2019d heard rumors of this,\u201D Kaladin\u2019s father said. \u201CIt appears Roshone wasn\u2019t willing to part with the connections she offers.\u201D\r\n\u201CHim?\u201D Kaladin asked, stunned. Roshone\r\nhimselfwas marrying her? Others in the crowd had begun speaking as they noticed the prayer.\r\n\u201CLighteyes marry much younger women all the time,\u201D Kaladin\u2019s mother said. \u201CFor them, marriages are often about securing house loyalty.\u201D\r\n\u201C\r\nHim?\u201D Kaladin asked again, incredulous, stepping forward. \u201CWe have to stop it. We have to\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CKaladin,\u201D his father said sharply.\r\n\u201CBut\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CIt is their affair, not ours.\u201D\r\nKaladin fell silent, feeling the larger raindrops hit his head, the smaller ones blowing by as mist. The water ran through the square and pooled in depressions. Near Kaladin, a rainspren sprang up, forming as if out of the water. It stared upward, unblinking.\r\nRoshone leaned on his cane and nodded to Natir, his steward. The man was accompanied by his wife, a stern-looking woman named Alaxia. Natir clapped his slender hands to quiet the crowd, and soon the only sound was that of the soft rain.\r\n\u201CBrightlord Amaram,\u201D Roshone said, nodding to the lighteyed man in the uniform, \u201Cis absendiar highmarshal of our princedom. He is in command of defending our borders while the king and Brightlord Sadeas are away.\u201D\r\nKaladin nodded. Everyone knew of Amaram. He was far more important than most military men who passed through Hearthstone.\r\nAmaram stepped forward to speak.\r\n\u201CYou have a fine town here,\u201D Amaram said to the gathered darkeyes. He had a strong, deep voice. \u201CThank you for hosting me.\u201D\r\nKaladin frowned, glancing at the other townspeople. They seemed as confused as he by the statement.\r\n\u201CNormally,\u201D Amaram said, \u201CI would leave this task to one of my subordinate officers. But as I was visiting with my cousin, I decided to come down in person. It is not so onerous a task that I need delegate it.\u201D\r\n\u201CExcuse me, Brightlord,\u201D said Callins, one of the farmers. \u201CBut what duty is that?\u201D\r\n\u201CWhy, recruitment, good farmer,\u201D Amaram said, nodding to Alaxia, who stepped forward with a sheet of paper strapped to a board. \u201CThe king took most of our armies with him on his quest to fulfill the Vengeance Pact. My forces are undermanned, and it has become necessary to recruit young men from each town or village we pass. I do this with volunteers whenever possible.\u201D\r\nThe townspeople fell still. Boys talked of running off to the army, but few of them would actually do it. Hearthstone\u2019s duty was to provide food.\r\n\u201CMy fighting is not as glorious as the war for vengeance,\u201D Amaram said, \u201Cbut it is our sacred duty to defend our lands. This tour will be for four years, and upon completing your duty, you will receive a war bonus equal to one-tenth your total wages. You may then return, or you may sign up for\u00A0further duty. Distinguish yourself and rise to a high rank, and it could mean an increase of one nahn for you and your children. Are there any volunteers?\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll go,\u201D Jost said, stepping forward.\r\n\u201CMe too,\u201D Abry added.\r\n\u201CJost!\u201D Jost\u2019s mother said, grabbing his arm. \u201CThe crops\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CYour crops are important, darkwoman,\u201D Amaram said, \u201Cbut not nearly as important as the defense of our people. The king sends back riches from the plundered Plains, and the gemstones he has captured can provide food for Alethkar in emergency. You two are both welcome. Are there any others?\u201D\r\nThree more boys from the town stepped forward, and one older man\u2014Harl, who had lost his wife to the scarfever. He was the man whose daughter Kaladin hadn\u2019t been able to save after her fall.\r\n\u201CExcellent,\u201D Amaram said. \u201CAre there any others?\u201D\r\nThe townspeople were still. Oddly so. Many of the boys Kaladin had heard talk so often about joining the army looked away. Kaladin felt his heart beating, and his leg twitched, as if itching to propel him forward.\r\nNo. He was to be a surgeon. Lirin looked at him, and his dark brown eyes displayed hints of deep concern. But when Kaladin didn\u2019t make any moves forward, he relaxed.\r\n\u201CVery well,\u201D Amaram said, nodding to Roshone. \u201CWe will need your list after all.\u201D\r\n\u201CList?\u201D Lirin asked loudly.\r\nAmaram glanced at him. \u201CThe need of our army is great, darkborn. I will take volunteers first, but the army\r\nmustbe replenished. As citylord, my cousin has the duty and honor of deciding which men to send.\u201D\r\n\u201CRead the first four names, Alaxia,\u201D Roshone said, \u201Cand the last one.\u201D\r\nAlaxia looked down at her list, speaking with a dry voice. \u201CAgil, son of Marf. Caull, son of Taleb.\u201D\r\nKaladin looked up at Lirin with apprehension.\r\n\u201CHe can\u2019t take you,\u201D Lirin said. \u201CWe\u2019re of the second nahn and provide an essential function to the town\u2014I as surgeon, you as my only apprentice. By the law, we are exempt from conscription. Roshone knows it.\u201D\r\n\u201CHabrin, son of Arafik,\u201D Alaxia continued. \u201CJorna, son of Loats.\u201D She hesitated, then looked up. \u201CTien, son of Lirin.\u201D\r\nThere was a stillness across the square. Even the rain seemed to hesitate\u00A0for a moment. Then, all eyes turned toward Tien. The boy looked dumbfounded. Lirin was immune as town surgeon, Kaladin immune as his apprentice.\r\nBut not Tien. He was a carpenter\u2019s third apprentice, not vital, not immune.\r\nHesina gripped Tien tightly. \u201CNo!\u201D\r\nLirin stepped in front of them, defensive. Kaladin stood stunned, looking at Roshone. Smiling, self-satisfied Roshone.\r\nWe took his son,Kaladin realized, meeting those beady eyes.\r\nThis is his revenge.\r\n\u201CI\u2026\u201D Tien said. \u201CThe military?\u201D For once, he seemed to lose his confidence, his optimism. His eyes opened wide, and he grew very pale. He fainted when he saw blood. He hated fighting. He was still small and spindly despite his age.\r\n\u201CHe\u2019s too young,\u201D Lirin declared. Their neighbors sidled away, leaving Lirin\u2019s family to stand alone in the rain.\r\nAmaram frowned. \u201CIn the cities, youths as young as eight and nine are accepted into the military.\u201D\r\n\u201CLighteyed sons!\u201D Lirin said. \u201CTo be trained as officers. They aren\u2019t sent into battle!\u201D\r\nAmaram frowned more deeply. He stepped out into the rain, walking up to the family. \u201CHow old are you, son?\u201D he asked Tien.\r\n\u201CHe\u2019s thirteen,\u201D Lirin said.\r\nAmaram glanced at him. \u201CThe surgeon. I\u2019ve heard of you.\u201D He sighed, glancing back at Amaram. \u201CI haven\u2019t the time to engage in your petty, small-town politics, cousin. Isn\u2019t there another boy that will do?\u201D\r\n\u201CIt is my choice!\u201D Roshone insisted. \u201CGiven me by the dictates of law. I send those the town can spare\u2014well, that boy is the\r\nfirstone we can spare.\u201D\r\nLirin stepped forward, eyes full of anger. Highmarshal Amaram caught him by the arm. \u201CDo not do something you would regret, darkborn. Roshone has acted according to the law.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou hid behind the law, sneering at me, surgeon,\u201D Roshone called to Lirin. \u201CWell, now it turns against\r\nyou. Keep those spheres! The look on your face at this moment is worth the price of every one of them!\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2026\u201D Tien said again. Kaladin had never seen the boy so terrified.\r\nKaladin felt powerless. The crowd\u2019s eyes were on Lirin, standing with his arm in the grip of the lighteyed general, locking his gaze with Roshone.\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll make the lad a runner boy for a year or two,\u201D Amaram promised. \u201CHe won\u2019t be in combat. It is the best I can do. Every body is needed in these times.\u201D\r\nLirin slumped, then bowed his head. Roshone laughed, motioning Laral toward the carriage. She didn\u2019t glance at Kaladin as she climbed back in. Roshone followed, and though he was still laughing, his expression had grown hard. Lifeless. Like the dull clouds above. He had his revenge, but his son was still dead and he was still stuck in Hearthstone.\r\nAmaram regarded the crowd. \u201CThe recruits may bring two changes of clothing and up to three stoneweights of other possessions. They\r\nwillbe weighed. Report to the army in two hours and ask for Sergeant Hav.\u201D He turned and followed Roshone.\r\nTien stared after him, pale as a whitewashed building. Kaladin could see his terror at leaving his family. His brother, the one who always made him smile when it rained. It was physically painful for Kaladin to see him so scared. It wasn\u2019t\r\nright. Tien should smile. That was who he was.\r\nHe felt the wooden horse in his pocket. Tien always brought him relief when he felt pained. Suddenly, it occurred to him that there was something he could do in turn.\r\nIt\u2019s time to stop hiding in the room when someone else holds up the globe of light,Kaladin thought.\r\nIt\u2019s time to be a man.\r\n\u201CBrightlord Amaram!\u201D Kaladin yelled.\r\nThe general hesitated, standing on the stepstool into the carriage, one foot in the door. He glanced over his shoulder.\r\n\u201CI want to take Tien\u2019s place,\u201D Kaladin said.\r\n\u201CNot allowed!\u201D Roshone said from inside the carriage. \u201CThe law says I may choose.\u201D\r\nAmaram nodded grimly.\r\n\u201CThen what if you take me\r\nas well,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CCan I volunteer?\u201D That way, at least, Tien wouldn\u2019t be alone.\r\n\u201CKaladin!\u201D Hesina said, grabbing him on one arm.\r\n\u201CIt is allowed,\u201D Amaram said. \u201CI will not turn away any soldier, son. If you want to join, you are welcome.\u201D\r\n\u201CKaladin, no,\u201D Lirin said. \u201CDon\u2019t both of you go. Don\u2019t\u2014\u201D\r\nKaladin looked at Tien, the boy\u2019s face wet beneath his wide-brimmed hat. He shook his head, but his eyes seemed hopeful.\r\n\u201CI volunteer,\u201D Kaladin said, turning back to Amaram. \u201CI\u2019ll go.\u201D\r\n\u201CThen you have two hours,\u201D Amaram said, climbing into the carriage. \u201CSame possession allotment as the others.\u201D\r\nThe carriage door shut, but not before Kaladin got a glimpse of an even\r\nmoresatisfied Roshone. Rattling, the vehicle splashed away, dropping a sheet of water from its roof.\r\n\u201CWhy?\u201D Lirin said, turning back to Kaladin, his voice ragged. \u201CWhy have you done this to me? After all of our plans!\u201D\r\nKaladin turned to Tien. The boy took his arm. \u201CThank you,\u201D Tien whispered. \u201CThank you, Kaladin.\r\nThank you.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve lost both of you,\u201D Lirin said hoarsely, splashing away. \u201CStorm it! Both of you.\u201D He was crying. Kaladin\u2019s mother was crying too. She clutched Tien again.\r\n\u201CFather!\u201D Kaladin said, turning, amazed at how confident he felt.\r\nLirin paused, standing in the rain, one foot in a puddle where rainspren clustered. They inched away from him like vertical slugs.\r\n\u201CIn four years, I will bring him home safely,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CI promise it by the storms and the Almighty\u2019s tenth name itself. I will\r\nbring him back.\u201D\r\nI promise\u2026."

      "ChapterName": "45: SHADESMAR",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\n\u201CYelignar, called Blightwind, was one that could speak like a man, though often his voice was accompanied by the wails of those he consumed.\u201D\r\n\u2014The Unmade were obviously fabrications of folklore. Curiously, most were not considered individuals, but instead personifications of kinds of destruction. This quote is from Traxil, line 33, considered a primary source, though I doubt its authenticity.\r\nThey are an oddly welcoming group, these wild parshmen,Shallan read. It was King Gavilar\u2019s account again, recorded a year before his murder.\r\nIt has now been nearly five months since our first meeting. Dalinar continues to pressure me to return to our homeland, insisting that the expedition has stretched too long.\r\nThe parshmen promise that they will lead me on a hunt for a great-shelled beast they call anulo mas vara,\r\nwhich my scholars say translates roughly to \u201CMonster of the Chasms.\u201D If their descriptions are accurate, these creatures have large gemhearts, and one of their heads would make a truly impressive trophy. They also speak of their terrible gods, and we think they must be referring to several particularly large chasm greatshells.\r\nWe are amazed to find religion among these parshmen. The mounting evidence of a complete parshman society\u2014with civilization, culture, and a unique language\u2014is astounding. My stormwardens have begun calling this people \u201Cthe Parshendi.\u201D It is obvious this group is very different from our ordinary servant parshmen, and may not even be the same race, despite the skin patterns. Perhaps they are distant cousins, as different from ordinary parshmen as Alethi axehounds are from the Selay breed.\r\nThe Parshendi have seen our servants, and are confused by them. \u201CWhere is their music?\u201D Klade will often ask me. I do not know what he means. But our servants do not react to the Parshendi at all, showing no interest in emulating them. This is reassuring.\r\nThe question about music may have to do with the humming and chanting the Parshendi often do. They have an uncanny ability to make music together. I swear that I have left one Parshendi singing to himself, then soon passed another out of earshot of the first, yet singing the very same song\u2014eerily near to the other in tempo, tune, and lyric.\r\nTheir favored instrument is the drum. They are crudely made, with handprints of paint marking the sides. This matches their simple buildings, which they construct of crem and stone. They build them in the craterlike rock formations here at the edge of the Shattered Plains. I ask Klade if they worry about highstorms, but he just laughs. \u201CWhy worry? If the buildings blow down, we can build them again, can we not?\u201D\r\nOn the other side of the alcove, Jasnah\u2019s book rustled as she turned a page. Shallan set aside her own volume, then picked through the books on the desk. Her philosophy training done for the time being, she had returned to her study of King Gavilar\u2019s murder.\r\nShe slid a small volume out from the bottom of the stack: a record dictated by Stormwarden Matain, one of the scholars who had accompanied the king. Shallan flipped through the pages, searching for a specific passage. It was a description of the very first Parshendi hunting party they encountered.\r\nIt happened after we set up beside a deep river in a heavily wooded area. It was an ideal location for a long-term camp, as the dense cobwood trees would protect against highstorm winds, and the river\u2019s gorge eliminated the risk of flooding. His Majesty wisely took my advice, sending scouting parties both upriver and down.\r\nHighprince Dalinar\u2019s scouting party was the first to encounter the strange, untamed parshmen. When he returned to camp with his story, I\u2014like many others\u2014refused to believe his claims. Surely Brightlord Dalinar had simply run across the parshman servants of another expedition like our own.\r\nOnce they visited our camp the next day, their reality could no longer be denied. There were ten of them\u2014parshmen to be sure, but bigger than the familiar ones. Some had skin marbled black and red, and others were marbled white and red, as is more common in Alethkar. They carried magnificent weapons, the bright steel etched with complex decorations, but wore simple clothing of woven narbin cloth.\r\nBefore long, His Majesty became fascinated by these strange parshmen, insisting that I begin a study of their language and society. I\u2019ll admit that my original intent was to expose them as a hoax of some kind. The more we learned, however, the more I came to realize how faulty my original assessment had been.\r\nShallan tapped the page, thinking. Then she pulled out a thick volume, titled\r\nKing Gavilar Kholin, a Biography, published by Gavilar\u2019s widow, Navani, two years before. Shallan flipped through pages, scanning for a particular paragraph.\r\nMy husband was an excellent king\u2014an inspiring leader, an unparalleled duelist, and a genius of battlefield tactics. But he didn\u2019t have a single scholarly finger on his left hand. He never showed an interest in the accounting of highstorms, was bored by talk of science, and ignored fabrials unless they had an obvious use in battle. He was a man built after the classical masculine ideal.\r\n\u201CWhy was he so interested in them?\u201D Shallan said out loud.\r\n\u201CHmmm?\u201D Jasnah asked.\r\n\u201CKing Gavilar,\u201D Shallan said. \u201CYour mother insists in her biography that he wasn\u2019t a scholar.\u201D\r\n\u201CTrue.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut he\r\nwasinterested in the Parshendi,\u201D Shallan said. \u201CEven before he could have known about their Shardblades. According to Matain\u2019s account, he wanted to know about their language, their society, and their music. Was that just embellishment, to make him sound more scholarly to future readers?\u201D\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D Jasnah said, lowering her own book. \u201CThe longer he remained in the Unclaimed Hills, the more fascinated by the Parshendi he became.\u201D\r\n\u201CSo there\u2019s a discrepancy. Why would a man with no prior interest in scholarship suddenly become so obsessed?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D Jasnah said. \u201CI too have wondered about this. But sometimes, people change. When he returned, I was encouraged by his interest; we spent many evenings talking about his discoveries. It was one of the few times when I felt I really connected with my father.\u201D\r\nShallan bit her lip. \u201CJasnah,\u201D she finally asked. \u201CWhy did you assign me to research this event? You\r\nlivedthrough this; you already know everything I\u2019m \u2018discovering.\u2019\u201D\r\n\u201CI feel a fresh perspective may be of value.\u201D Jasnah put down her book, looking over at Shallan. \u201CI don\u2019t intend for you to find specific answers. Instead, I hope that you will notice details I\u2019ve missed. You are coming to see how my father\u2019s personality changed during those months, and that means you are digging deeply. Believe it or not, few others have caught the discrepancy you just did\u2014though many do note his later changes, once he returned to Kholinar.\u201D\r\n\u201CEven so, I feel a little odd studying it. Perhaps I\u2019m still influenced by my tutors\u2019 idea that only the classics are a proper realm of study for young ladies.\u201D\r\n\u201CThe classics do have their place, and I will send you to classical works on occasion, as I did with your study of morality. But I intend such tangents to be adjuncts to your current projects.\r\nThosemust be the focus, not long-lost historical conundrums.\u201D\r\nShallan nodded. \u201CBut Jasnah, aren\u2019t you a\r\nhistorian? Aren\u2019t those long-lost historical conundrums the meat of your field?\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m a Veristitalian,\u201D Jasnah said. \u201CWe search for answers in the past, reconstructing what truly happened. To many, writing a history is not about truth, but about presenting the most flattering picture of themselves and their motives. My sisters and I choose projects that we feel were misunderstood or misrepresented, and in studying them hope to better understand the present.\u201D\r\nWhy, then, are you spending so much time studying folktales and looking for evil spirits?No, Jasnah was searching for something real. Something so important that it drew her away from the Shattered Plains and the fight to avenge her father. She intended to do something with those folktales, and Shallan\u2019s research was part of it, somehow.\r\nThat excited her. It was the sort of thing she\u2019d wanted since she\u2019d been a child, looking through her father\u2019s few books, frustrated that he\u2019d chased off yet another tutor. Here, with Jasnah, Shallan was part of something\u2014and, knowing Jasnah, it was something\r\nbig.\r\nAnd yet,she thought.\r\nTozbek\u2019s ship arrives tomorrow morning. I\u2019ll be leaving.\r\nI need to start complaining. I need to convince Jasnah that this was all so much harder than I anticipated, so that when I leave she won\u2019t be surprised. I need to cry, break down, give up. I need to\u2014\r\n\u201CWhat is Urithiru?\u201D Shallan found herself asking instead.\r\nTo her surprise, Jasnah answered without hesitation. \u201CUrithiru was said to be the center of the Silver Kingdoms, a city that held ten thrones, one for each king. It was the most majestic, most amazing, most important city in all the world.\u201D\r\n\u201CReally? Why hadn\u2019t I heard of it before?\u201D\r\n\u201CBecause it was abandoned even before the Lost Radiants turned against mankind. Most scholars consider it just a myth. The ardents refuse to speak of it, due to its association with the Radiants, and therefore with the first major failure of Vorinism. Much of what we know about the city comes from fragments of lost works quoted by classical scholars. Many of those classical works have, themselves, survived only in pieces. Indeed, the single complete work we have from early years is\r\nThe Way of Kings,and that is only because of the Vanrial\u2019s efforts.\u201D\r\nShallan nodded slowly. \u201CIf there were ruins of a magnificent, ancient city hidden somewhere, Natanatan\u2014unexplored, overgrown, wild\u2014would be the natural place to find them.\u201D\r\n\u201CUrithiru is\r\nnotin Natanatan,\u201D Jasnah said, smiling. \u201CBut it is a good guess, Shallan. Return to your studies.\u201D\r\n\u201CThe weapons,\u201D Shallan said.\r\nJasnah raised an eyebrow.\r\n\u201CThe Parshendi. They carried beautiful weapons of fine, etched steel. Yet they used skin drums with crude handprints on the sides and lived in huts of stone and crem. Doesn\u2019t that strike you as incongruous?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes. I would certainly describe that as an oddity.\u201D\r\n\u201CThen\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CI assure you, Shallan,\u201D Jasnah said. \u201CThe city is not there.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut you\r\nareinterested in the Shattered Plains. You spoke of them with Brightlord Dalinar through the spanreed.\u201D\r\n\u201CI did.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat were the Voidbringers?\u201D Now that Jasnah was actually answering, perhaps she\u2019d say. \u201CWhat were they\r\nreally?\u201D\r\nJasnah studied her with a curious expression. \u201CNobody knows for sure. Most scholars consider them, like Urithiru, mere myths, while theologians accept them as counterparts of the Almighty\u2014monsters that dwelled in the hearts of men, much as the Almighty once lived there.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CReturn to your studies, child,\u201D Jasnah said, raising her book. \u201CPerhaps we will speak of this another time.\u201D\r\nThere was an air of finality about that. Shallan bit her lip, keeping herself from saying something rude just to draw Jasnah back into conversation.\r\nShe doesn\u2019t trust me,she thought. Perhaps with good reason.\r\nYou\u2019re leaving,Shallan told herself again.\r\nTomorrow. You\u2019re sailing away from this.\r\nBut that meant she had only one day left. One more day in the grand Palanaeum. One more day with all of these books, all of this power and knowledge.\r\n\u201CI need a copy of Tifandor\u2019s biography of your father,\u201D Shallan said, poking through the books. \u201CI keep seeing it referenced.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s on one of the bottom floors,\u201D Jasnah said idly. \u201CI might be able to dig out the index number.\u201D\r\n\u201CNo need,\u201D Shallan said, standing. \u201CI\u2019ll look it up. I need the practice.\u201D\r\n\u201CAs you wish,\u201D Jasnah said.\r\nShallan smiled. She knew exactly where the book was\u2014but the pretense of searching for it would give her time away from Jasnah. And during that time, she\u2019d see what she could discover about the Voidbringers on her own.\r\nTwo hours later, Shallan sat at a cluttered desk at the back of one of the Palanaeum\u2019s lower-level rooms, her sphere lantern illuminating a stack of hastily gathered volumes, none of which had proven much use.\r\nIt seemed that everybody knew something about the Voidbringers. People in rural areas spoke of them as mysterious creatures that came out at night, stealing from the unlucky and punishing the foolish. Those Voidbringers seemed more mischievous than evil. But then there would be the odd story about a Voidbringer taking on the form of a wayward traveler who\u2014after receiving kindness from a tallew farmer\u2014would slaughter the entire family, drink their blood, then write voidish symbols across the walls in black ash.\r\nMost people in the cities, however, saw the Voidbringers as spirits who stalked at night, a kind of evil spren that invaded the hearts of men and made them do terrible things. When a good man grew angry, it was the work of a Voidbringer.\r\nScholars laughed at all these ideas. Actual historical accounts\u2014the ones she could find quickly\u2014were contradictory. Were the Voidbringers the denizens of Damnation? If so, wouldn\u2019t Damnation now be empty, as the Voidbringers had conquered the Tranquiline Halls and cast out mankind to Roshar?\r\nI should have known that I\u2019d have trouble finding anything solid,Shallan thought, leaning back in her chair.\r\nJasnah\u2019s been researching this for months, maybe years. What did I expect to find in a few hours?\r\nThe only thing the research had done was increase her confusion. What errant winds had brought Jasnah to this topic? It made no sense. Studying the Voidbringers was like trying to determine if deathspren were real or not. What was the point?\r\nShe shook her head, stacking her books. The ardents would reshelve them for her. She needed to fetch Tifandor\u2019s biography and return to their balcony. She rose and walked toward the room\u2019s exit, carrying her lantern in her freehand. She hadn\u2019t brought a parshman; she intended to carry back only the one book. As she reached the exit, she noticed another light approaching out on the balcony. Just before she arrived, someone stepped up to the doorway, holding aloft a garnet lantern.\r\n\u201CKabsal?\u201D Shallan asked, surprised to see his youthful face, painted blue by the light.\r\n\u201CShallan?\u201D he asked, looking up at the index inscription atop the entryway. \u201CWhat are you doing here? Jasnah said you were looking for Tifandor.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2026got turned around.\u201D\r\nHe raised an eyebrow at her.\r\n\u201CBad lie?\u201D she asked.\r\n\u201CTerrible,\u201D he said. \u201CYou\u2019re two floors up and about a thousand index numbers off. After I couldn\u2019t find you below, I asked the lift porters to take me where they brought you, and they took me here.\u201D\r\n\u201CJasnah\u2019s training can be exhausting,\u201D Shallan said. \u201CSo I sometimes find a quiet corner to relax and compose myself. It\u2019s the only time I get to be alone.\u201D\r\nKabsal nodded thoughtfully.\r\n\u201CBetter?\u201D she asked.\r\n\u201CStill problematic. You took a break, but for\r\ntwo hours? Besides, I remember you telling me that Jasnah\u2019s training wasn\u2019t so terrible.\u201D\r\n\u201CShe\u2019d believe me,\u201D Shallan said. \u201CShe thinks she\u2019s far more demanding than she is. Or\u2026well, she\r\nisdemanding. I just don\u2019t mind as much as she thinks I do.\u201D\r\n\u201CVery well,\u201D he said. \u201CBut what\r\nwereyou doing down here, then?\u201D\r\nShe bit her lip, causing him to laugh.\r\n\u201CWhat?\u201D she demanded, blushing.\r\n\u201CYou just look so blasted\r\ninnocentwhen you do that!\u201D\r\n\u201CI\r\naminnocent.\u201D\r\n\u201CDidn\u2019t you just lie to me twice in a row?\u201D\r\n\u201CInnocent, as in the opposite of sophisticated.\u201D She grimaced. \u201COtherwise, they\u2019d have been more convincing lies. Come. Walk with me while I fetch Tifandor. If we hurry, I won\u2019t have to lie to Jasnah.\u201D\r\n\u201CFair enough,\u201D he said, joining her and strolling around the perimeter of the Palanaeum. The hollow inverted pyramid rose toward the ceiling far above, the four walls expanding outward at a slant. The topmost levels were brighter and easier to make out, tiny lights bobbing along railings in the hands of ardents or scholars.\r\n\u201CFifty-seven levels,\u201D Shallan said. \u201CI can\u2019t even imagine how much work it must have been for you to create all this.\u201D\r\n\u201CWe didn\u2019t create it,\u201D Kabsal said. \u201CIt was here. The main shaft, at least. The Kharbranthians cut out the rooms for the books.\u201D\r\n\u201CThis formation is\r\nnatural?\u201D\r\n\u201CAs natural as cities like Kholinar. Or have you forgotten my demonstration?\u201D\r\n\u201CNo. But why didn\u2019t you use this place as one of your examples?\u201D\r\n\u201CWe haven\u2019t found the right sand pattern yet,\u201D he said. \u201CBut we\u2019re sure the Almighty himself made this place, as he did the cities.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat about the Dawnsingers?\u201D Shallan asked.\r\n\u201CWhat about them?\u201D\r\n\u201CCould they have created it?\u201D\r\nHe chuckled as they arrived at the lift. \u201CThat isn\u2019t the kind of thing the Dawnsingers did. They were healers, kindly spren sent by the Almighty to care for humans once we were forced out of the Tranquiline Halls.\u201D\r\n\u201CKind of like the opposite of the Voidbringers.\u201D\r\n\u201CI suppose you could say that.\r\n\u201CTake us down two levels,\u201D she told the parshman lift porters. They began lowering the platform, the pulleys squeaking and wood shaking beneath her feet.\r\n\u201CIf you think to distract me with this conversation,\u201D Kabsal noted, folding his arms and leaning back against the railing, \u201Cyou won\u2019t be successful. I sat up there with your disapproving mistress for well over an hour, and let me say that it was\r\nnota pleasant experience. I think she knows I still intend to try and convert her.\u201D\r\n\u201COf course she does. She\u2019s Jasnah. She knows practically everything.\u201D\r\n\u201CExcept whatever it is she came here to study.\u201D\r\n\u201CThe Voidbringers,\u201D Shallan said. \u201CThat\u2019s what she\u2019s studying.\u201D\r\nHe frowned. A few moments later, the lift came to a rest on the appropriate floor. \u201CThe Voidbringers?\u201D he said, sounding curious. She\u2019d have expected him to be scornful or amused.\r\nNo,she thought.\r\nHe\u2019s an ardent. He believes in them.\r\n\u201CWhat were they?\u201D she asked, walking out. Not far below, the massive cavern came to a point. There was a large infused diamond there, marking the nadir.\r\n\u201CWe don\u2019t like to talk about it,\u201D Kabsal said as he joined her.\r\n\u201CWhy not? You\u2019re an ardent. This is part of your religion.\u201D\r\n\u201CAn unpopular part. People prefer to hear about the Ten Divine Attributes or the Ten Human Failings. We accommodate them because we, also, prefer that to the deep past.\u201D\r\n\u201CBecause\u2026\u201D she prodded.\r\n\u201CBecause,\u201D he said with a sigh, \u201Cof our failure. Shallan, the devotaries\u2014at their core\u2014are still classical Vorinism. That means the Hierocracy and the fall of the Lost Radiants are\r\nourshame.\u201D He held up his deep blue lantern. Shallan strolled at his side, curious, letting him just talk.\r\n\u201CWe believe that the Voidbringers were\r\nreal, Shallan. A scourge and a plague. A hundred times they came upon mankind. First casting us from the Tranquiline Halls, then trying to destroy us here on Roshar. They weren\u2019t just spren that hid under rocks, then came out to steal someone\u2019s laundry. They were creatures of terrible destructive power, forged in Damnation, created from hate.\u201D\r\n\u201CBy whom?\u201D Shallan asked.\r\n\u201CWhat?\u201D\r\n\u201CWho made them? I mean, the\r\nAlmightywasn\u2019t likely to have \u2018created something from hate.\u2019 So what made them?\u201D\r\n\u201CEverything has its opposite, Shallan. The Almighty is a force of good. To balance his goodness, the cosmere needed the Voidbringers as his opposite.\u201D\r\n\u201CSo the more good that the Almighty did, the more evil he created as a by-product? What\u2019s the point of doing any good at all if it just creates more evil?\u201D\r\n\u201CI see Jasnah has continued your training in philosophy.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s not philosophy,\u201D Shallan said. \u201CThat\u2019s simple logic.\u201D\r\nHe sighed. \u201CI don\u2019t think you want to get into the deep theology of this. Suffice it to say that the Almighty\u2019s pure goodness created the Voidbringers, but\r\nmenmay choose good without creating evil because as mortals they have a dual nature. Thus the only way for good to increase in the cosmere is for men to create it\u2014in that way, good may come to outweigh evil.\u201D\r\n\u201CAll right,\u201D she said. \u201CBut I don\u2019t buy the explanation about the Voidbringers.\u201D\r\n\u201CI thought you were a believer.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\r\nam. But just because I honor the Almighty doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to accept any explanation, Kabsal. It might be religion, but it still has to make sense.\u201D\r\n\u201CDidn\u2019t you once tell me that you didn\u2019t understand your own self?\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, yes.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd yet you expect to be able to understand the exact workings of the\r\nAlmighty?\u201D\r\nShe drew her lips into a line. \u201CAll right, fine. But I still want to know more about the Voidbringers.\u201D\r\nHe shrugged as she guided him into an archive room, filled with shelves of books. \u201CI told you the basics, Shallan. The Voidbringers were an embodiment of evil. We fought them off ninety and nine times, led by the Heralds and their chosen knights, the ten orders we call the Knights Radiant. Finally, Aharietiam came, the Last Desolation. The Voidbringers were cast back into the Tranquiline Halls. The Heralds followed to force them out of heaven as well, and Roshar\u2019s Heraldic Epochs ended. Mankind entered the Era of Solitude. The modern era.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut why is everything from before so fragmented?\u201D\r\n\u201CThis was thousands and thousands of years ago, Shallan,\u201D Kabsal said. \u201CBefore history, before men even knew how to forge steel. We had to be given Shardblades, otherwise we would have had to fight the Voidbringers with clubs.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd yet we had the Silver Kingdoms and the Knights Radiant.\u201D\r\n\u201CFormed and led by the Heralds.\u201D\r\nShallan frowned, counting off rows of shelves. She stopped at the correct one, handed her lantern to Kabsal, then walked down the aisle and plucked the biography off the shelf. Kabsal followed her, holding up the lanterns.\r\n\u201CThere\u2019s more to this,\u201D Shallan said. \u201COtherwise, Jasnah wouldn\u2019t be digging so hard.\u201D\r\n\u201CI can tell you why she\u2019s doing it,\u201D he said.\r\nShallan glanced at him.\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t you see?\u201D he said. \u201CShe\u2019s trying to prove that the Voidbringers weren\u2019t real. She wants to demonstrate that this was all a fabrication of the Radiants.\u201D He stepped forward and turned to face her, the lanternlight rebounding from the books to either side, making his face pale. \u201CShe wants to prove once and for all that the devotaries\u2014and Vorinism\u2014are a gigantic fraud.\r\nThat\u2019swhat this is all about.\u201D\r\n\u201CMaybe,\u201D Shallan said thoughtfully. It did seem to fit. What better goal for an avowed heretic? Undermining foolish beliefs and disproving religion? It explained why Jasnah would study something as seemingly inconsequential as the Voidbringers. Find the right evidence in the historical records, and Jasnah might well be able to prove herself right.\r\n\u201CHaven\u2019t we been scourged enough?\u201D Kabsal said, eyes angry. \u201CThe ardents are no threat to her. We\u2019re not a threat to anyone these days. We can\u2019t own property\u2026Damnation, we\u2019re property\r\nourselves. We dance to the whims of the citylords and warlords, afraid to tell them the truths of their sins for fear of retribution. We\u2019re whitespines without tusks or claws, expected to sit at our master\u2019s feet and offer praise. Yet this is real. It\u2019s\r\nallreal, and they ignore us and\u2014\u201D\r\nHe cut off suddenly, glancing at her, lips tight, jaw clenched. She\u2019d never seen such fervor, such\r\nfuryfrom the pleasant ardent. She wouldn\u2019t have thought him capable of it.\r\n\u201CI\u2019m sorry,\u201D he said, turning from her, leading the way back down the aisle.\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s all right,\u201D she said, hurrying after him, suddenly feeling depressed. Shallan had expected to find something grander, something more mysterious, behind Jasnah\u2019s secretive research. Could it all really just be about proving Vorinism false?\r\nThey walked in silence out to the balcony. And there, she realized she had to tell him. \u201CKabsal, I\u2019m leaving.\u201D\r\nHe looked at her, surprised.\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve had news from my family,\u201D she said. \u201CI can\u2019t speak of it, but I can stay no longer.\u201D\r\n\u201CSomething about your father?\u201D\r\n\u201CWhy? Have you heard something?\u201D\r\n\u201COnly that he\u2019s been reclusive lately. More than normal.\u201D\r\nShe suppressed a flinch. News had gotten this far? \u201CI\u2019m sorry to go so suddenly.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou\u2019ll return?\u201D\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know.\u201D\r\nHe looked into her eyes, searching. \u201CDo you know when you\u2019ll be leaving?\u201D he said in a suddenly cool voice.\r\n\u201CTomorrow morning.\u201D\r\n\u201CWell then,\u201D he said. \u201CWill you at least do me the honor of sketching me? You\u2019ve never given me a likeness, though you\u2019ve done many of the other ardents.\u201D\r\nShe started, realizing that was true. Despite their time together, she\u2019d never done a sketch of Kabsal. She raised her freehand to her mouth. \u201CI\u2019m sorry!\u201D\r\nHe seemed taken aback. \u201CI didn\u2019t mean it bitterly, Shallan. It\u2019s really not that important\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CYes it\r\nis,\u201D she said, grabbing his hand, towing him along the walkway. \u201CI left my drawing things up above. Come on.\u201D She hurried him to the lift, instructing the parshmen to carry them up. As the lift began to rise, Kabsal looked at her hand in his. She dropped it hastily.\r\n\u201CYou\u2019re a very confusing woman,\u201D he said stiffly.\r\n\u201CI warned you.\u201D She held the retrieved book close to her breast. \u201CI believe you said you had me figured out.\u201D\r\n\u201CI rescind that statement.\u201D He looked at her. \u201CYou\u2019re really leaving?\u201D\r\nShe nodded. \u201CI\u2019m sorry. Kabsal\u2026I\u2019m not what you think I am.\u201D\r\n\u201CI think you\u2019re a beautiful, intelligent woman.\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, you have the woman part right.\u201D\r\n\u201CYour father is sick, isn\u2019t he?\u201D\r\nShe didn\u2019t answer.\r\n\u201CI can see why you\u2019d want to return to be with him,\u201D Kabsal said. \u201CBut surely you won\u2019t abandon your wardship forever. You\u2019ll be back with Jasnah.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd she won\u2019t be staying in Kharbranth forever. She\u2019s been moving from place to place almost constantly for the last two years.\u201D\r\nHe looked ahead, staring out the front of the lift as they rose. Soon, they had to transfer to another lift to carry them up the next group of floors. \u201CI shouldn\u2019t have been spending time with you,\u201D he finally said. \u201CThe senior ardents think I\u2019m too distracted. They never like it when one of us starts looking outside the ardentia.\u201D\r\n\u201CYour right to court is protected.\u201D\r\n\u201CWe\u2019re property. A man\u2019s rights can be protected at the same time that he is discouraged from exercising them. I\u2019ve avoided work, I\u2019ve disobeyed my superiors\u2026In courting you, I\u2019ve also courted trouble.\u201D\r\n\u201CI didn\u2019t ask you for any of that.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou didn\u2019t discourage me.\u201D\r\nShe had no response for that, other than to feel a rising worry. A hint of panic, a desire to run away and hide. During her years of near-solitude on her father\u2019s estate, she had never dreamed of a relationship like this one.\r\nIs that what this is?she thought, panic swelling.\r\nA relationship?Her intentions in coming to Kharbranth had seemed so straightforward. How had she gotten to the point where she risked breaking a man\u2019s heart?\r\nAnd, to her shame, she admitted to herself that she would miss the research more than Kabsal. Was she a horrible person for feeling that way? She\r\nwasfond of him. He was pleasant. Interesting.\r\nHe looked at her, and there was longing in his eyes. He seemed\u2026Stormfather, he seemed to really be in love with her. Shouldn\u2019t she be falling in love with him too? She didn\u2019t think she was. She was just confused.\r\nWhen they reached the top of the Palanaeum\u2019s system of lifts, she practically ran out into the Veil. Kabsal followed, but they needed another lift up to Jasnah\u2019s alcove, and soon she found herself trapped with him once more.\r\n\u201CI could come,\u201D Kabsal said softly. \u201CReturn with you to Jah Keved.\u201D\r\nShallan\u2019s panic increased. She barely knew him. Yes, they had chatted frequently, but rarely about the important things. If he left the ardentia, he\u2019d be demoted to tenth dahn, almost as low as a darkeyes. He\u2019d be without money or house, in almost as bad a position as her family.\r\nHer family. What would her brothers say if she brought a virtual stranger back with her? Another man to become part of their problems, privy to their secrets?\r\n\u201CI can see from your expression that it\u2019s not an option,\u201D Kabsal said. \u201CIt seems that I\u2019ve misinterpreted some very important things.\u201D\r\n\u201CNo, it\u2019s not that,\u201D Shallan said quickly. \u201CIt\u2019s just\u2026Oh, Kabsal. How can you expect to make sense of my actions when even\r\nIcan\u2019t make sense of them?\u201D She touched his arm, turning him toward her. \u201CI have been dishonest with you. And with Jasnah. And, most infuriatingly, with myself. I\u2019m sorry.\u201D\r\nHe shrugged, obviously trying to feign nonchalance. \u201CAt least I\u2019ll get a sketch. Won\u2019t I?\u201D\r\nShe nodded as the lift finally shuddered to a halt. She walked down the dark hallway, Kabsal following with the lanterns. Jasnah looked up appraisingly as Shallan entered their alcove, but did not ask why she\u2019d taken so long. Shallan found herself blushing as she gathered her drawing tools. Kabsal hesitated in the doorway. He\u2019d left a basket of bread and jam on the desk. The top of it was still wrapped with a cloth; Jasnah hadn\u2019t touched it, though he always offered her some as a peace offering. Without jam, since Jasnah hated it.\r\n\u201CWhere should I sit?\u201D Kabsal asked.\r\n\u201CJust stand there,\u201D Shallan said, sitting down, propping her sketchpad against her legs and holding it still with her covered safehand. She looked up at him, leaning with one hand against the doorframe. Head shaved, light grey robe draped around him, sleeves short, waist tied with a white sash. Eyes confused. She blinked, taking a Memory, then began to sketch.\r\nIt was one of the most awkward experiences of her life. She didn\u2019t tell Kabsal that he could move, and so he held the pose. He didn\u2019t speak. Perhaps he thought it would spoil the picture. Shallan found her hand shaking as she sketched, though\u2014thankfully\u2014she managed to hold back tears.\r\nTears,she thought, doing the final lines of the wall around Kabsal.\r\nWhy should I cry? I\u2019m not the one who just got rejected. Can\u2019t my emotions make sense once in a while?\r\n\u201CHere,\u201D she said, pulling the page free and holding it up. \u201CIt will smudge unless you spray it with lacquer.\u201D\r\nKabsal hesitated, then walked over, taking the picture in reverent fingers. \u201CIt\u2019s wonderful,\u201D he whispered. He looked up, then hurried to his lantern, opening it and pulling out the garnet broam inside. \u201CHere,\u201D he said, proffering it. \u201CPayment.\u201D\r\n\u201CI can\u2019t take that! For one thing, it\u2019s not yours.\u201D As an ardent, anything Kabsal carried would belong to the king.\r\n\u201CPlease,\u201D Kabsal said. \u201CI want to give you something.\u201D\r\n\u201CThe picture is a gift,\u201D she said. \u201CIf you pay me for it, then I haven\u2019t given you anything.\u201D\r\n\u201CThen I\u2019ll commission another,\u201D he said, pressing the glowing sphere into her fingers. \u201CI\u2019ll take the first likeness for free, but do another for me, please. One of the two of us together.\u201D\r\nShe paused. She rarely did sketches of herself. They felt strange to draw. \u201CAll right.\u201D She took the sphere, then furtively tucked it into her safepouch, beside her Soulcaster. It was a little odd to carry something so heavy there, but she\u2019d gotten accustomed to the bulge and weight.\r\n\u201CJasnah, do you have a mirror?\u201D she asked.\r\nThe other woman sighed audibly, obviously annoyed by the distraction. She felt through her things, taking out a mirror. Kabsal fetched it.\r\n\u201CHold it up beside your head,\u201D Shallan said, \u201Cso I can see myself.\u201D\r\nHe walked back over, doing so, looking confused.\r\n\u201CAngle it to the side a little,\u201D Shallan said, \u201Call right, there.\u201D She blinked, freezing in her mind the image of her face beside his. \u201CHave a seat. You don\u2019t need the mirror any longer. I just wanted it for reference\u2014it helps me for some reason to place my features into the scene I want to sketch. I\u2019ll put myself sitting beside you.\u201D\r\nHe sat on the floor, and Shallan began to work, using it to distract herself from her conflicting emotions. Guilt at not feeling as strongly for Kabsal as he did for her, yet sorrow that she wouldn\u2019t be seeing him anymore. And above it all, anxiety about the Soulcaster.\r\nSketching herself in beside him was challenging. She worked furiously, blending the reality of Kabsal sitting and a fiction of herself, in her flower-embroidered dress, sitting with her legs to the side. The face in the mirror became her reference point, and she built her head around it. Too narrow to be beautiful, with hair too light, cheeks dotted with freckles.\r\nThe Soulcaster,she thought.\r\nBeing here in Kharbranth with it is a danger. But leaving is dangerous too. Could there be a third option? What if I sent it away?\r\nShe hesitated, charcoal pencil hovering above the picture. Dared she send the fabrial\u2014packaged, delivered to Tozbek in secret\u2014back to Jah Keved without her? She wouldn\u2019t have to worry about being incriminated if her room or person were searched, though she\u2019d want to destroy all pictures she\u2019d drawn of Jasnah with the Soulcaster. And she wouldn\u2019t risk suspicion by vanishing when Jasnah discovered her Soulcaster didn\u2019t work.\r\nShe continued her drawing, increasingly withdrawn into her thoughts, letting her fingers work. If she sent the Soulcaster back alone, then she could stay in Kharbranth. It was a golden, tempting prospect, but one that threw her emotions further into a jumbled mess. She\u2019d been preparing herself to leave for so long. What would she do about Kabsal? And Jasnah. Could Shallan really remain here, accepting Jasnah\u2019s freely given tutelage, after what she\u2019d done?\r\nYes,Shallan thought.\r\nYes, I could.\r\nThe fervency of that emotion surprised her. She would live with the guilt, day by day, if it meant continuing to learn. It was terribly selfish of her, and she was ashamed of it. But she would do it for a little longer, at least. She\u2019d have to go back eventually, of course. She couldn\u2019t leave her brothers to face danger alone. They needed her.\r\nSelfishness, followed by courage. She was nearly as surprised by the latter as she had been by the former. Neither was something she often associated with who she was. But she was coming to realize that she hadn\u2019t\r\nknownwho she was. Not until she left Jah Keved and everything familiar, everything she\u2019d been expected to be.\r\nHer sketching grew more and more fervent. She finished the figures and moved to the background. Quick, bold lines became the floor and the archway behind. A scribbled dark smudge for the side of the desk, casting a shadow. Crisp, thin lines for the lantern sitting on the floor. Sweeping, breezelike lines to form the legs and robes of the creature standing behind\u2014\r\nShallan froze, fingers drawing an unintended line of charcoal, breaking away from the figure she\u2019d sketched directly behind Kabsal. A figure that wasn\u2019t really there, a figure with a sharp, angular symbol hovering above its collar instead of a head.\r\nShallan stood, throwing back her chair, sketchpad and charcoal pencil clutched in the fingers of her freehand.\r\n\u201CShallan?\u201D Kabsal said, standing.\r\nShe\u2019d done it again. Why? The peace she\u2019d begun to feel during the sketching evaporated in a heartbeat, and her heart started to race. The pressures returned. Kabsal. Jasnah. Her brothers. Decisions, choices, problems.\r\n\u201CIs everything all right?\u201D Kabsal said, taking a step toward her.\r\n\u201CI\u2019m sorry,\u201D she said. \u201CI\u2014I made a mistake.\u201D\r\nHe frowned. To the side, Jasnah looked up, brow wrinkled.\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s all right,\u201D Kabsal said. \u201CLook, let\u2019s have some bread and jam. We can calm down, then you could finish it. I don\u2019t care about a\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CI need to go,\u201D Shallan cut in, feeling suffocated. \u201CI\u2019m sorry.\u201D\r\nShe brushed past the dumbfounded ardent, hurrying from the alcove, giving a wide berth to the place where the figure stood in her sketch. What was\r\nwrongwith her?\r\nShe rushed to the lift, calling for the parshmen to lower her. She glanced over her shoulder. Kabsal stood in the hallway, looking after her. Shallan reached the lift, drawing pad clutched in her hand, her heart racing.\r\nCalm yourself,she thought, leaning back against the lift platform\u2019s wooden railing as the parshmen began to take her down. She looked up at the empty landing above her.\r\nAnd found herself blinking, memorizing that scene. She began sketching again.\r\nShe drew with concise motions, sketchpad held against her safearm. For illumination, she had just two very small spheres at either side, where the taut ropes quivered. She moved without thought, just\r\ndrawing, staring upward.\r\nShe looked down at what she had drawn. Two figures stood on the landing above, wearing the too-straight robes, like cloth made from metal. They leaned down, watching her go.\r\nShe looked up again. The landing was empty.\r\nWhat\u2019s happening to me?she thought with increasing horror. When the lift hit the ground, she scrambled away, her skirt fluttering. She all but ran to the exit of the Veil, hesitating beside the doorway, ignoring the master-servants and ardents who gave her confused looks.\r\nWhere to go? Sweat trickled down the sides of her face. Where to run when you were going mad?\r\nShe cut into the main cavern\u2019s crowd. It was late afternoon, and the dinner rush had begun\u2014servants pushing dining carts, lighteyes strolling to their rooms, scholars walking with hands behind their backs. Shallan dashed through their midst, her hair coming free of its bun, the hairspike dropping to the rock behind her with a high-pitched clink. Her loose red hair streamed behind. She reached the hallway leading to their rooms, panting, hair askew, and glanced over her shoulder. Amid the flow of traffic she\u2019d left a trail of people looking after her in confusion.\r\nAlmost against her will, she blinked and took a Memory. She raised her pad again, gripping her charcoal pencil in slick fingers, quickly sketching the crowded cavern scene. Just faint impressions. Men of lines, women of curves, walls of sloping rock, carpeted floor, bursts of light in sphere lanterns on the walls.\r\nAnd five symbol-headed figures in black, too-stiff robes and cloaks. Each had a different symbol, twisted and unfamiliar to her, hanging above a neckless torso. The creatures wove through the crowd unseen. Like predators. Focused on Shallan.\r\nI\u2019m just imagining it,she tried to tell herself.\r\nI\u2019m overtaxed, too many things weighing on me.Did they represent her guilt? The stress of betraying Jasnah and lying to Kabsal? The things she had done before leaving Jah Keved?\r\nShe tried to stand there, waiting, but her fingers refused to remain still. She blinked, then started drawing again on a new sheet. She finished with a shaking hand. The figures were almost to her, angular not-heads hanging horrifically where faces should have been.\r\nLogic warned that she was overreacting, but no matter what she told herself, she couldn\u2019t believe it. These were\r\nreal. And they were coming for her.\r\nShe dashed away, surprising several servants who had been approaching her to offer assistance. She ran, slippered feet sliding on the hallway carpets, eventually reaching the door to Jasnah\u2019s rooms. Sketchpad under her arm, she unlocked it with quivering fingers, then pushed through and slammed it behind her. She locked it again and ran for her chamber. She slammed that door closed too, then turned, backing away. The only light in the room came from the three diamond marks in the large crystal goblet on her nightstand.\r\nShe got on the bed, then scrambled back as far from the door as she could, until she was against the wall, breathing through her nose with frantic breaths. She still had her sketchpad under her arm, though she\u2019d lost the charcoal. There was more in her nightstand.\r\nDon\u2019t do it,she thought.\r\nJust sit and calm yourself.\r\nShe felt a growing chill, a rising terror. She\r\nhadto know. She scrambled to pull out the charcoal, then blinked and began to sketch her room.\r\nCeiling first. Four straight lines. Down the walls. Lines at the corners. Her fingers kept moving, drawing, depicting the pad itself, held before her, safehand shrouded and bracing the pad from behind. And then on. To the beings standing around her\u2014twisted symbols unconnected to their uneven shoulders. Those not-heads had unreal angles, surfaces that melded in weird, impossible ways.\r\nThe creature at the front was reaching too-smooth fingers toward Shallan. Just inches from the right side of the sketchpad.\r\nOh, Stormfather\u2026Shallan thought, charcoal pencil falling still. The room was empty, yet depicted right in front of her was an image of it crowded full of sleek figures. They were close enough that she should be able to feel them breathing, if they breathed.\r\nWas there a chill in the room? Hesitantly\u2014terrified but unable to stop herself\u2014Shallan dropped her pencil and raised her freehand to the right.\r\nAnd felt something.\r\nShe screamed then, jumping to her feet on her bed, dropping the pad, backing against the wall. Before she could consciously think of what she was doing, she was struggling with her sleeve, trying to get the Soulcaster out. It was the only thing she had resembling a weapon. No, that was stupid. She didn\u2019t know how to use it. She was helpless.\r\nExcept\u2026\r\nStorms!she thought, frantic.\r\nI can\u2019t use that. I promised myself.\r\nShe began the process anyway. Ten heartbeats, to bring forth the fruit of her sin, the proceeds of her most horrific act. She was interrupted midway through by a voice, uncanny yet distinct:\r\nWhat are you?\r\nShe clutched her hand to her chest, losing her balance on the soft bed, falling to her knees on the rumpled blanket. She put one hand to the side, steadying herself on the nightstand, fingers brushing the large glass goblet that sat there.\r\n\u201CWhat am I?\u201D she whispered. \u201CI\u2019m terrified.\u201D\r\nThis is true.\r\nThe bedroom transformed around her.\r\nThe bed, the nightstand, her sketchpad, the walls, the ceiling\u2014everything seemed to\r\npop, forming into tiny, dark glass spheres. She found herself in a place with a black sky and a strange, small white sun that hung on the horizon, too far away.\r\nShallan screamed as she found herself in midair, falling backward in a shower of beads. Flames hovered nearby, dozens of them, perhaps hundreds. Like the tips of candles floating in the air and moving in the wind.\r\nShe hit something. An endless dark sea, except it wasn\u2019t wet. It was made of the small beads, an entire ocean of tiny glass spheres. They surged around her, moving in an undulating swell. She gasped, flailing, trying to stay afloat.\r\nYou want me to change?a warm voice said in her mind, distinct and different from the cold whisper she had heard earlier. It was deep and hollow and conveyed a sense of great age. It seemed to come from her hand, and she realized she was grasping something there. One of the beads.\r\nThe movement of the ocean of glass threatened to tow her down; she kicked frantically, somehow managing to stay afloat.\r\nI\u2019ve been as I am for a great long time,the warm voice said.\r\nI sleep so much. I will change. Give me what you have.\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know what you mean! Please, help me!\u201D\r\nI will change.\r\nShe felt suddenly cold, as if the warmth were being drawn from her. She screamed as the bead in her fingers flared to sudden warmth. She dropped it just as a shift in the ocean swell towed her under, beads rolling over one another with a soft clatter.\r\nShe fell back and hit her bed, back in her room. Beside her, the goblet on her nightstand\r\nmelted, the glass becoming red liquid, dropping the three spheres inside to the nightstand\u2019s flooded top. The red liquid poured over the sides of the nightstand, splashing to the floor. Shallan pulled back, horrified.\r\nThe goblet had been changed into blood.\r\nHer shocked motion thumped the nightstand, shaking it. An empty glass water pitcher had been sitting beside the goblet. Her motion knocked it over, toppling it to the ground. It shattered on the stone floor, splashing the blood.\r\nThat was a Soulcasting!she thought. She\u2019d changed the goblet into blood, which was one of the Ten Essences. She raised her hand to her head, staring at the red liquid expanding in a pool on her floor. There seemed to be quite a lot of it.\r\nShe was so bewildered. The voice, the creatures, the sea of glass beads and the dark, cold sky. It had all come upon her so quickly.\r\nI Soulcast,she realized again.\r\nI did it!\r\nDid it have something to do with the creatures? But she\u2019d begun seeing them in her drawings before she\u2019d ever stolen the Soulcaster. How\u2026what\u2026? She looked down at her safehand and the Soulcaster hidden in the pouch inside her sleeve.\r\nI didn\u2019t put it on,she thought.\r\nYet I used it anyway.\r\n\u201CShallan?\u201D\r\nIt was Jasnah\u2019s voice. Just outside Shallan\u2019s room. The princess must have followed her. Shallan felt a spike of terror as she saw a line of blood leaking toward the doorway. It was almost there, and would pass underneath in a heartbeat.\r\nWhy did it have to be blood? Nauseated, she leaped to her feet, slippers soaking up the red liquid.\r\n\u201CShallan?\u201D Jasnah said, voice closer. \u201CWhat was that sound?\u201D\r\nShallan looked frantically at the blood, then at the sketchpad, filled with pictures of the strange creatures. What if they\r\ndidhave something to do with the Soulcasting? Jasnah would recognize them. There was a shadow under the door.\r\nShe panicked, tucking the sketchpad away in her trunk. But the blood,\r\nitwould condemn her. There was enough that only a life-threatening wound could have created it. Jasnah would see. She\u2019d know. Blood where there should be none? One of the Ten Essences?\r\nJasnah was going to know what Shallan had done!\r\nA thought struck Shallan. It wasn\u2019t a brilliant thought, but it was a way out, and it was the only thing that occurred to her. She went to her knees and grabbed a shard of the broken glass pitcher in her safehand, through the fabric of her sleeve. She took a breath and pulled up her right sleeve, then used the glass to cut a shallow gash in her skin. In the panic of the moment, it barely even hurt. Blood welled out.\r\nAs the doorknob turned and the door opened, Shallan dropped the glass shard and lay on her side. She closed her eyes, feigning unconsciousness. The door swung open.\r\nJasnah gasped, immediately calling for help. She rushed to Shallan\u2019s side, grabbing her arm and putting pressure on the wound. Shallan mumbled, as if she were barely conscious, gripping her safepouch\u2014and the Soulcaster inside\u2014with her safehand. They wouldn\u2019t open it, would they? She pulled her arm closer to her chest, cowering silently as more footsteps and calls sounded, servants and parshmen running into the room, Jasnah shouting for more help.\r\nThis,Shallan thought,\r\nwill not end well."

      "ChapterName": "46: CHILD OF TANAVAST",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\n\u201CThough I was due for dinner in Veden City that night, I insisted upon visiting Kholinar to speak with Tivbet. The tariffs through Urithiru were growing quite unreasonable. By then, the so-called Radiants had already begun to show their true nature.\u201D\r\n\u2014Following the firing of the original Palanaeum, only one page of Terxim\u2019s autobiography remained, and this is the only line of any use to me.\r\nKaladin dreamed he was the storm.\r\nHe raged forward, the stormwall behind him his trailing cape, soaring above a heaving, black expanse. The ocean. His passing churned up a tempest, slamming waves into one another, lifting white caps to be caught in his wind.\r\nHe approached a dark continent and soared upward. Higher. Higher. He left the sea behind. The vastness of the continent spread out before him, seemingly endless, an ocean of rock.\r\nSo large,he thought, awed. He hadn\u2019t understood. How could he have?\r\nHe roared past the Shattered Plains. They looked as if something very large had hit them at the center, sending rippling breaks outward. They too were larger than he\u2019d expected; no wonder nobody had been able to find their way through the chasms.\r\nThere was a large plateau at the center, but with the darkness and the distance, he could not see much. There were lights, though. Someone lived there.\r\nHe did see that the eastern side of the plains was very different from the western side, marked by tall, spindly pillars, plateaus that had nearly been worn away. Despite that, he could see a symmetry to the Shattered Plains. From high above, the plains resembled a work of art.\r\nIn a moment, he was past them, continuing north and west to soar across the Sea of Spears, a shallow inland sea where broken fingers of rock jutted above the water. He passed over Alethkar, catching a glimpse of the great city of Kholinar, built amid formations of rock like fins rising from the stone. Then he turned southward, away from anything he knew. He crested majestic mountains, densely populated at their tips, with villages clustered near vents that emitted steam or lava. The Horneater Peaks?\r\nHe left them with rain and winds, rumbling down into foreign lands. He passed cities and open plains, villages and twisting waterways. There were many armies. Kaladin passed tents pulled flat against the leeward sides of rock formations, stakes driven into the rock to hold them taut, men hidden inside. He passed hillsides where soldiers huddled in clefts. He passed large wooden wagons, built to house lighteyes while at war. How many wars was the world fighting? Was there nowhere that was at peace?\r\nHe took a path to the southwest, blowing toward a city built in long troughs in the ground that looked like giant claw marks ripped across the landscape. He was over it in a flash, passing a hinterland where the stone itself was ribbed and rippled, like frozen waves of water. The people in this kingdom were dark-skinned, like Sigzil.\r\nThe land went on and on. Hundreds of cities. Thousands of villages. People with faintly blue veins beneath their skin. A place where the pressure of the approaching highstorm blew water out of spouts in the ground. A city where people lived in gigantic, hollowed-out stalactites hanging beneath a titanic sheltered ridge.\r\nWestward he blew. The land was so vast. So enormous. So many different people. It dazzled his mind. War seemed far less prevalent in the West than it was in the East, and that comforted him, but still he was troubled. Peace seemed a scarce commodity in the world.\r\nSomething drew his attention. Strange flashes of light. He blew toward them at the forefront of the storm. What\r\nwerethose lights? They came in bursts, forming the strangest patterns. Almost like physical things that he could reach out and touch, spherical bubbles of light that vibrated with spikes and troughs.\r\nKaladin crossed a strange city laid out in a triangular pattern, with tall peaks rising like sentries at the corners and center. The flashes of light were coming from a building on the central peak. Kaladin knew he would pass quickly, for as the storm, he could not retreat. Ever westward he blew.\r\nHe threw open the door with his wind, entering a long hallway with bright red tile walls, mosaic murals that he passed too quickly to make out. He rustled the skirts of tall, golden-haired serving women who carried trays of food or steaming towels. They called in a strange language, perhaps wondering who had left a window unbarred in a highstorm.\r\nThe flashes of light came from directly ahead. So transfixing. Brushing past a pretty gold-and red-haired woman who huddled frightened in a corner, Kaladin burst through a door. He had one brief glimpse of what lay beyond.\r\nA man stood over two corpses. His pale head shaved, his clothing white, the murderer held a long, thin sword in one hand. He looked up from his victims and almost seemed to\r\nseeKaladin. He had large Shin eyes.\r\nIt was too late to see anything more. Kaladin blew out the window, throwing shutters wide and streaking into the night.\r\nMore cities, mountains, and forests passed in a blur. At his advent, plants curled up their leaves, rockbuds closed their shells, and shrubs withdrew their branches. Before long, he neared the western ocean.\r\nC\r\nHILD OFT\r\nANAVAST. C\r\nHILD OFH\r\nONOR. C\r\nHILD OF ONE LONG SINCE DEPARTED. The sudden voice shook Kaladin; he floundered in the air.\r\nT\r\nHEO\r\nOATHPACT WAS SHATTERED.\r\nThe booming sound made the stormwall itself vibrate. Kaladin hit the ground, separating from the storm. He skidded to a stop, feet throwing up sprays of water. Stormwinds crashed into him, but he was enough a part of them that they neither tossed nor shook him.\r\nM\r\nEN RIDE THE STORMS NO LONGER. The voice was thunder, crashing in the air. T\r\nHEO\r\nOATHPACT IS BROKEN, C\r\nHILD OFH\r\nONOR.\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t understand!\u201D Kaladin screamed into the tempest.\r\nA face formed before him, the face he had seen before, the aged face as wide as the sky, its eyes full of stars.\r\nO\r\nDIUM COMES. M\r\nOST DANGEROUS OF ALL THE SIXTEEN. Y\r\nOU WILL NOW GO.\r\nSomething blew against him. \u201CWait!\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CWhy is there so much war? Must we always fight?\u201D He wasn\u2019t sure why he asked. The questions simply came out.\r\nThe storm rumbled, like a thoughtful aged father. The face vanished, shattering into droplets of water.\r\nMore softly, the voice answered, O\r\nDIUM REIGNS.\r\nKaladin gasped as he awoke. He was surrounded by dark figures, holding him down against the hard stone floor. He yelled, old reflexes taking over. Instinctively, he snapped his hands outward to the sides, each grabbing an ankle and jerking to pull two assailants off balance.\r\nThey cursed, crashing to the ground. Kaladin used the moment to twist while bringing an arm up in a sweep. He knocked free the hands pushing him down, rocked and threw himself forward, lurching into the man directly in front of him.\r\nKaladin rolled over him, tucking and coming up on his feet, free of his captives. He spun, flinging sweat from his brow. Where was his spear? He clutched for the knife at his belt.\r\nNo knife. No spear.\r\n\u201CStorm you, Kaladin!\u201D That was Teft.\r\nKaladin raised a hand to his breast, breathing deliberately, dispelling the strange dream. Bridge Four. He was with Bridge Four. The king\u2019s stormwardens had predicted a highstorm in the early morning hours.\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s all right,\u201D he said to the cursing, twisting clump of bridgemen who had been holding him down. \u201CWhat were you doing?\u201D\r\n\u201CYou tried to go out in the storm,\u201D Moash said accusingly, extricating himself. The only light was a single diamond sphere one of the men had set in the corner.\r\n\u201CHa!\u201D Rock added, standing up and brushing himself off. \u201CHad the door open to the rain, staring out, as if you\u2019d been hit on the head with stone. We had to pull you back. Is not good for you to spend another two weeks sick in bed, eh?\u201D\r\nKaladin calmed himself. The riddens\u2014the quiet rainfall at the trailing end of a highstorm\u2014continued outside, drops sprinkling the roof.\r\n\u201CYou wouldn\u2019t wake up,\u201D Sigzil said. Kaladin glanced at the Azish man, sitting with his back to the stone wall. He hadn\u2019t tried to hold Kaladin down. \u201CYou were having some kind of fever dream.\u201D\r\n\u201CI feel just fine,\u201D Kaladin said. That wasn\u2019t quite true; his head ached and he was exhausted. He took a deep breath and threw back his shoulders, trying to force the fatigue away.\r\nThe sphere in the corner flickered. Then its light faded away, leaving them in darkness.\r\n\u201CStorm it!\u201D Moash muttered. \u201CThat eel Gaz. He\u2019s been giving us dun spheres again.\u201D\r\nKaladin crossed the pitch-black barrack, stepping carefully. His headache faded away as he felt for the door. He pushed it open, letting in the faint light of an overcast morning.\r\nThe winds were weak, but the rain still fell. He stepped out, and was shortly soaked through. The other bridgemen followed him out, and Rock tossed Kaladin a small chunk of soap. Like most of the others, Kaladin wore only his loincloth, and he lathered himself up in the cold downpour. The soap smelled of oil and was gritty with the sand suspended in it. No sweet, soft soaps for bridgemen.\r\nKaladin tossed the bit of soap to Bisig, a thin bridgeman with an angular face. He took it gratefully\u2014Bisig didn\u2019t say much\u2014and began to lather up as Kaladin let the rain wash the soap from his body and hair. To the side, Rock was using a bowl of water to shave and trim his Horneater beard, long on the sides and covering the cheeks, but clean below the lips and chin. It made an odd counterpoint to his head, which he shaved up the center, from directly above the eyebrows back. He trimmed the rest of his hair short.\r\nRock\u2019s hand was smooth and careful, and he didn\u2019t so much as nick himself. Once finished, he stood up and waved to the men waiting behind him. One by one, he shaved any who wanted it. He occasionally paused to sharpen the razor using his whetstone and leather strop.\r\nKaladin raised his fingers to his own beard. He hadn\u2019t been clean-shaven since he\u2019d been in Amaram\u2019s army, so long ago. He walked forward to join those waiting in line. When Kaladin\u2019s time came, the large Horneater laughed. \u201CSit, my friend, sit! Is good you have come. Your face is more like scragglebark branches than a proper beard.\u201D\r\n\u201CShave it clean,\u201D Kaladin said, sitting down on the stump. \u201CAnd I\u2019d rather not have a strange pattern like yours.\u201D\r\n\u201CHa!\u201D Rock said, sharpening his razor. \u201CYou are a lowlander, my good friend. Is not right for you to wear a\r\nhumaka\u2019aban. I would have to thump you soundly if you tried this thing.\u201D\r\n\u201CI thought you said fighting was beneath you.\u201D\r\n\u201CIs allowed several important exceptions,\u201D Rock said. \u201CNow stop with your talking, unless you wish to be losing a lip.\u201D\r\nRock began by trimming the beard down, then lathered and shaved, starting at the left cheek. Kaladin had never let another shave him before; when he\u2019d first gone to war, he\u2019d been young enough that he\u2019d barely needed to shave at all. He\u2019d grown into doing it himself as he got older.\r\nRock\u2019s touch was deft, and Kaladin didn\u2019t feel any nicks or cuts. In a few minutes, Rock stood back. Kaladin raised his fingers to his chin, touching smooth, sensitive skin. His face felt cold, strange to the touch. It took him back, transformed him\u2014just a little\u2014into the man he had been.\r\nStrange, how much difference a shave could make.\r\nI should have done this weeks ago.\r\nThe riddens had turned to drizzle, heralding the storm\u2019s last whispers. Kaladin stood up, letting the water wash bits of shorn hair from his chest. Baby-faced Dunny\u2014the last of those waiting\u2014sat down for his turn at being shaven. He hardly needed it at all.\r\n\u201CThe shave suits you,\u201D a voice said. Kaladin turned to see Sigzil leaning against the wall of the barrack, just under the roof\u2019s overhang. \u201CYour face has strong lines. Square and firm, with a proud chin. We would call it a leader\u2019s face among my people.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m no lighteyes,\u201D Kaladin said, spitting to the side.\r\n\u201CYou hate them so much.\u201D\r\n\u201CI hate their lies,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CI hate it that I used to believe they were honorable.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd would you cast them down?\u201D Sigzil asked, sounding curious. \u201CRule in their place?\u201D\r\n\u201CNo.\u201D\r\nThis seemed to surprise Sigzil. To the side, Syl finally appeared, having finished frolicking in the winds of the highstorm. He always worried\u2014just a little\u2014that she\u2019d ride away with them and leave him.\r\n\u201CHave you no thirst to punish those who have treated you so?\u201D Sigzil asked.\r\n\u201COh, I\u2019m happy to punish them,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CBut I have no desire to take their place, nor do I wish to join them.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019d join them in a heartbeat,\u201D Moash said, walking up behind. He folded his arms across his lean, well-muscled chest. \u201CIf I were in charge, things would change. The lighteyes would work the mines and the fields. They would run bridges and die by Parshendi arrows.\u201D\r\n\u201CWon\u2019t happen,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CBut I won\u2019t blame you for trying.\u201D\r\nSigzil nodded thoughtfully. \u201CHave either of you ever heard of the land of Babatharnam?\u201D\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D Kaladin said, glancing toward the camp. The soldiers were moving about now. More than a few were washing too. \u201CThat a funny name for a country, though.\u201D\r\nSigzil sniffed. \u201CPersonally, I always thought Alethkar sounded like a ridiculous name. I guess it depends on where you were raised.\u201D\r\n\u201CSo why bring up Babab\u2026\u201D Moash said.\r\n\u201CBabatharnam,\u201D Sigzil said. \u201CI visited there once, with my master. They have very peculiar trees. The entire plant\u2014trunk and all\u2014lies down when a highstorm approaches, as if built on hinges. I was thrown in prison three times during our visit there. The Babath are quite particular about how you speak. My master was quite displeased at the amount he had to pay to free me. Of course, I think they were using any excuse to imprison a foreigner, as they knew my master had deep pockets.\u201D He smiled wistfully. \u201COne of those imprisonments\r\nwasmy fault. The women there, you see, have these patterns of veins that sit shallowly beneath their skin. Some visitors find it unnerving, but I found the patterns beautiful. Almost irresistible\u2026\u201D\r\nKaladin frowned. Hadn\u2019t he seen something like that in his dream?\r\n\u201CI bring up Babath because they have a curious system of rule there,\u201D Sigzil continued. \u201CYou see, the elderly are given office. The older you are, the more authority you have. Everyone gets a chance to rule, if they live long enough. The king is called the Most Ancient.\u201D\r\n\u201CSounds fair,\u201D Moash said, walking over to join Sigzil beneath the overhang. \u201CBetter than deciding who rules based on eye color.\u201D\r\n\u201CAh yes,\u201D Sigzil said. \u201CThe Babath are very fair. Currently, the Monavakah Dynasty reigns.\u201D\r\n\u201CHow can you have a dynasty if you choose your leaders based on their age?\u201D Kaladin asked.\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s actually quite easy,\u201D Sigzil said. \u201CYou just execute anyone who gets old enough to challenge you.\u201D\r\nKaladin felt a chill. \u201CThey\r\ndothat?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes, unfortunately,\u201D Sigzil said. \u201CThere is a great deal of unrest in Babatharnam. It was dangerous to visit when we did. The Monavakahs make very certain that\r\ntheirfamily members live the longest; for fifty years, no one outside their family has become Most Ancient. All others have fallen through assassination, exile, or death on the battlefield.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s horrible,\u201D Kaladin said.\r\n\u201CI doubt many would disagree. But I mention these horrors for a purpose. You see, it has been my experience that no matter where you go, you will find some who abuse their power.\u201D He shrugged. \u201CEye color is not so odd a method, compared to many others I have seen. If you were to overthrow the lighteyes and place yourselves in power, Moash, I doubt that the world would be a very different place. The abuses would still happen. Simply to other people.\u201D\r\nKaladin nodded slowly, but Moash shook his head. \u201CNo. I\u2019d change the world, Sigzil. And I mean to.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd how are you going to do that?\u201D Kaladin asked, amused.\r\n\u201CI came to this war to get myself a Shardblade,\u201D Moash said. \u201CAnd I still mean to do it, somehow.\u201D He blushed, then turned away.\r\n\u201CYou joined up assuming they\u2019d make you a spearman, didn\u2019t you?\u201D Kaladin asked.\r\nMoash hesitated, then nodded. \u201CSome of those who joined with me did become soldiers, but most of us got sent to the bridge crews.\u201D He glanced at Kaladin, expression growing dark. \u201CThis plan of yours had better work, lordling. Last time I ran away, I got a beating. I was told if I tried again, I\u2019d get a slave\u2019s mark instead.\u201D\r\n\u201CI never promised it would work, Moash. If you\u2019ve got a better idea, go ahead and share it.\u201D\r\nMoash hesitated. \u201CWell, if you really do teach us the spear like you promised, then I guess I don\u2019t care.\u201D\r\nKaladin glanced about, warily checking to see if Gaz or any bridgemen from other crews were nearby. \u201CKeep quiet,\u201D Kaladin muttered to Moash. \u201CDon\u2019t speak of that outside of the chasms.\u201D The rain had almost stopped; soon the clouds would break.\r\nMoash glared at him, but remained silent.\r\n\u201CYou don\u2019t really think they\u2019d let you have a Shardblade, do you?\u201D Sigzil said.\r\n\u201CAny man can win a Shardblade.\u201D Moash said. \u201CSlave or free. Lighteyes or dark. It\u2019s the law.\u201D\r\n\u201CAssuming they follow the law,\u201D Kaladin said with a sigh.\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll do it somehow,\u201D Moash repeated. He glanced to the side, where Rock was closing up his razor and wiping the rainwater from his bald head.\r\nThe Horneater approached them. \u201CI have heard of this place you spoke of, Sigzil,\u201D Rock said. \u201CBabatharnam. My cousin cousin cousin visited there one time. They have very tasty snails.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat is a long distance to travel for a Horneater,\u201D Sigzil noted.\r\n\u201CNearly same distance as for an Azish,\u201D Rock said. \u201CActually, much more, since you have such little legs!\u201D\r\nSigzil scowled.\r\n\u201CI have seen your kind before,\u201D Rock said, folding his arms.\r\n\u201CWhat?\u201D Sigzil asked. \u201CAzish? We are not so rare.\u201D\r\n\u201CNo, not your race,\u201D Rock said. \u201CYour type. What is it they are called? Visiting places around the land, telling others of what they have seen? A Worldsinger. Yes, is the right name. No?\u201D\r\nSigzil froze. Then he suddenly stood up straight and stalked away from the barrack without looking back.\r\n\u201CNow why is he acting like this thing?\u201D Rock asked. \u201CI am not ashamed of being cook. Why is he ashamed of being Worldsinger?\u201D\r\n\u201CWorldsinger?\u201D Kaladin asked.\r\nRock shrugged. \u201CI do not know much. Are strange people. Say they must travel to each kingdom and tell the people there of other kingdoms. Is a kind of storyteller, though they are thinking of themselves as much more.\u201D\r\n\u201CHe\u2019s probably some kind of brightlord in his country,\u201D Moash said. \u201CThe way he talks. Wonder how he ended up with us cremlings.\u201D\r\n\u201CHey,\u201D Dunny said, joining them. \u201CWhat\u2019d you do to Sigzil? He promised to tell me about my homeland.\u201D\r\n\u201CHomeland?\u201D Moash said to the younger man. \u201CYou\u2019re from Alethkar.\u201D\r\n\u201CSigzil said these violet eyes of mine aren\u2019t native to Alethkar. He thinks I must have Veden blood in me.\u201D\r\n\u201CYour eyes aren\u2019t violet,\u201D Moash said.\r\n\u201CSure they are,\u201D Dunny said. \u201CYou can see it in bright sunlight. They\u2019re just really dark.\u201D\r\n\u201CHa!\u201D Rock said. \u201CIf you are from Vedenar, we are cousins! The Peaks are near Vedenar. Sometimes the people there have good red hair, like us!\u201D\r\n\u201CBe glad that someone didn\u2019t mistake your eyes for red, Dunny,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CMoash, Rock, go gather your subsquads and pass the word to Teft and Skar. I want the men oiling their vests and sandals against the humidity.\u201D\r\nThe men sighed, but did as ordered. The army provided the oil. While the bridgemen were expendable, good hogshide and metal for buckles were not cheap.\r\nAs the men gathered to work, the sun broke through the clouds. The warmth of the light felt good on Kaladin\u2019s rain-wet skin. There was something refreshing about the chill of a highstorm followed by the sun. Tiny rockbud polyps on the side of the building opened, drinking in the wet air. Those would have to be scraped free. Rockbuds would eat away the stone of the walls, creating pockmarks and cracks.\r\nThe buds were a deep crimson. It was Chachel, third day of the week. The slave markets would show new wares. That would mean new bridgemen. Kaladin\u2019s crew was in serious danger. Yake had caught an arrow in the arm during their last run, and Delp had caught one in the neck. There\u2019d been nothing Kaladin could do for him, and with Yake wounded, Kaladin\u2019s team was down to twenty-eight bridge-capable members.\r\nSure enough, about an hour into their morning activities\u2014caring for equipment, oiling the bridge, Lopen and Dabbid running to fetch their morning gruel pot and bring it back to the lumberyard\u2014Kaladin caught sight of soldiers leading a line of dirty, shuffling men toward the lumberyard. Kaladin gestured to Teft, and the two of them marched up to meet Gaz.\r\n\u201CAfore you yell at me,\u201D Gaz said as Kaladin arrived, \u201Cunderstand that I can\u2019t change anything here.\u201D The slaves were bunched up, watched over by a pair of soldiers in wrinkled green coats.\r\n\u201CYou\u2019re bridge sergeant,\u201D Kaladin said. Teft stepped up beside him. He hadn\u2019t gotten a shave, though he\u2019d begun keeping his short, grey beard neatly trimmed.\r\n\u201CYeah,\u201D Gaz said, \u201Cbut I don\u2019t make assignments any more. Brightness Hashal wants to do it herself. In the name of her husband, of course.\u201D\r\nKaladin gritted his teeth. She\u2019d starve Bridge Four of members. \u201CSo we get nothing.\u201D\r\n\u201CI didn\u2019t say\r\nthat,\u201D Gaz said, then spat black spittle to the side. \u201CShe gave you one.\u201D\r\nThat\u2019s something, at least,Kaladin thought. There were a good hundred men in the new group. \u201CWhich one? He\u2019d better be tall enough to carry a bridge.\u201D\r\n\u201COh, he\u2019s tall enough,\u201D Gaz said, gesturing a few slaves out of the way. \u201CGood worker too.\u201D The men shuffled aside, revealing one man standing at the back. He was a little shorter than average, but he\r\nwasstill tall enough to carry a bridge.\r\nBut he had black and red marbled skin.\r\n\u201CA\r\nparshman?\u201D Kaladin asked. To his side, Teft cursed under his breath.\r\n\u201CWhy not?\u201D Gaz said. \u201CThey\u2019re perfect slaves. Never talk back.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut we\u2019re at\r\nwarwith them!\u201D Teft said.\r\n\u201CWe\u2019re at war with a tribe of oddities,\u201D Gaz said. \u201CThose out on the Shattered Plains are right different from the fellows who work for us.\u201D\r\nThat much, at least, was true. There were a lot of parshmen in the warcamp, and\u2014despite their skin markings\u2014there was little similarity between them and the Parshendi warriors. None had the strange growths of armorlike carapace on their skin, for instance. Kaladin eyed the sturdy, bald man. The parshman stared at the ground; he wore only a loincloth, and he had a\r\nthicknessabout him. His fingers were thicker than those of human men, his arms stouter, his thighs wider.\r\n\u201CHe\u2019s domesticated,\u201D Gaz said. \u201CYou don\u2019t need to worry.\u201D\r\n\u201CI thought parshmen were too valuable to use in bridge runs,\u201D Kaladin said.\r\n\u201CThis is just an experiment,\u201D Gaz said. \u201CBrightness Hashal wants to know her options. Finding enough bridgemen has been difficult lately, and parshmen could help fill in holes.\u201D\r\n\u201CThis is foolishness, Gaz,\u201D Teft said. \u201CI don\u2019t care if he\u2019s \u2018domesticated\u2019 or not. Asking him to carry a bridge against others of his kind is pure idiocy. What if he betrays us?\u201D\r\nGaz shrugged. \u201CWe\u2019ll see if that happens.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CLeave it, Teft,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CYou, parshman, come with me.\u201D He turned to walk back down the hill. The parshman dutifully followed. Teft cursed and did so as well.\r\n\u201CWhat trick are they trying on us, do you think?\u201D Teft asked.\r\n\u201CI suspect it\u2019s just what he said. A test to see if a parshman can be trusted to run bridges. Perhaps he\u2019ll do as he\u2019s told. Or perhaps he\u2019ll refuse to run, or will try to kill us. She wins regardless.\u201D\r\n\u201CKelek\u2019s breath,\u201D Teft cursed. \u201CDarker than a Horneater\u2019s stomach, our situation is. She\u2019ll see us dead, Kaladin.\u201D\r\n\u201CI know.\u201D He glanced over his shoulder at the parshman. He was a little taller than most, his face a little wider, but they all looked about the same to Kaladin.\r\nThe other members of Bridge Four had lined up by the time Kaladin returned. They watched the approaching parshman with surprise and disbelief. Kaladin stopped before them, Teft at his side, the parshman behind. It made him itch, to have one of them behind him. He casually stepped to the side. The parshman just stood there, eyes downward, shoulders slumped.\r\nKaladin glanced at the others. They had guessed, and they were growing hostile.\r\nStormfather,Kaladin thought.\r\nThereis\r\nsomething lower in this world than a bridgeman. A parshman bridgeman.Parshmen might cost more than most slaves, but so did a chull. In fact, the comparison was a good one, because parshmen were worked like animals.\r\nSeeing the reaction of the others made Kaladin pity the creature. And that made him mad at himself. Did he\r\nalwayshave to react this way? This parshman was dangerous, a distraction for the other men, a factor they couldn\u2019t depend on.\r\nA liability.\r\nTurn a liability into an advantage whenever you can..Those words had been spoken by a man who cared only for his own skin.\r\nStorm it,Kaladin thought.\r\nI\u2019m a fool. A downright, sodden idiot. This isn\u2019t the same. Not at all.\u201CParshman,\u201D he asked. \u201CDo you have a name?\u201D\r\nThe man shook his head. Parshmen rarely spoke. They could, but you had to prod them into it.\r\n\u201CWell, we\u2019ll have to call you something,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CHow about Shen?\u201D\r\nThe man shrugged.\r\n\u201CAll right then,\u201D Kaladin said to the others. \u201CThis is Shen. He\u2019s one of us now.\u201D\r\n\u201CA parshman?\u201D Lopen asked, lounging beside the barrack. \u201CI don\u2019t like him, gancho. Look how he stares at me.\u201D\r\n\u201CHe\u2019ll kill us while we sleep,\u201D Moash added.\r\n\u201CNo, this is\r\ngood,\u201D Skar said. \u201CWe can just have him run at the front. He\u2019ll take an arrow for one of us.\u201D\r\nSyl alighted on Kaladin\u2019s shoulder, looking down at the parshman. Her eyes were sorrowful.\r\nIf you were to overthrow the lighteyes and place yourselves in power, abuses would still happen. They\u2019d just happen to other people.\r\nBut this was a\r\nparshman.\r\nGotta do what you can to stay alive\u2026.\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CShen is one of\r\nusnow. I don\u2019t care what he was before. I don\u2019t care what any of you were. We\u2019re Bridge Four. So is he.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut\u2014\u201D Skar began.\r\n\u201C\r\nNo,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CWe not going to treat him like the lighteyes treat us, Skar. That\u2019s all there is to it. Rock, find him a vest and sandals.\u201D\r\nThe bridgemen split up, all save Teft. \u201CWhat about\u2026our plans?\u201D Teft asked quietly.\r\n\u201CWe proceed,\u201D Kaladin said.\r\nTeft looked uncomfortable about that.\r\n\u201CWhat\u2019s he going to do, Teft?\u201D Kaladin asked. \u201CTell on us? I\u2019ve never heard a parshman say more than a single word at a time. I doubt he could act as a spy.\u201D\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know,\u201D Teft grumbled. \u201CBut I\u2019ve never liked them. They seem to be able to talk to each other, without making any sounds. I don\u2019t like the way they look.\u201D\r\n\u201CTeft,\u201D Kaladin said flatly, \u201Cif we rejected bridgemen based on their looks, we\u2019d have kicked you out weeks ago for that face of yours.\u201D\r\nTeft grunted. Then he smiled.\r\n\u201CWhat?\u201D Kaladin asked.\r\n\u201CNothing,\u201D he said. \u201CJust\u2026for a moment, you reminded me of better days. Afore this storm came crashing down on me. You realize the odds, don\u2019t you? Fighting our way free, escaping a man like Sadeas?\u201D\r\nKaladin nodded solemnly.\r\n\u201CGood,\u201D Teft said. \u201CWell, since you aren\u2019t inclined to do it, I\u2019ll keep an eye on our friend \u2018Shen\u2019 over there. You can thank me after I stop him from sticking a knife in your back.\u201D\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t think we have to worry.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou\u2019re young,\u201D Teft said. \u201CI\u2019m old.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat makes you wiser, presumably?\u201D\r\n\u201CDamnation no,\u201D Teft said. \u201CThe only thing it proves is that I\u2019ve more experience staying alive than you. I\u2019ll watch him. You just train the rest of this sorry lot to\u2026\u201D He trailed off, looking around. \u201CTo keep from tripping over their own feet the moment someone threatens them. You understand?\u201D\r\nKaladin nodded. That sounded much like something one of Kaladin\u2019s old sergeants would say. Teft was insistent on not talking about his past, but he never\r\nhadseemed as beaten down as most of the others.\r\n\u201CAll right,\u201D Kaladin said, \u201Cmake sure the men take care of their equipment.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat will you be doing?\u201D\r\n\u201CWalking,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CAnd thinking.\u201D\r\nAn hour later, Kaladin still wandered Sadeas\u2019s warcamp. He\u2019d need to return to the lumberyard soon; his men were on chasm duty again, and had been given only a few free hours to care for equipment.\r\nAs a youth, he hadn\u2019t understood why his father had often gone walking to think. The older Kaladin grew, the more he found himself imitating his father\u2019s habits. Walking, moving, it did something to his mind. The constant passing of tents, colors cycling, men bustling\u2014it created a sense of change, and it made his thoughts want to move as well.\r\nDon\u2019t hedge bets with your life, Kaladin,Durk had always said.\r\nDon\u2019t put in a chip when you have a pocket full of marks. Bet them all or leave the table.\r\nSyl danced before him, jumping from shoulder to shoulder in the crowded street. Occasionally she\u2019d land on the head of someone passing in the other direction and sit there, legs crossed, as she passed Kaladin. All his spheres were on the table. He was determined to help the bridgemen. But something itched at him, a worry that he couldn\u2019t yet explain.\r\n\u201CYou seem troubled,\u201D Syl said, landing on his shoulder. She wore a cap and jacket over her usual dress, as if imitating nearby shopkeepers. They passed the apothecary\u2019s shop. Kaladin barely bothered to glance at it. He had no knobweed sap to sell. He\u2019d run out of supplies soon.\r\nHe\u2019d told his men that he\u2019d train them to fight, but that would take time. And once they were trained, how would they get spears out of the chasms to use in the escape? Sneaking them out would be tough, considering how they were searched. They could just start fighting at the search itself, but that would only put the entire warcamp on alert.\r\nProblems, problems. The more he thought, the more impossible his task seemed.\r\nHe made way for a couple of soldiers in forest-green coats. Their brown eyes marked them as common citizens, but the white knots on their shoulders meant they were citizen officers. Squadleaders and sergeants.\r\n\u201CKaladin?\u201D Syl asked.\r\n\u201CGetting the bridgemen out is as large a task as I\u2019ve ever faced. Much more difficult than my other escape attempts as a slave, and I failed at each of those. I can\u2019t help wondering if I\u2019m setting myself up for another disaster.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt will be different this time, Kaladin,\u201D Syl said. \u201CI can feel it.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat sounds like something Tien would have said. His death proves that words don\u2019t change anything, Syl. Before you ask, I\u2019m not sinking into despair again. But I\r\ncan\u2019tignore what has happened to me. It started with Tien. Since that moment, it seems that every time I\u2019ve specifically picked people to protect, they\u2019ve ended up dead. Every time. It\u2019s enough to make me wonder if the Almighty himself hates me.\u201D\r\nShe frowned. \u201CI think you\u2019re being foolish. Besides, if anything, he\u2019d hate the people who died, not you.\r\nYoulived.\u201D\r\n\u201CI suppose it\u2019s self-centered to make it all about me. But, Syl, I survive, every time, when almost nobody else does. Over and over again. My old spearman\u2019s squad, the first bridge crew I ran with, numerous slaves I tried to help escape. There\u2019s a pattern. It\u2019s getting harder and harder to ignore.\u201D\r\n\u201CMaybe the Almighty is preserving you,\u201D Syl said.\u201D\r\nKaladin hesitated on the street; a passing soldier cursed and shoved him aside. Something about this whole conversation was wrong. Kaladin moved over beside a rain barrel set between two sturdy stone-walled shops.\r\n\u201CSyl,\u201D he said. \u201CYou mentioned the Almighty.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou did first.\u201D\r\n\u201CIgnore that for now. Do you believe in the Almighty? Do you know if he really exists?\u201D\r\nSyl cocked her head. \u201CI don\u2019t know. Huh. Well, there are a lot of things I don\u2019t know. But I should know this one. I think. Maybe?\u201D She seemed very perplexed.\r\n\u201CI\u2019m not sure if I believe,\u201D Kaladin said, looking out at the street. \u201CMy mother did, and my father always spoke of the Heralds with reverence. I think he believed too, but maybe just because of the traditions of healing that are said to have come from the Heralds. The ardents ignore us bridgemen. They used to visit the soldiers, when I was in Amaram\u2019s army, but I\u00A0 haven\u2019t seen a single one in the lumberyard. I haven\u2019t given it much thought. Believing never seemed to help any of the soldiers.\u201D\r\n\u201CSo if you don\u2019t believe, then there\u2019s no reason to think that the Almighty hates you.\u201D\r\n\u201CExcept,\u201D Kaladin said, \u201Cif there\r\nisno Almighty, there might be something else. I don\u2019t know. A lot of the soldiers I knew were superstitious. They\u2019d talk about things like the Old Magic and the Nightwatcher, things that could bring a man bad luck. I scoffed at them. But how long can I continue to ignore that possibility? What if all of these failures can be traced to something like that?\u201D\r\nSyl looked disturbed. The cap and jacket she\u2019d been wearing dissolved to mist, and she wrapped her arms around herself as if chilled by his comments.\r\nOdium reigns\u2026.\r\n\u201CSyl,\u201D he said, frowning, thinking back to his strange dream. \u201CHave you ever heard of something called Odium? I don\u2019t mean the feeling, I mean\u2026a person, or something called by that name.\u201D\r\nSyl suddenly hissed. It was a feral, disturbing sound. She zipped off his shoulder, becoming a darting streak of light, and shot up underneath the eaves of the next building.\r\nHe blinked. \u201CSyl?\u201D he called, drawing the attention of a couple of passing washwomen. The spren did not reappear. Kaladin folded his arms. That word had set her off. Why?\r\nA loud series of curses interrupted his thoughts. Kaladin spun as a man burst out of a handsome stone building across the street and shoved a half-naked woman out in front of him. The man had bright blue eyes, and his coat\u2014carried over one arm\u2014had red knots on the shoulder. A lighteyed officer, not very high-ranking. Perhaps seventh dahn.\r\nThe half-dressed woman fell to the ground. She held the loose front of the dress to her chest, crying, her long black hair down and tied with two red ribbons. The dress was that of a lighteyed woman, except that both sleeves were short, safehand exposed. A courtesan.\r\nThe officer continued to curse as he pulled on his coat. He didn\u2019t do up the buttons. Instead, he stepped forward and kicked the whore in the belly. She gasped, painspren pulling from the ground and gathering around her. Nobody on the street paused, though most did hurry on their way, heads down.\r\nKaladin growled, jumping into the roadway, pushing his way past a group of soldiers. Then he stopped. Three men in blue stepped out of the crowd, moving purposefully between the fallen woman and the officer in red. Only one was lighteyed, judging by the knots on his shoulders. Golden knots. A high-ranking man indeed, second or third dahn. These obviously weren\u2019t from Sadeas\u2019s army, not with those well-pressed blue coats.\r\nSadeas\u2019s officer hesitated. The officer in blue rested his hand on the hilt of his sword. The other two were holding fine halberds with gleaming half-moon heads.\r\nA group of soldiers in red moved out of the crowd and began to surround those in blue. The air grew tense, and Kaladin realized that the street\u2014bustling just moments ago\u2014was quickly emptying. He stood practically alone, the only one watching the three men in blue, now surrounded by seven in red. The woman was still on the ground, sniffling. She huddled next to the blue garbed officer.\r\nThe man who had kicked her\u2014a thick-browed brute with a mop of uncombed black hair\u2014began to button up the right side of his coat. \u201CYou don\u2019t belong here, friends. It seems you wandered into the wrong warcamp.\u201D\r\n\u201CWe have legitimate business,\u201D said the officer in blue. He had light golden hair, speckled with Alethi black, and a handsome face. He held his hand before him as if wishing to shake hands with Sadeas\u2019s officer. \u201CCome now,\u201D he said affably. \u201CWhatever your problem with this woman, I\u2019m sure it can be resolved without anger or violence.\u201D\r\nKaladin moved back under the overhang where Syl had hidden.\r\n\u201CShe\u2019s a whore,\u201D Sadeas\u2019s man said.\r\n\u201CI can see that,\u201D replied the man in blue. He kept his hand out.\r\nThe officer in red spat on it.\r\n\u201CI see,\u201D said the blond man. He pulled his hand back, and twisting lines of mist gathered in the air, coalescing in his hands as he raised them to an offensive posture. A massive sword appeared, as long as a man is tall.\r\nIt dripped with water that condensed along its cold, glimmering length. It was beautiful, long and sinuous, its single edge rippled like an eel and curved up into a point. The back bore delicate ridges, like crystal formations.\r\nSadeas\u2019s officer stumbled away and fell, his face pale. The soldiers in red scattered. The officer cursed at them\u2014as vile a curse as Kaladin had ever heard\u2014but none returned to help him. With a final glare, he scrambled up the steps back into the building.\r\nThe door slammed, leaving the roadway eerily silent. Kaladin was the only one on the street besides the soldiers in blue and the fallen courtesan. The Shardbearer gave Kaladin a glance, but obviously judged him no threat. He thrust his sword into the stones; the blade sank in easily and stood with its hilt toward the sky.\r\nThe young Shardbearer then gave his hand to the fallen whore. \u201CWhat did you do to him, out of curiosity?\u201D\r\nHesitantly, she took his hand and let him pull her to her feet. \u201CHe refused to pay, claiming his reputation made it a pleasure for me.\u201D She grimaced. \u201CHe kicked me the first time after I made a comment about his \u2018reputation.\u2019 It apparently wasn\u2019t what he thought he was known for.\u201D\r\nThe brightlord chuckled. \u201CI suggest you insist on being paid\r\nfirstfrom now on. We\u2019ll escort you to the border. I advise against returning to Sadeas\u2019s warcamp anytime soon.\u201D\r\nThe woman nodded, holding the front of her dress to her chest. Her safehand was still exposed. Sleek, with tan skin, the fingers long and delicate. Kaladin found himself staring at it and blushing. She sidled up to the brightlord while his two comrades watched the sides of the streets, halberds ready. Even with her hair disheveled and her makeup smudged, she was quite pretty. \u201CThank you, Brightlord. Perhaps I could interest you? There would be no charge.\u201D\r\nThe young brightlord raised an eyebrow. \u201CTempting,\u201D he said, \u201Cbut my father would kill me. He has this thing about the old ways.\u201D\r\n\u201CA pity,\u201D she said, pulling away from him, awkwardly covering her chest as she slipped her arm into its sleeve. She took out a glove for her safehand. \u201CYour father is quite prudish, then?\u201D\r\n\u201CYou might say that.\u201D He turned toward Kaladin. \u201CHo, bridgeboy.\u201D\r\nBridgeboy?This lordling looked to be just a few years older than Kaladin himself.\r\n\u201CRun and give word to Brightlord Reral Makoram,\u201D the Shardbearer said, flipping something across the street toward Kaladin. A sphere. It sparkled in the sunlight before Kaladin caught it. \u201CHe\u2019s in the Sixth Battalion. Tell him that Adolin Kholin won\u2019t make today\u2019s meeting. I\u2019ll send word to reschedule another time.\u201D\r\nKaladin looked down at the sphere. An emerald chip. More than he normally earned in two weeks. He looked up; the young brightlord and his two men were already retreating, the whore following.\r\n\u201CYou rushed to help her,\u201D a voice said. He looked up as Syl floated down to rest on his shoulder. \u201CThat was very noble of you.\u201D\r\n\u201CThose others got there first,\u201D Kaladin said.\r\nAnd one of them a lighteyes, no less. What was in it for him?\r\n\u201CYou still tried to help.\u201D\r\n\u201CFoolishly,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CWhat would I have done? Fought down a lighteyes? That would have drawn half the camp\u2019s soldiers down on me, and the whore would just have been beaten more for causing such a fracas. She could have ended up dead for my efforts.\u201D He fell silent. That sounded too much like what he\u2019d been saying before.\r\nHe couldn\u2019t give in to assuming he was cursed, or had bad luck, or whatever it was. Superstition never got a man anywhere. But he had to admit, the pattern\r\nwasdisturbing. If he acted as he always had before, how could he expect different results? He had to try something new. Change, somehow. This was going to take more thought.\r\nKaladin began walking back toward the lumberyard.\r\n\u201CAren\u2019t you going to do what the brightlord asked?\u201D Syl said. She didn\u2019t show any lingering effects of her sudden fright; it was as if she wanted to pretend it hadn\u2019t happened.\r\n\u201CAfter how he treated me?\u201D Kaladin snapped.\r\n\u201CIt wasn\u2019t that bad.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m not going to bow to them,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CI\u2019m done running at their whims just because they\r\nexpectme to do so. If he was so worried about this message, then he should have waited to make certain I was willing.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou took his sphere.\u201D\r\n\u201CEarned by the sweat of the darkeyes he exploits.\u201D\r\nSyl fell silent for a moment. \u201CThis darkness about you when you talk of them frightens me, Kaladin. You stop being yourself when you think about lighteyes.\u201D\r\nHe didn\u2019t respond, just continuing on his way. He owed that brightlord nothing, and besides, he had orders to be back in the lumberyard.\r\nBut the man\r\nhadstepped up to protect the woman.\r\nNo,Kaladin told himself forcefully.\r\nHe was just looking for a way to embarrass one of Sadeas\u2019s officers. Everyone knows there\u2019s tension between the camps.\r\nAnd that was all he let himself think on the subject."

      "ChapterName": "47: STORMBLESSINGS",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\nONE YEAR AGO\r\nKaladin turned the rock over in his fingers, letting the facets of suspended quartz catch the light. He leaned against a large boulder, one foot pressed back against the stone, his spear next to him.\r\nThe rock caught the light, spinning it in different colors, depending on the direction he turned it. Beautiful, miniature crystals shimmered, like the cities made of gemstones mentioned in lore.\r\nAround him, Highmarshal Amaram\u2019s army prepared for battle. Six thousand men sharpened spears or strapped on leather armor. The battlefield was nearby, and, with no highstorms expected, the army had spent the night in tents.\r\nIt had been nearly four years since he\u2019d joined Amaram\u2019s army on that rainy night. Four years. And an eternity.\r\nSoldiers hurried this way and that. Some raised hands and called greetings to Kaladin. He nodded to them, pocketing the stone, then folded his arms to wait. In the near distance, Amaram\u2019s standard was already flying, a burgundy field blazoned with a dark green glyphpair shaped like a whitespine with tusks upraised.\r\nMeremand\r\nkhakh, honor and determination. The banner fluttered before a rising sun, the morning\u2019s chill starting to give way to the heat of the day.\r\nKaladin turned, looking eastward. Toward a home to which he could never return. He\u2019d decided months ago. His enlistment would be up in a few weeks, but he would sign on again. He couldn\u2019t face his parents after having broken his promise to protect Tien.\r\nA heavyset darkeyed soldier trotted up to him, an axe strapped to his back, white knots on his shoulders. The nonstandard weapon was a privilege of being a squadleader. Gare had beefy forearms and a thick black beard, though he\u2019d lost a large section of scalp on the right side of his head. He was followed by two of his sergeants\u2014Nalem and Korabet.\r\n\u201CKaladin,\u201D Gare said. \u201CStormfather, man! Why are you pestering me? On a battle day!\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m well aware of what\u2019s ahead, Gare,\u201D Kaladin said, arms still folded. Several companies were already gathering, forming ranks. Dallet would see Kaladin\u2019s own squad into place. At the front, they\u2019d decided. Their enemy\u2014a lighteyes named Hallaw\u2014was fond of long volleys. They\u2019d fought his men several times before. One time in particular was burned into Kaladin\u2019s memory and soul.\r\nHe had joined Amaram\u2019s army expecting to defend the Alethi borders\u2014and defend them he did. Against other Alethi. Lesser landlords who sought to slice off bits of Highprince Sadeas\u2019s lands. Occasionally, Amaram\u2019s armies would try to seize territory from other highprinces\u2014lands Amaram claimed really belonged to Sadeas and had been stolen years before. Kaladin didn\u2019t know what to make of that. Of all lighteyes, Amaram was the only one he trusted. But it did seem like they were doing the same thing as the armies they fought.\r\n\u201CKaladin?\u201D Gare asked impatiently.\r\n\u201CYou have something I want,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CNew recruit, just joined yesterday. Galan says his name is Cenn.\u201D\r\nGare scowled. \u201CI\u2019m supposed to play this game with you\r\nnow? Talk to me after the battle. If the boy survives, maybe I\u2019ll give him to you.\u201D He turned to leave, cronies following.\r\nKaladin stood up straight, picking up his spear. The motion stopped Gare in his tracks.\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s not going to be a trouble to you,\u201D Kaladin said quietly. \u201CJust send the boy to my squad. Accept your payment. Stay quiet.\u201D He pulled out a pouch of spheres.\r\n\u201CMaybe I don\u2019t want to sell him,\u201D Gare said, turning back.\r\n\u201CYou\u2019re not selling him. You\u2019re transferring him to me.\u201D\r\nGare eyed the pouch. \u201CWell then, maybe I don\u2019t like how everyone does what\r\nyoutell them. I don\u2019t care how good you are with a spear. My squad is my own.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m not going to give you any more, Gare,\u201D Kaladin said, dropping the pouch to the ground. The spheres clinked. \u201CWe both know the boy is useless to you. Untrained, ill-equipped, too small to make a good line soldier. Send him to me.\u201D\r\nKaladin turned and began to walk away. Within seconds, he heard a clink as Gare recovered the pouch. \u201CCan\u2019t blame a man for trying.\u201D\r\nKaladin kept walking.\r\n\u201CWhat do these recruits mean to you, anyway?\u201D Gare called after Kaladin. \u201CYour squad is half made up of men too small to fight properly! Almost makes a man think you\r\nwantto get killed!\u201D\r\nKaladin ignored him. He passed through the camp, waving to those who waved at him. Most everyone kept out of his way, either because they knew and respected him or they\u2019d heard of his reputation. Youngest squadleader in the army, only four years of experience and already in command. A darkeyed man had to travel to the Shattered Plains to go any higher in rank.\r\nThe camp was a bedlam of soldiers hurrying about in last-minute preparations. More and more companies were gathering at the line, and Kaladin could see the enemy lining up on the shallow ridge across the field to the west.\r\nThe enemy. That was what they were called. Yet whenever there was an\r\nactualborder dispute with the Vedens or the Reshi, those men would line up beside Amaram\u2019s troops and they would fight together. It was as if the Nightwatcher toyed with them, playing some forbidden game of chance, occasionally setting the men on his gameboard as allies, then setting them to kill one another the next day.\r\nThat wasn\u2019t for spearmen to think about. So he\u2019d been told. Repeatedly. He supposed he should listen, as he figured that his duty was to keep his squad alive as best he could. Winning was secondary to that.\r\nYou can\u2019t kill to protect\u2026.\r\nHe found the surgeon\u2019s station easily; he could smell the scents of antiseptics and of small fires burning. Those smells reminded him of his youth, which now seemed so far, far away. Had he ever really planned to go become a surgeon? What had happened to his parents? What of Roshone?\r\nMeaningless, now. He\u2019d sent word to them via Amaram\u2019s scribes, a terse note that had cost him a week\u2019s wages. They knew he\u2019d failed, and they knew he didn\u2019t intend to return. There had been no reply.\r\nVen was the chief of the surgeons, a tall man with a bulbous nose and a long face. He stood watching as his apprentices folded bandages. Kaladin had once idly considered getting wounded so he could join them; all of the apprentices had some incapacitation that prevented them from fighting. Kaladin hadn\u2019t been able to do it. Wounding himself seemed cowardly. Besides, surgery was his old life. In a way, he didn\u2019t deserve it anymore.\r\nKaladin pulled a pouch of spheres from his belt, meaning to toss it to Ven. The pouch stuck, however, refusing to come free of the belt. Kaladin cursed, stumbling, tugging at the pouch. It came free suddenly, causing him to lose his balance again. A translucent white form zipped away, spinning with a carefree air.\r\n\u201CStorming windspren,\u201D he said. They were common out on these rocky plains.\r\nHe continued past the surgery pavilion, tossing the pouch of spheres to Ven. The tall man caught it deftly, making it vanish into a pocket of his voluminous white robe. The bribe would ensure that Kaladin\u2019s men were served first on the battlefield, assuming there were no lighteyes who needed the attention.\r\nIt was time to join the line. He sped up, jogging along, spear in hand. Nobody gave him grief for wearing trousers under his leather spearman\u2019s skirt\u2014something he did so his men could recognize him from behind. In fact, nobody gave him grief about much of anything these days. That still felt odd, after so many struggles during his first years in the army.\r\nHe still didn\u2019t feel as if he belonged. His reputation set him apart, but what was he to do? It kept his men from being taunted, and after several years of dealing with disaster after disaster, he could finally pause and\r\nthink.\r\nHe wasn\u2019t certain he liked that. Thinking had proven dangerous lately. It had been a long while since he\u2019d taken out that rock and thought of Tien and home.\r\nHe made his way to the front ranks, spotting his men right where he\u2019d told them to go. \u201CDallet,\u201D Kaladin called, as he trotted over to the mountainous spearman who was the squad\u2019s sergeant. \u201CWe\u2019re soon going to have a new recruit. I need you to\u2026\u201D He trailed off. A young man, maybe fourteen, stood beside Dallet, looking tiny in his spearman\u2019s armor.\r\nKaladin felt a flash of recall. Another lad, one with a familiar face, holding a spear he wasn\u2019t supposed to need. Two promises broken at once.\r\n\u201CHe found his way here just a few minutes ago, sir,\u201D Dallet said. \u201CI\u2019ve been gettin\u2019 him ready.\u201D\r\nKaladin shook himself out of the moment. Tien was dead. But\r\nStormfather, this new lad looked a lot like him.\r\n\u201CWell done,\u201D Kaladin said to Dallet, forcing himself to look away from Cenn. \u201CI paid good money to get that boy away from Gare. That man\u2019s so incompetent he might as well be fighting for the other side.\u201D\r\nDallet grunted in agreement. The men would know what to do with Cenn.\r\nAll right,Kaladin thought, scanning the battlefield for a good place for his men to stand their ground,\r\nlet\u2019s get to it.\r\nHe\u2019d heard stories about the soldiers who fought on the Shattered Plains. The\r\nrealsoldiers. If you showed enough promise fighting in these border disputes, you were sent there. It was supposed to be safer there\u2014far more soldiers, but fewer battles. So Kaladin wanted to get his squad there as soon as possible.\r\nHe conferred with Dallet, picking a place to hold. Eventually, the horns blew.\r\nKaladin\u2019s squad charged.\r\n\u201CWhere\u2019s the boy?\u201D Kaladin said, yanking his spear out of the chest of a man in brown. The enemy soldier fell to the ground, groaning. \u201CDallet!\u201D\r\nThe burly sergeant was fighting. He couldn\u2019t turn to acknowledge the yell.\r\nKaladin cursed, scanning the chaotic battlefield. Spears hit shields, flesh, leather; men yelled and screamed. Painspren swarmed the ground, like small orange hands or bits of sinew, reaching up from the ground amid the blood of the fallen.\r\nKaladin\u2019s squad was all accounted for, their wounded protected at the center. All except the new boy. Tien.\r\nC\r\nenn,Kaladin thought.\r\nHis name is Cenn.\r\nKaladin caught sight of a flash of green in the middle of the enemy brown. A terrified voice somehow cut through the commotion. It was him.\r\nKaladin threw himself out of formation, prompting a call of surprise from Larn, who had been fighting at his side. Kaladin ducked past a spear thrust by an enemy, dashing over the stony ground, hopping corpses.\r\nCenn had been knocked to the ground, spear raised. An enemy soldier slammed his weapon down.\r\nNo.\r\nKaladin blocked the blow, deflecting the enemy spear and skidding to a\u00A0stop in front of Cenn. There were six spearmen here, all wearing brown. Kaladin spun among them in a wild offensive rush. His spear seemed to flow of its own accord. He swept the feet out from under one man, took down another with a thrown knife.\r\nHe was like water running down a hill, flowing, always moving. Spearheads flashed in the air around him, hafts hissing with speed. Not one hit him. He could not be stopped, not when he felt like this. When he had the energy of defending the fallen, the power of standing to protect one of his men.\r\nKaladin snapped his spear into a resting position, crouching with one foot forward, one behind, spear held under his arm. Sweat trickled from his brow, cooled by the breeze. Odd. There hadn\u2019t been a breeze before. Now it seemed to envelop him.\r\nAll six enemy spearmen were dead or incapacitated. Kaladin breathed in and out once, then turned to see to Cenn\u2019s wound. He dropped his spear beside him, kneeling. The cut wasn\u2019t that bad, though it probably pained the lad terribly.\r\nGetting out a bandage, Kaladin gave the battlefield one quick glance. Nearby, an enemy soldier stirred, but he was wounded badly enough that he wouldn\u2019t be trouble. Dallet and the rest of Kaladin\u2019s team were clearing the area of enemy stragglers. In the near distance, an enemy lighteyes of high rank was rallying a small group of soldiers for a counterattack. He wore full plate. Not Shardplate, of course, but silvery steel. A rich man, judging from his horse.\r\nIn a heartbeat, Kaladin was back to binding Cenn\u2019s leg\u2014though he kept watch on the wounded enemy soldier from the corner of his eye.\r\n\u201CKaladin, sir!\u201D Cenn exclaimed, pointing at the soldier who had stirred. Stormfather! Had the boy only just noticed the man? Had Kaladin\u2019s battle senses ever been as dull as this boy\u2019s?\r\nDallet pushed the wounded enemy away. The rest of the squad made a ring formation around Kaladin, Dallet, and Cenn. Kaladin finished his binding, then stood, picking up his spear.\r\nDallet handed him back his knives. \u201CHad me worried there, sir. Running off like that.\u201D\r\n\u201CI knew you\u2019d follow,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CRaise the red banner. Cyn, Korater, you\u2019re going back with the boy. Dallet, hold here. Amaram\u2019s line is bulging this direction. We should be safe soon.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd you, sir?\u201D Dallet asked.\r\nIn the near distance, the lighteyes had failed to rally enough troops. He was exposed, like a stone left behind by a stream running dry.\r\n\u201CA Shardbearer,\u201D Cenn said.\r\nDallet snorted. \u201CNo, thank the Stormfather. Just a lighteyed officer. Shardbearers are far too valuable to waste on a minor border dispute.\u201D\r\nKaladin clenched his jaw, watching that lighteyed warrior. How mighty the man thought himself, sitting on his expensive horse, kept safe from the spearmen by his majestic armor and tall mount. He swung his mace, killing those around him.\r\nThese skirmishes were caused by ones like him, greedy minor lighteyes who tried to steal land while the better men were away, fighting the Parshendi. His type had far, far fewer casualties than the spearmen, and so the lives under his command became cheap things.\r\nMore and more over the last few years, each and every one of these petty lighteyes had come to represent Roshone in Kaladin\u2019s eyes. Only Amaram himself stood apart. Amaram, who had treated Kaladin\u2019s father so well, promising to keep Tien safe. Amaram, who always spoke with respect, even to lowly spearmen. He was like Dalinar and Sadeas. Not this riffraff.\r\nOf course, Amaram had failed to protect Tien. But so had Kaladin.\r\n\u201CSir?\u201D Dallet said hesitantly.\r\n\u201CSubsquads Two and Three, pincer pattern,\u201D Kaladin said coldly, pointing at the enemy lighteyes. \u201CWe\u2019re taking a brightlord off his throne.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou sure that\u2019s wise, sir?\u201D Dallet said. \u201CWe\u2019ve got wounded.\u201D\r\nKaladin turned toward Dallet. \u201CThat\u2019s one of Hallaw\u2019s officers. He might be the one.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou don\u2019t know that, sir.\u201D\r\n\u201CRegardless, he\u2019s a battalionlord. If we kill an officer that high, we\u2019re all but guaranteed to be in the next group sent to the Shattered Plains. We\u2019re taking him. Imagine it, Dallet. Real soldiers. A warcamp with discipline and lighteyes with integrity. A place where our fighting will\r\nmeansomething.\u201D\r\nDallet sighed, but nodded. At Kaladin\u2019s wave, two subsquads joined him, as eager as he. Did they hate these squabbling lighteyes of their own accord, or had they picked up Kaladin\u2019s loathing?\r\nThe brightlord was surprisingly easy to take down. The problem with them\u2014almost to a man\u2014was that they underestimated darkeyes. Perhaps this one had a right. How many had he killed, in his years?\r\nSubsquad three drew off the honor guard. Subsquad two distracted the\u00A0lighteyes. He didn\u2019t see Kaladin approaching from a third direction. The man dropped with a knife to the eye; his face was unprotected. He screamed as he clattered to the ground, still alive. Kaladin rammed his spear down into the fallen man\u2019s face, striking three times as the horse galloped off.\r\nThe man\u2019s honor guard panicked and fled to rejoin their army. Kaladin signaled to the two subsquads by banging his spear against his shield, giving the \u201Chold position\u201D sign. They fanned out, and short Toorim\u2014a man Kaladin had rescued from another squad\u2014made as if to confirm the light-eyes was dead. He was really covertly looking for spheres.\r\nStealing from the dead was strictly prohibited, but Kaladin figured that if Amaram wanted the spoils, he could storming well kill the enemy himself. Kaladin respected Amaram more than most\u2014well, more than\r\nany\u2014lighteyes. But bribes weren\u2019t cheap.\r\nToorim walked up to him. \u201CNothing sir. Either he didn\u2019t bring any spheres into battle, or he has them hidden somewhere under that breastplate.\u201D\r\nKaladin nodded curtly, surveying the battlefield. Amaram\u2019s forces were recovering; they\u2019d win the day before long. In fact, Amaram would probably be leading a direct surge against the enemy by now. He generally entered the battle at the end.\r\nKaladin wiped his brow. He\u2019d have to send for Norby, their captainlord, to prove their kill. First he needed those healers to\u2014\r\n\u201CSir!\u201D Toorim said suddenly.\r\nKaladin glanced back at the enemy lines.\r\n\u201CStormfather!\u201D Toorim exclaimed. \u201C\r\nSir!\u201D\r\nToorim wasn\u2019t looking at the enemy lines. Kaladin spun, looking back at friendly ranks. There\u2014bearing down through the soldiers on a horse the color of death itself\u2014was an impossibility.\r\nThe man wore shining golden armor.\r\nPerfectgolden armor, as if this were what every other suit of armor had been designed to imitate. Each piece fit perfectly; there were no holes showing straps or leather. It made the rider look enormous, powerful. Like a god carrying a majestic blade that should have been too big to use. It was engraved and stylized, shaped like flames in motion.\r\n\u201CStormfather\u2026\u201D Kaladin breathed.\r\nThe Shardbearer broke out of Amaram\u2019s lines. He\u2019d been riding through them, cutting down men as he passed. For a brief moment, Kaladin\u2019s mind refused to acknowledge that this creature\u2014this beautiful\r\ndivinity\u2014could be an enemy. The fact that the Shardbearer had come through their side reinforced that illusion.\r\nKaladin\u2019s confusion lasted right up until the moment the Shardbearer trampled Cenn, Shardblade dropping and cutting through Dallet\u2019s head in a single, easy stroke.\r\n\u201CNo!\u201D Kaladin bellowed. \u201C\r\nNo!\u201D\r\nDallet\u2019s body fell back to the ground, eyes seeming to catch alight, smoke rising from them. The Shardbearer cut down Cyn and trampled Lyndel before moving on. It was all done with nonchalance, like a woman pausing to wipe a spot on the counter.\r\n\u201C\r\nNO!\u201D Kaladin screamed, charging toward the fallen men of his squad. He hadn\u2019t lost anyone this battle! He was going to protect them all!\r\nHe fell to his knees beside Dallet, dropping his spear. But there was no heartbeat, and those burned-out eyes\u2026He was dead. Grief threatened to overwhelm Kaladin.\r\nNo!said the part of his mind trained by his father.\r\nSave the ones you can!\r\nHe turned to Cenn. The boy had taken a hoof to the chest, cracking his sternum and shattering ribs. The boy gasped, eyes upward, struggling for breath. Kaladin pulled out a bandage. Then he paused, looking at it. A bandage? To mend a smashed chest?\r\nCenn stopped wheezing. He convulsed once, eyes still open. \u201CHe watches!\u201D the boy hissed. \u201CThe black piper in the night. He holds us in his palm\u2026playing a tune that no man can hear!\u201D\r\nCenn\u2019s eyes glazed over. He stopped breathing.\r\nLyndel\u2019s face had been smashed in. Cyn\u2019s eyes smoldered, and he wasn\u2019t breathing either. Kaladin knelt in Cenn\u2019s blood, horrified, as Toorim and the two subsquads formed around him, looking as stunned as Kaladin felt.\r\nThis isn\u2019t possible. I\u2026I\u2026\r\nScreaming.\r\nKaladin looked up. Amaram\u2019s banner of green and burgundy flew just to the south. The Shardbearer had cut through Kaladin\u2019s squad heading straight for that banner. Spearmen fled in disarray, screaming, scattering before the Shardbearer.\r\nAnger boiled inside of Kaladin.\r\n\u201CSir?\u201D Toorim asked.\r\nKaladin picked up his spear and stood. His knees were covered with Cenn\u2019s blood. His men regarded him, confused, worried. They stood firm in the midst of the chaos; as far as Kaladin could tell, they were the only men who weren\u2019t fleeing. The Shardbearer had turned the ranks to mush.\r\nKaladin thrust his spear into the air, then began to run. His men bellowed a war cry, falling into formation behind him, charging across the flat rocky ground. Spearmen in uniforms of both colors scrambled out of the way, dropping spears and shields.\r\nKaladin picked up speed, legs pumping, his squad barely keeping pace. Just ahead\u2014right before the Shardbearer\u2014a pocket of green broke and ran. Amaram\u2019s honor guard. Faced by a Shardbearer, they abandoned their charge. Amaram himself was a solitary man on a rearing horse. He wore silvery plate armor that looked so\r\ncommonplacewhen compared with the Shardplate.\r\nKaladin\u2019s squad charged against the flow of the army, a wedge of soldiers going the wrong way. The\r\nonlyones going the wrong way. Some of the fleeing men paused as he charged past, but none joined.\r\nAhead, the Shardbearer rode past Amaram. With a sweep of the Blade, the Shardbearer slashed through the neck of Amaram\u2019s mount. Its eyes burned into two great pits, and it toppled, jerking fitfully, Amaram still in its saddle.\r\nThe Shardbearer wheeled his destrier in a tight circle, then threw himself from horseback at full speed. He hit the ground with a grinding sound, somehow remaining upright and skidding to a halt.\r\nKaladin redoubled his speed. Was he running to get vengeance, or was he trying to protect his highmarshal? The only lighteyes who had ever shown a modicum of humanity? Did it matter?\r\nAmaram struggled in his bulky plate, the carcass of the horse on his leg.\r\nThe Shardbearer raised his Blade in two hands to finish him off.\r\nComing at the Shardbearer from behind, Kaladin screamed and swung low with the butt of his spear, putting momentum and muscle behind the blow. The spear haft shattered against the Shardbearer\u2019s back leg in a spray of wooden slivers.\r\nThe jolt of it knocked Kaladin to the ground, his arms shaking, the broken spear clutched in his hands. The Shardbearer stumbled, lowering his Blade. He turned a helmed face toward Kaladin, posture indicating utter surprise.\r\nThe twenty remaining men of Kaladin\u2019s squad arrived a heartbeat later, attacking vigorously. Kaladin scrambled to his feet and ran for the spear from a fallen soldier. He tossed his broken one away after snatching one of his knives from its sheath, snatched the new one off the ground, then turned back to see his men attacking as he had taught. They came at the foe from three directions, ramming spears between joints in the Plate. The Shardbearer glanced around, as a bemused man might regard a pack of puppies yapping around him. Not a single one of the spear thrusts appeared to pierce his armor. He shook a helmed head.\r\nThen he struck.\r\nThe Shardblade swept out in a broad sweeping series of deadly strokes, cutting through ten of the spearmen.\r\nKaladin was paralyzed in horror as Toorim, Acis, Hamel, and seven others fell to the ground, eyes burning, their armor and weapons sheared completely through. The remaining spearmen stumbled back, aghast.\r\nThe Shardbearer attacked again, killing Raksha, Navar, and four others. Kaladin gaped. His men\u2014his friends\u2014dead, just like that. The last four scrambled away, Hab stumbling over Toorim\u2019s corpse and falling to the ground, dropping his spear.\r\nThe Shardbearer ignored them, stepping up to the pinned Amaram again.\r\nNo,Kaladin thought.\r\nNo, no, NO!Something drove him forward, against all logic, against all sense. Sickened, agonized,\r\nenraged.\r\nThe hollow where they fought was empty save for them. Sensible spearmen had fled. His four remaining men achieved the ridge a short distance away, but didn\u2019t run. They called for him.\r\n\u201CKaladin!\u201D Reesh yelled. \u201CKaladin, no!\u201D\r\nKaladin screamed instead. The Shardbearer saw him, and spun\u2014impossibly quick\u2014swinging. Kaladin ducked under the blow and rammed the butt of his spear against the Shardbearer\u2019s knee.\r\nIt bounced off. Kaladin cursed, throwing himself backward just as the Blade sliced the air in front of him. Kaladin rebounded and lunged forward. He made an expert thrust at his enemy\u2019s neck. The neck brace rebuffed the attack. Kaladin\u2019s spear barely scratched the Plate\u2019s paint.\r\nThe Shardbearer turned on him, holding his Blade in a two-handed grip. Kaladin dashed past, just out of range of that incredible sword. Amaram had finally pulled himself free, and he was crawling away, one leg dragging behind him\u2014multiple fractures, from the twist of it.\r\nKaladin skidded to a stop, spinning, regarding the Shardbearer. This creature wasn\u2019t a god. It was everything the most petty of lighteyes represented. The ability to kill people like Kaladin with impunity.\r\nEvery suit of armor had a chink. Every man had a flaw. Kaladin thought he saw the man\u2019s eyes through the helm\u2019s slit. That slit was just big enough for a dagger, but the throw would have to be perfect. He\u2019d have to be close. Deadly close.\r\nKaladin charged forward again. The Shardbearer swung his Blade out in the same wide sweep he\u2019d used to kill so many of Kaladin\u2019s men. Kaladin threw himself downward, skidding on his knees and bending backward. The Shardblade flashed above him, shearing the top of his spear free. The tip flipped up into the air, tumbling end over end.\r\nKaladin strained, hurling himself back onto his feet. He whipped his hand up, flinging his knife at the eyes watching from behind impervious armor. The dagger hit the faceplate just slightly off from the right angle, bouncing against the sides of the slit and ricocheting out.\r\nThe Shardbearer cursed, swinging his huge Blade back at Kaladin.\r\nKaladin landed on his feet, momentum still propelling him forward. Something flashed in the air beside him, falling toward the ground.\r\nThe spearhead.\r\nKaladin bellowed in defiance, spinning, snatching the spearhead from the air. It had been falling tip-down, and he caught it by the four inches of haft that remained, gripping it with his thumb on the stump, the sharp point extending down beneath his hand. The Shardbearer brought his weapon around as Kaladin skidded to a stop and flung his arm to the side,\r\nslammingthe spearhead right in the Shardbearer\u2019s visor slit.\r\nAll fell still.\r\nKaladin stood with his arm extended, the Shardbearer standing just to his right. Amaram had pulled himself halfway up the side of the shallow hollow. Kaladin\u2019s spearmates stood on the edge of the scene, gawking. Kaladin stood there, gasping, still gripping the haft of the spear, hand before the Shardbearer\u2019s face.\r\nThe Shardbearer creaked, then fell backward, crashing to the ground. His Blade dropped from his fingers, hitting the ground at an angle and digging into the stone.\r\nKaladin stumbled away, feeling drained. Stunned. Numbed. His men rushed up, halting in a group, staring at the fallen man. They were amazed, even a little reverent.\r\n\u201CIs he dead?\u201D Alabet asked softly.\r\n\u201CHe is,\u201D a voice said from the side.\r\nKaladin turned. Amaram still lay on the ground, but he had pulled off his helm, dark hair and beard slicked with sweat. \u201CIf he were still alive, his Blade would have vanished. His armor is falling off of him. He is dead. Blood of my ancestors\u2026you killed a Shardbearer!\u201D\r\nOddly, Kaladin wasn\u2019t surprised. Just exhausted. He looked around at the bodies of men who had been his dearest friends.\r\n\u201CTake it, Kaladin,\u201D Coreb said.\r\nKaladin turned, looking at the Shardblade, which sprouted at an angle into the stone, hilt toward the sky.\r\n\u201CTake it,\u201D Coreb said again. \u201CIt\u2019s yours. Stormfather, Kaladin. You\u2019re a\r\nShardbearer!\u201D\r\nKaladin stepped forward, dazed, raising his hand toward the hilt of the Blade. He hesitated just an inch away from it.\r\nEverything felt\r\nwrong.\r\nIf he took that Blade, he\u2019d become one of them. His eyes would even change, if the stories were right. Though the Blade glistened in the light, clean of the murders it had performed, for a moment it seemed red to him. Stained with Dallet\u2019s blood. Toorim\u2019s blood. The blood of the men who had been alive just moments before.\r\nIt was a treasure. Men traded kingdoms for Shardblades. The handful of darkeyed men who had won them lived forever in song and story.\r\nBut the thought of touching that Blade sickened him. It represented everything he\u2019d come to hate about the lighteyes, and it had just slaughtered men he loved dearly. He could not become a legend because of something like that. He looked at his reflection in the Blade\u2019s pitiless metal, then lowered his hand and turned away.\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s yours, Coreb,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CI give it to you.\u201D\r\n\u201C\r\nWhat?\u201D Coreb said from behind.\r\nAhead, Amaram\u2019s honor guard had finally returned, apprehensively appearing at the top of the small hollow, looking ashamed.\r\n\u201CWhat are you doing?\u201D Amaram demanded as Kaladin passed him. \u201CWhat\u2014Aren\u2019t you going to take the Blade?\u201D\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t want it,\u201D Kaladin said softly. \u201CI\u2019m giving it to my men.\u201D\r\nKaladin walked away, emotionally exhausted, tears on his cheeks as he climbed out of the hollow and shoved his way through the honor guard.\r\nHe walked back to the warcamp alone."

      "ChapterName": "48: STRAWBERRY",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\n\u201CThey take away the light, wherever they lurk. Skin that is burned.\u201D\r\n\u2014Cormshen, page 104.\r\nShallan sat quietly, propped up in a sterile, white-sheeted bed in one of Kharbranth\u2019s many hospitals. Her arm was wrapped in a neat, crisp bandage, and she held her drawing board in front of her. The nurses had reluctantly allowed her to sketch, so long as she did not \u201Cstress herself.\u201D\r\nHer arm ached; she\u2019d sliced herself more deeply than she\u2019d intended. She\u2019d hoped to simulate a wound from breaking the pitcher; she hadn\u2019t thought far enough ahead to realize how much like a suicide attempt it might seem. Though she\u2019d protested that she\u2019d simply fallen from bed, she could see that the nurses and ardents didn\u2019t accept it. She couldn\u2019t blame them.\r\nThe results were embarrassing, but at least nobody thought she might have Soulcast to make that blood. Embarrassment was worth escaping suspicion.\r\nShe continued her sketch. She was in a large, hallwaylike room in a Kharbranthian hospital, the walls lined with many beds. Other than obvious aggravations, her two days in the hospital had gone fairly well. She\u2019d had a lot of time to think about that strangest of afternoons, when she\u2019d seen ghosts, transformed glass to blood, and had an ardent offer to resign the ardentia to be with her.\r\nShe\u2019d done several drawings of this hospital room. The creatures lurked in her sketches, staying at the distant edges of the room. Their presence made it difficult for her to sleep, but she was slowly growing accustomed to them.\r\nThe air smelled of soap and lister\u2019s oil; she was bathed regularly and her arm washed with antiseptic to frighten away rotspren. About half of the beds held sick women, and there were wheeled fabric dividers with wooden frames that could be rolled around a bed for privacy. Shallan wore a plain white robe that untied at the front and had a long left sleeve that tied shut to protect her safehand.\r\nShe\u2019d transferred her safepouch to the robe, buttoning it inside the left sleeve. Nobody had looked in the pouch. When she\u2019d been washed, they\u2019d unbuttoned it and given it to her without a word, despite its unusual weight. One did not look in a woman\u2019s safepouch. Still, she kept hold of it whenever she could.\r\nIn the hospital, her every need was seen to, but she could not leave. It reminded her of being at home on her father\u2019s estates. More and more, that frightened her as much as the symbolheads did. She\u2019d tasted independence, and she didn\u2019t want to go back to what she had been. Coddled, pampered, displayed.\r\nUnfortunately, it was unlikely she\u2019d be able to return to studying with Jasnah. Her supposed suicide attempt gave her an excellent reason to return home. She had to go. To remain, sending the Soulcaster away on its own, would be selfish considering this opportunity to leave without arousing suspicion. Besides, she\u2019d used the Soulcaster. She could use the long trip home to figure out how she\u2019d done it, then be ready to help her family when she arrived.\r\nShe sighed, and then with a few shadings, she finished her sketch. It was a picture of that strange place she had gone. That distant horizon with its powerful yet cold sun. Clouds running toward it above, endless ocean below, making the sun look as if it were at the end of a long tunnel. Above the ocean hovered hundreds of flames, a sea of lights above the sea of glass beads.\r\nShe lifted the picture up, looking at the sketch underneath. It depicted her, huddled on her bed, surrounded by the strange creatures. She didn\u2019t\r\ndaretell Jasnah what she had seen, lest it reveal that she had Soulcast, and therefore committed the theft.\r\nThe next picture was one of her, lying on the ground amid the blood. She looked up from the sketchpad. A white-clothed female ardent sat against the wall nearby, pretending to sew but really keeping watch in case Shallan decided to harm herself again. Shallan made a thin line of her lips.\r\nIt\u2019s a good cover,she told herself.\r\nIt works perfectly. Stop being so embarrassed.\r\nShe turned to the last of her day\u2019s sketches. It depicted one of the symbolheads. No eyes, no face, just that jagged alien symbol with points like cut crystal. They\r\nhadto have something to do with the Soulcasting. Didn\u2019t they?\r\nI visited another place,she thought.\r\nI think\u2026I think I spoke with the spirit of the goblet.Did a\r\ngoblet, of all things, have a soul? Upon opening her pouch to check on the Soulcaster, she\u2019d found that the sphere Kabsal had given her had stopped glowing. She could remember a vague feeling of light and beauty, a raging storm inside of her.\r\nShe\u2019d taken the light from the sphere and given it to the goblet\u2014the\r\nsprenof the goblet\u2014as a bribe to transform. Was that how Soulcasting worked? Or was she just struggling to make connections?\r\nShallan lowered the sketchpad as visitors entered the room and began moving among the patients. Most of the women sat up excitedly as they saw King Taravangian, with his orange robes and kindly, aged air. He paused at each bed to chat. She\u2019d heard that he visited frequently, at least once a week.\r\nEventually he reached Shallan\u2019s bedside. He smiled at her, sitting as one of his many attendants placed a padded stool for him. \u201CAnd young Shallan Davar. I was so terribly saddened to hear of your accident. I apologize for not coming earlier. Duties of state kept me.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt is quite all right, Your Majesty.\u201D\r\n\u201CNo, no, it is not,\u201D he said. \u201CBut it is what must be. There are many who complain that I spend too much of my time here.\u201D\r\nShallan smiled. Those complaints were never vociferous. The landlords and house lords who played politics in court were quite content with a king who spent so much of his time outside the palace, ignoring their schemes.\r\n\u201CThis hospital is amazing, Your Majesty,\u201D she said. \u201CI can\u2019t believe how well everyone is cared for.\u201D\r\nHe smiled widely. \u201CMy great triumph. Lighteyes and darkeyes alike, nobody turned away\u2014not beggar, not whore, not sailor from afar. It\u2019s all paid for by the Palanaeum, you know. In a way, even the most obscure and useless record is helping heal the sick.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m glad to be here.\u201D\r\n\u201CI doubt that, child. A hospital such as this one is, perhaps, the only thing a man could pour so much money into and be delighted if it were never used. It is a tragedy that you must become my guest.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat I meant was that I\u2019d rather be sick here than somewhere else. Though I suppose that\u2019s a little like saying it\u2019s better to choke on wine than on dishwater.\u201D\r\nHe laughed. \u201CWhat a sweet thing you are,\u201D he said, rising. \u201CIs there anything I can do to improve your stay?\u201D\r\n\u201CEnd it?\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m afraid that I can\u2019t allow that,\u201D he said, eyes softening. \u201CI must defer to the wisdom of my surgeons and nurses. They say that you are still at risk. We must think of your health.\u201D\r\n\u201CKeeping me here gives me health at the expense of my wellness, Your Majesty.\u201D\r\nHe shook his head. \u201CYou mustn\u2019t be allowed to have another accident.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2026I understand. But I promise that I\u2019m feeling much better. The episode that struck me was caused by overwork. Now that I\u2019m relaxed, I\u2019m not in any further danger.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat is good,\u201D he said. \u201CBut we still need to keep you for a few more days.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes, Your Majesty. But could I at least have visitors?\u201D So far, the hospital staff had insisted that she was not to be bothered.\r\n\u201CYes\u2026I can see how that might help you. I\u2019ll speak to the ardents and suggest that you be allowed a few visitors.\u201D He hesitated. \u201COnce you are well again, it might be best for you to suspend your training.\u201D\r\nShe pasted a grimace on her face, trying not to feel sick at the charade. \u201CI hate to do that, Your Majesty. But I have been missing my family greatly. Perhaps I should return to them.\u201D\r\n\u201CAn excellent idea. I\u2019m certain the ardents will be more likely to release you if they know you\u2019ll be going home.\u201D He smiled in a kindly way, resting a hand on her shoulder. \u201CThis world, it is a tempest sometimes. But remember, the sun always rises again.\u201D\r\n\u201CThank you, Your Majesty.\u201D\r\nThe king moved away, visiting other patients, then speaking quietly with the ardents. Not five minutes passed before Jasnah walked through the doorway with her characteristic straight-backed stride. She wore a beautiful dress, deep blue with golden embroidery. Her sleek black hair was done in braids and pierced by six thin golden spikes; her cheeks glowed with blush, her lips bloodred with lip paint. She stood out in the white room like a flower upon a field of barren stone.\r\nShe glided toward Shallan on feet hidden beneath the loose folds of her silk skirt, carrying a thick book under her arm. An ardent brought her a stool, and she sat down where the king had just stood.\r\nJasnah regarded Shallan, face stiff, impassive. \u201CI have been told that my tutelage is demanding, perhaps harsh. This is one reason why I often refuse to take wards.\u201D\r\n\u201CI apologize for my weakness, Brightness,\u201D Shallan said, looking down.\r\nJasnah seemed displeased. \u201CI did not mean to suggest fault in you, child. I was attempting the opposite. Unfortunately I\u2019m\u2026unaccustomed to such behavior.\u201D\r\n\u201CApologizing?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes.\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, you see,\u201D Shallan said, \u201Cin order to grow proficient at apologizing, you must first make mistakes. That\u2019s your problem, Jasnah. You\u2019re absolutely terrible at making them.\u201D\r\nThe woman\u2019s expression softened. \u201CThe king mentioned to me that you would be returning to your family.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat? When?\u201D\r\n\u201CWhen he met me in the hallway outside,\u201D she said, \u201Cand finally gave me permission to visit you.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou make it sound as if you were waiting out there.\u201D\r\nJasnah didn\u2019t reply.\r\n\u201CBut your research!\u201D\r\n\u201CCan be done in the hospital waiting chamber.\u201D She hesitated. \u201CIt has been somewhat difficult for me to focus these last few days.\u201D\r\n\u201CJasnah! That\u2019s quite nearly\r\nhumanof you!\u201D\r\nJasnah regarded her reprovingly, and Shallan winced, immediately regretting the words. \u201CI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve learned poorly, haven\u2019t I?\u201D\r\n\u201COr perhaps you are just practicing the art of the apology. So that you will not be unsettled when the need arises, as I am.\u201D\r\n\u201CHow very clever of me.\u201D\r\n\u201CIndeed.\u201D\r\n\u201CCan I stop now, then?\u201D Shallan asked. \u201CI think I\u2019ve had quite enough practice.\u201D\r\n\u201CI should think,\u201D Jasnah said, \u201Cthat apology is an art of which we could use a few more masters. Do not use me as a model in this. Pride is often mistaken for faultlessness.\u201D She leaned forward. \u201CI am sorry, Shallan Davar. In overworking you, I may have done the world a disservice and stolen from it one of the great scholars of the rising generation.\u201D\r\nShallan blushed, feeling more foolish and guilty. Shallan\u2019s eyes flickered to her mistress\u2019s hand. Jasnah wore the black glove that hid the fake. In the fingers of her safehand, Shallan grasped the pouch holding the Soulcaster. If Jasnah only knew.\r\nJasnah took the book from beneath her arm and set it on the bed beside Shallan. \u201CThis is for you.\u201D\r\nShallan picked it up. She opened to the front page, but it was blank. The next one was as well, as were all inside of it. Her frown deepened, and she looked up at Jasnah.\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s called the\r\nBook of Endless Pages,\u201D Jasnah said.\r\n\u201CEr, I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s not endless, Brightness.\u201D She flipped to the last page and held it up.\r\nJasnah smiled. \u201CIt\u2019s a metaphor, Shallan. Many years ago, someone dear to me made a very good attempt at converting me to Vorinism. This was the method he used.\u201D\r\nShallan cocked her head.\r\n\u201CYou search for truth,\u201D Jasnah said, \u201Cbut you also hold to your faith. There is much to admire in that. Seek out the Devotary of Sincerity. They are one of the very smallest of the devotaries, but this book is their guide.\u201D\r\n\u201COne with blank pages?\u201D\r\n\u201CIndeed. They worship the Almighty, but are guided by the belief that there are always more answers to be found. The book cannot be filled, as there is always something to learn. This devotary is a place where one is never penalized for questions, even those challenging Vorinism\u2019s own tenets.\u201D She shook her head. \u201CI cannot explain their ways. You should be able to find them in Vedenar, though there are none in Kharbranth.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2026\u201D Shallan trailed off, noticing how Jasnah\u2019s hand rested fondly on the book. It was precious to her. \u201CI hadn\u2019t thought to find ardents who were willing to question their own beliefs.\u201D\r\nJasnah raised an eyebrow. \u201CYou will find wise men in any religion, Shallan, and good men in every nation. Those who\r\ntrulyseek wisdom are those who will acknowledge the virtue in their adversaries and who will learn from those who disabuse them of error. All others\u2014heretic, Vorin, Ysperist, or Maakian\u2014are equally closed-minded.\u201D She took her hand from the book, moving as if to stand up.\r\n\u201CHe\u2019s wrong,\u201D Shallan said suddenly, realizing something.\r\nJasnah turned to her.\r\n\u201CKabsal,\u201D Shallan said, blushing. \u201CHe says you\u2019re researching the Voidbringers because you want to prove that Vorinism is false.\u201D\r\nJasnah sniffed in derision. \u201CI would not dedicate four years of my life to such an empty pursuit. It\u2019s idiocy to try to prove a negative. Let the Vorin believe as they wish\u2014the wise among them will find goodness and solace in their faith; the fools would be fools no matter what they believed.\u201D\r\nShallan frowned. So why\r\nwasJasnah studying the Voidbringers?\r\n\u201CAh. Speak of the storm and it begins to bluster,\u201D Jasnah said, turning toward the room\u2019s entrance.\r\nWith a start, Shallan realized that Kabsal had just arrived, wearing his usual grey robes. He was arguing softly with a nurse, who pointed at the basket he carried. Finally, the nurse threw up her hands and walked away, leaving Kabsal to approach, triumphant. \u201CFinally!\u201D he said to Shallan. \u201COld Mungam can be a real tyrant.\u201D\r\n\u201CMungam?\u201D Shallan asked.\r\n\u201CThe ardent who runs this place,\u201D Kabsal said. \u201CI should have been allowed in immediately. After all, I know what you need to make you better!\u201D He pulled out a jar of jam, smiling broadly.\r\nJasnah remained on her stool, regarding Kabsal across the bed. \u201CI would have thought,\u201D she said dryly, \u201Cthat you would allow Shallan a respite, considering how your attentions drove her to despair.\u201D\r\nKabsal flushed. He looked at Shallan, and she could see the pleading in his eyes.\r\n\u201CIt wasn\u2019t you, Kabsal,\u201D Shallan said. \u201CI just\u2026I wasn\u2019t ready for life away from my family estate. I still don\u2019t know what came over me. I\u2019ve never done anything like that before.\u201D\r\nHe smiled, pulling a stool over for himself. \u201CI think,\u201D he said, \u201Cthat the lack of color in these places is what keeps people sick so long. That and the\u00A0lack of proper food.\u201D He winked, turning the jar toward Shallan. It was deep, dark red. \u201CStrawberry.\u201D\r\n\u201CNever heard of it,\u201D Shallan said.\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s exceedingly rare,\u201D Jasnah said, reaching for the jar. \u201CLike most plants from Shinovar, it can\u2019t grow other places.\u201D\r\nKabsal looked surprised as Jasnah removed the lid and dipped a finger into the jar. She hesitated, then raised a bit of the jam to her nose to sniff at it.\r\n\u201CI was under the impression that you disliked jam, Brightness Jasnah,\u201D Kabsal said.\r\n\u201CI do,\u201D she said. \u201CI was simply curious about the scent. I\u2019ve heard that strawberries are very distinctive.\u201D She screwed the lid back on, then wiped her finger on her cloth handkerchief.\r\n\u201CI brought bread as well,\u201D Kabsal said. He pulled out a small loaf of the fluffy bread. \u201CIt\u2019s nice of you not to blame me, Shallan, but I can see that my attentions were too forward. I thought, maybe, I could bring this and\u2026\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd what?\u201D Jasnah asked. \u201CAbsolve yourself? \u2018I\u2019m sorry I drove you to suicide. Here\u2019s some bread.\u2019\u201D\r\nHe blushed, looking down.\r\n\u201COf course I\u2019ll have some,\u201D Shallan said, glaring at Jasnah. \u201CAnd she will too. It was very kind of you, Kabsal.\u201D She took the bread, breaking off a chunk for Kabsal, one for herself, then one for Jasnah.\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D Jasnah said. \u201CThank you.\u201D\r\n\u201CJasnah,\u201D Shallan said. \u201CWould you please at least try some?\u201D It bothered her that the two of them got on so poorly.\r\nThe older woman sighed. \u201COh, very well.\u201D She took the bread, holding it as Shallan and Kabsal ate. The bread was moist and delicious, though Jasnah grimaced as she put hers in her mouth and chewed it.\r\n\u201CYou should really try the jam,\u201D Kabsal said to Shallan. \u201CStrawberry is hard to find. I had to make quite a number of inquiries.\u201D\r\n\u201CNo doubt bribing merchants with the king\u2019s money,\u201D Jasnah noted.\r\nKabsal sighed. \u201CBrightness Jasnah, I realize that you are not fond of me. But I\u2019m working very hard to be pleasant. Could you at least\r\npretendto do likewise?\u201D\r\nJasnah eyed Shallan, probably recalling Kabsal\u2019s guess that undermining Vorinism was the goal of her research. She didn\u2019t apologize, but also made no retort.\r\nGood enough,Shallan thought.\r\n\u201CThe jam, Shallan,\u201D Kabsal said, handing her a slice of bread for it.\r\n\u201COh, right.\u201D She removed the lid of the jar, holding it between her knees and using her freehand.\r\n\u201CYou missed your ship out, I assume,\u201D Kabsal said.\r\n\u201CYes.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat\u2019s this?\u201D Jasnah asked.\r\nShallan cringed. \u201CI was planning to leave, Brightness. I\u2019m sorry. I should have told you.\u201D\r\nJasnah settled back. \u201CI suppose it was to be expected, all things considered.\u201D\r\n\u201CThe jam?\u201D Kabsal prodded again.\r\nShallan frowned. He was particularly insistent about that jam. She raised the jar and sniffed at it, then pulled back. \u201CIt smells terrible! This is jam?\u201D It smelled like vinegar and slime.\r\n\u201CWhat?\u201D Kabsal said, alarmed. He took the jar, sniffing at it, then pulled away, looking nauseated.\r\n\u201CIt appears you got a bad jar,\u201D Jasnah said. \u201CThat\u2019s not how it\u2019s supposed to smell?\u201D\r\n\u201CNot at all,\u201D Kabsal said. He hesitated, then stuck his finger into the jam anyway, shoving a large glob into his mouth.\r\n\u201CKabsal!\u201D Shallan said. \u201CThat\u2019s revolting!\u201D\r\nHe coughed, but forced it down. \u201CNot so bad, really. You should try it.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat?\u201D\r\n\u201CReally,\u201D he said, forcing it toward her. \u201CI mean, I wanted this to be special, for you. And it turned out so horribly.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m\r\nnottasting that, Kabsal.\u201D\r\nHe hesitated, as if considering forcing it upon her. Why was he acting so strangely? He raised a hand to his head, stood up, and stumbled away from the bed.\r\nThen he began to rush from the room. He made it only halfway before crashing to the floor, his body sliding a little way across the spotless stone.\r\n\u201CKabsal!\u201D Shallan said, leaping out of the bed, hurrying to his side, wearing only the white robe. He was shaking. And\u2026and\u2026\r\nAnd so was she. The room was spinning. Suddenly she felt very, very tired. She tried to stand, but slipped, dizzy. She barely felt herself hit the floor.\r\nSomeone was kneeling above her, cursing.\r\nJasnah. Her voice was distant. \u201CShe\u2019s been poisoned. I need a garnet. Bring me a garnet!\u201D\r\nThere\u2019s one in my pouch,Shallan thought. She fumbled with it, managing to undo the tie of her safehand\u2019s sleeve.\r\nWhy\u2026why does she want\u2026\r\nBut no, I can\u2019t show her that. The Soulcaster!\r\nHer mind was so fuzzy.\r\n\u201CShallan,\u201D Jasnah\u2019s voice said, anxious, very soft. \u201CI\u2019m going to have to Soulcast your blood to purify it. It will be dangerous.\r\nExtremelydangerous. I\u2019m not good with flesh or blood. It\u2019s not where my talent lies.\u201D\r\nShe needs it. To save me.Weakly, she reached in and pulled out her safepouch with her right hand. \u201CYou\u2026can\u2019t\u2026\u201D\r\n\u201CHush, child. Where is that garnet!\u201D\r\n\u201CYou can\u2019t Soulcast,\u201D Shallan said weakly, pulling the ties of her pouch open. She upended it, vaguely seeing a fuzzy golden object slip out onto the floor, alongside the garnet that Kabsal had given her.\r\nStormfather! Why was the room spinning so much?\r\nJasnah gasped. Distantly.\r\nFading\u2026\r\nSomething happened. A flash of warmth burned through Shallan, something\r\ninsideher skin, as if she had been dumped into a steaming hot cauldron. She screamed, arching her back, her muscles spasming.\r\nAll went black."

      "ChapterName": "49: TO CARE",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\n\u201CRadiant / of birthplace / the announcer comes / to come announce / the birthplace of Radiants.\u201D\r\n\u2014Though I am not overly fond of the ketek poetic form as a means of conveying information, this one by Allahn is often quoted in reference to Urithiru. I believe some mistook the home of the Radiants for their birthplace.\r\nThe towering walls of the chasm rising on either side of Kaladin dripped with greenish grey moss. His torch\u2019s flames danced, light reflecting on slick, rain-wetted sections of stone. The humid air was chilly, and the highstorm had left puddles and ponds. Spindly bones\u2014an ulna and a radius\u2014poked from a deep puddle Kaladin passed. He didn\u2019t look to see if the rest of the skeleton was there.\r\nFlash floods,Kaladin thought, listening to the scraping steps of the bridgemen behind him.\r\nThat water has to go somewhere, otherwise we\u2019d have canals to cross instead of chasms.\r\nKaladin didn\u2019t know if he could trust his dream or not, but he\u2019d asked around, and it was true that the eastern edge of the Shattered Plains was more open than the western side. The plateaus had been worn away. If the bridgemen could get there, they might be able to flee to the east.\r\nMight. Many chasmfiends lived in that area, and Alethi scouts patrolled the perimeter beyond. If Kaladin\u2019s team met them, they would have trouble explaining what a group of armed men\u2014many with slave brands\u2014was doing there.\r\nSyl walked along the wall of the chasm, about level with Kaladin\u2019s head. Groundspren didn\u2019t pull her downward as they did everything else. She walked with her hands clasped behind her back, her tiny, knee-length skirt fluttering in an intangible wind.\r\nEscape to the east. It seemed unlikely. The highprinces had tried\r\nveryhard to explore that way, looking for a route to the center of the Plains. They\u2019d failed. Chasmfiends had killed some groups. Others had been caught in the chasms during highstorms, despite precautions. It was impossible to predict the storms perfectly.\r\nOther scouting parties had avoided those two fates. They\u2019d used enormous extensible ladders to climb atop plateaus during highstorms. They\u2019d lost many men, though, as the plateau tops provided poor cover during storms, and you couldn\u2019t bring wagons or other shelter with you into the chasms. The bigger problem, he\u2019d heard, had been the Parshendi patrols. They\u2019d found and killed dozens of scouting parties.\r\n\u201CKaladin?\u201D Teft asked, hustling up, splashing through a puddle where bits of empty cremling carapace floated. \u201CYou all right?\u201D\r\n\u201CFine.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou look thoughtful.\u201D\r\n\u201CMore breakfast-full,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CThat gruel was particularly dense this morning.\u201D\r\nTeft smiled. \u201CI never took you for the glib type.\u201D\r\n\u201CI used to be more so. I get it from my mother. You could rarely say anything to her without getting it twisted about and tossed back to you.\u201D\r\nTeft nodded. They walked in silence for a time, the bridgemen behind laughing as Dunny told a story about the first girl he\u2019d ever kissed.\r\n\u201CSon,\u201D Teft said, \u201Chave you felt anything strange lately?\u201D\r\n\u201CStrange? What kind of strange?\u201D\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know. Just\u2026anything odd?\u201D He coughed. \u201CYou know, like odd surges of strength? The\u2026er, feeling that you\u2019re light?\u201D\r\n\u201CThe feeling that I\u2019m\r\nwhat?\u201D\r\n\u201CLight. Er, maybe, like your head is light. Light-headed. That sort of thing. Storm it, boy, I\u2019m just checking to see if you\u2019re still sick. You were beat up pretty badly by that highstorm.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m fine,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CRemarkably so, actually.\u201D\r\n\u201COdd, eh?\u201D\r\nIt\r\nwasodd. It fed his nagging worry that he was subject to some kind of supernatural curse of the type that were supposed to happen to people who sought the Old Magic. There were stories of evil men made immortal, then tortured over and over again\u2014like Extes, who had his arms torn off each day for sacrificing his son to the Voidbringers in exchange for knowledge of the day of his death. It was just a tale, but tales came from somewhere.\r\nKaladin lived when everyone else died. Was that the work of some spren from Damnation, toying with him like a windspren, but infinitely more nefarious? Letting him think that he might be able to do some good, then killing everyone he tried to help? There were supposed to be thousands of kinds of spren, many that people never saw or didn\u2019t know about. Syl followed him. Could some kind of evil spren be doing the same?\r\nA very disturbing thought.\r\nSuperstition is useless,he told himself forcefully.\r\nThink on it too much, and you\u2019ll end up like Durk, insisting that you need to wear your lucky boots into every battle.\r\nThey reached a section where the chasm forked, splitting around a plateau high above. Kaladin turned to face the bridgemen. \u201CThis is as good a place as any.\u201D The bridgemen stopped, bunching up. He could see the anticipation in their eyes, the excitement.\r\nHe\u2019d felt that once, back before he\u2019d known the soreness and the pain of practice. Oddly, Kaladin felt he was now both more in awe of\r\nandmore disappointed in the spear than he\u2019d been as a youth. He loved the focus, the feeling of certainty that he felt when he fought. But that hadn\u2019t saved those who followed him.\r\n\u201CThis is where I\u2019m supposed to tell you what a sorry group you are,\u201D Kaladin said to the men. \u201CIt\u2019s the way I\u2019ve always seen it done. The training sergeant tells the recruits that they are pathetic. He points out their weakness, perhaps spars with a few of them, tossing them on their backsides to teach them humility. I did that a few times myself when training new spearmen.\u201D\r\nKaladin shook his head. \u201CToday, that\u2019s not how we\u2019ll begin. You men don\u2019t need humbling. You don\u2019t dream of glory. You dream of survival. Most of all, you\r\naren\u2019tthe sad, unprepared group of recruits most sergeants have to deal with. You\u2019re tough. I\u2019ve seen you run for miles carrying a bridge. You\u2019re brave. I\u2019ve seen you charge straight at a line of archers. You\u2019re determined. Otherwise you wouldn\u2019t be here, right now, with me.\u201D\r\nKaladin walked to the side of the chasm and extracted a discarded spear from some flood-strewn rubble. Once he had it, however, he realized that the spearhead had been knocked off. He almost tossed it aside, then reconsidered.\r\nSpears were dangerous for him to hold. They made him want to fight, and might lead him to think he was who he\u2019d once been: Kaladin Stormblessed, confident squadleader. He wasn\u2019t that man any longer.\r\nIt seemed that whenever he picked up weapons, the people around him died\u2014friends as well as foes. So, for now, it seemed good to hold this length of wood; it was just a staff. Nothing more. A stick he could use for training.\r\nHe could face returning to the spear another time.\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s good that you\u2019re already prepared,\u201D Kaladin said to the men. \u201CBecause we don\u2019t have the six weeks I was given to train a new batch of recruits. In six weeks, Sadeas will have half of us dead. I intend to see you all drinking mudbeer in a tavern somewhere safe by the time six weeks have passed.\u201D\r\nSeveral of them gave a kind of half-cheer at that.\r\n\u201CWe\u2019ll have to be fast,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CI\u2019ll have to push you hard. That\u2019s our only option.\u201D He glanced at the spear haft. \u201CThe first thing you need to learn is that it\u2019s all right to care.\u201D\r\nThe twenty-three bridgemen stood in a double row. All had wanted to come. Even Leyten, who had been hurt so badly. They didn\u2019t have any who were wounded so badly they couldn\u2019t walk, although Dabbid continued to\u00A0stare off at nothing. Rock stood with his arms folded, apparently with no\u00A0intention of learning to fight. Shen, the parshman, stood at the very back. He looked at the ground. Kaladin didn\u2019t intend to put a spear in his hands.\r\nSeveral of the bridgemen seemed confused by what Kaladin had said about emotions, though Teft just raised an eyebrow and Moash yawned. \u201CWhat do you mean?\u201D Drehy asked. He was a lanky blond man, long-limbed and muscled. He spoke with a faint accent; he was from somewhere far to the west, called Rianal.\r\n\u201CA lot of soldiers,\u201D Kaladin said, running his thumb across the pole, feeling the grain of the wood, \u201Cthey think that you fight the best if you\u2019re passionless and cold. I think that\u2019s stormleavings. Yes, you need to be focused. Yes, emotions are dangerous. But if you don\u2019t care about anything, what are you? An animal, driven only to kill. Our passion is what makes us human. We\r\nhaveto fight for a reason. So I say that it\u2019s all right to care. We\u2019ll talk about controlling your fear and anger, but remember this as the first lesson I taught you.\u201D\r\nSeveral of the bridgemen nodded. Most seemed confused still. Kaladin remembered being there, wondering why Tukks wasted time talking about emotions. He\u2019d thought he understood emotion\u2014his drive to learn the spear had come\r\nbecauseof his emotions. Vengeance. Hatred. A lust for the power to exact retribution on Varth and the soldiers of his squad.\r\nHe looked up, trying to banish those memories. No, the bridgemen didn\u2019t understand his words about caring, but perhaps they would remember later, as Kaladin had.\r\n\u201CThe second lesson,\u201D Kaladin said, slapping the decapitated spear to the rock beside him with a crack that echoed down the chasm, \u201Cis more utilitarian. Before you can learn to fight, you\u2019re going to have to learn how to stand.\u201D He dropped the spear. The bridgemen watched him with frowns of disappointment.\r\nKaladin fell into a basic spearman\u2019s stance, feet wide apart\u2014but not too wide\u2014turned sideways, knees bent in a loose crouch. \u201CSkar, I want you to come try to push me backward.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat?\u201D\r\n\u201CTry and throw me off balance,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CForce me to stumble.\u201D\r\nSkar shrugged and walked forward. He tried to shove Kaladin back, but Kaladin easily knocked his hands aside with a quick snap of the wrist. Skar cursed and came at him again, but Kaladin caught his arm and shoved him backward, causing Skar to stumble.\r\n\u201CDrehy, come help him,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CMoash, you too. Try to force me off balance.\u201D\r\nThe other two joined Skar. Kaladin stepped around the attacks, staying squarely in the middle of them, adjusting his stance to rebuff each attempt. He grabbed Drehy\u2019s arm and yanked him forward, nearly causing him to fall. He stepped into Skar\u2019s shoulder-rush, deflecting the weight of the man\u2019s body and throwing him backward. He pulled back as Moash got his arms on him, causing Moash to overbalance himself.\r\nKaladin remained completely unfazed, weaving between them and adjusting his center of balance by bending his knees and positioning his feet. \u201CCombat begins with the legs,\u201D Kaladin said as he evaded the attacks. \u201CI don\u2019t care how fast you are with a jab, how accurate you are with a thrust. If your opponent can trip you, or make you stumble, you\u2019ll lose. Losing means dying.\u201D\r\nSeveral of the watching bridgemen tried to imitate Kaladin, crouching down. Skar, Drehy, and Moash had finally decided to try a coordinated rush, planning to all tackle Kaladin at once. Kaladin held up his hand. \u201CWell done, you three.\u201D He motioned them back to stand with the others. They reluctantly broke off their attacks.\r\n\u201CI\u2019m going to split you into pairs,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CWe\u2019re going to spend all day today\u2014and probably each day this week\u2014working on stances. Learning to maintain one, learning to not lock your knees the moment you\u2019re threatened, learning to hold your center of balance. It will take time, but I promise you if we start here, you\u2019ll learn to be deadly far more quickly. Even if it seems that all you\u2019re doing at first is standing around.\u201D\r\nThe men nodded.\r\n\u201CTeft,\u201D Kaladin ordered. \u201CSplit them into pairs by size and weight, then run them through an elementary forward spear stance.\u201D\r\n\u201CAye, sir!\u201D Teft barked. Then he froze, realizing what he\u2019d given away. The speed at which he\u2019d responded made it obvious that Teft had been a soldier. Teft met Kaladin\u2019s eyes and saw that Kaladin knew. The older man scowled, but Kaladin returned a grin. He had a veteran under his command; that was going to make this all a lot easier.\r\nTeft didn\u2019t feign ignorance, and easily fell into the role of the training sergeant, splitting the men into pairs, correcting their stances.\r\nNo wonder he never takes off that shirt,Kaladin thought.\r\nIt probably hides a mess of scars.\r\nAs Teft instructed the men, Kaladin pointed to Rock, gesturing him over.\r\n\u201CYes?\u201D Rock asked. The man was so broad of chest that his bridgeman\u2019s vest could barely fasten.\r\n\u201CYou said something before,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CAbout fighting being beneath you?\u201D\r\n\u201CIs true. I am not a fourth son.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat does that have to do with it?\u201D\r\n\u201CFirst son and second son are needed for making food,\u201D Rock said, raising a finger. \u201CIs most important. Without food, nobody lives, yes? Third son is craftsman. This is me. I serve proudly. Only fourth son can be warrior. Warriors, they are not needed as much as food or crafts. You see?\u201D\r\n\u201CYour profession is determined by your birth order?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D Rock said proudly. \u201CIs best way. On the Peaks, there is always food. Not every family has four sons. So not always is a soldier needed. I cannot fight. What man could do this thing before the\r\nUli\u2019tekanaki?\u201D\r\nKaladin shot a glance at Syl. She shrugged, not seeming to care what Rock did. \u201CAll right,\u201D he said. \u201CI\u2019ve got something else I want you to do, then. Go grab Lopen, Dabbid\u2026\u201D Kaladin hesitated. \u201CAnd Shen. Get him too.\u201D\r\nRock did so. Lopen was in the line, learning the stances, though Dabbid\u2014as usual\u2014stood off to the side, staring at nothing in particular. Whatever had taken him, it was far worse than regular battle shock. Shen stood beside him, hesitant, as if not certain of his place.\r\nRock pulled Lopen out of the line, then grabbed Dabbid and Shen and walked back to Kaladin.\r\n\u201CGancho,\u201D Lopen said, with a lazy salute. \u201CGuess I\u2019ll make a poor spearman, with one hand.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s all right,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CI have something else I need you to do. We\u2019ll see trouble from Gaz and our new captain\u2014or at least his wife\u2014if we don\u2019t bring back salvage.\u201D\r\n\u201CWe three cannot do the work of thirty, Kaladin,\u201D Rock said, scratching at his beard. \u201CIs not possible.\u201D\r\n\u201CMaybe not,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CBut most of our time down in these chasms is spent looking for corpses that haven\u2019t been picked clean. I think we can work a lot faster. We\r\nneedto work a lot faster, if we\u2019re going to train with the spear. Fortunately, we have an advantage.\u201D\r\nHe held out his hand, and Syl alighted on it. He\u2019d spoken to her earlier, and she\u2019d agreed to his plan. He didn\u2019t notice her doing anything special, but Lopen suddenly gasped. Syl had made herself visible to him.\r\n\u201CAh\u2026\u201D Rock said, bowing in respect to Syl. \u201CLike gathering reeds.\u201D\r\n\u201CWell flick my sparks,\u201D Lopen said. \u201CRock, you never said it was so pretty!\u201D\r\nSyl smiled broadly.\r\n\u201CBe respectful,\u201D Rock said. \u201CIs not for you to speak of her in that way, little person.\u201D\r\nThe men knew about Syl, of course. Kaladin didn\u2019t speak of her, but they saw him talking to the air, and Rock had explained.\r\n\u201CLopen,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CSyl can move far more quickly than a bridgeman. She will search out places for you to gather, and you four can pick through things quickly.\u201D\r\n\u201CDangerous,\u201D Rock said. \u201CWhat if we meet chasmfiend while alone?\u201D\r\n\u201CUnfortunately, we can\u2019t come back empty-handed. The\r\nlastthing we want is Hashal deciding to send Gaz down to supervise.\u201D\r\nLopen snorted. \u201CHe\u2019d never do that, gancho. Too much work down here.\u201D\r\n\u201CToo dangerous too,\u201D Rock added.\r\n\u201CEveryone says that,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CBut I\u2019ve never seen more than these scrapes on the walls.\u201D\r\n\u201CThey\u2019re down here,\u201D Rock said. \u201CIs not just legend. Just before you came, half a bridge crew was killed. Eaten. Most beasts come to the middle plateaus, but there are some who come this far.\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, I hate to put you in danger, but unless we try this, we\u2019ll have chasm duty taken from us and we\u2019ll end up cleaning latrines instead.\u201D\r\n\u201CAll right, gancho,\u201D Lopen said. \u201CI\u2019ll go.\u201D\r\n\u201CAs will I,\u201D Rock said. \u201CWith\r\nali\u2019i\u2019kamurato protect, perhaps it will be safe.\u201D\r\n\u201CI intend to teach you to fight eventually,\u201D Kaladin said. Then as Rock frowned, Kaladin hastily added, \u201CYou, Lopen, I mean. One arm doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re useless. You\u2019ll be at a disadvantage, but there are things I can teach you to deal with that. Right now a scavenger is more important to us than another spear.\u201D\r\n\u201CSounds swift to me.\u201D Lopen gestured to Dabbid, and the two walked over to gather sacks for the collecting. Rock moved to join them, but Kaladin took his arm.\r\n\u201CI haven\u2019t given up on finding an easier way out of here than fighting,\u201D Kaladin said to him. \u201CIf we never returned, Gaz and the others would probably just assume that a chasmfiend got us. If there\u2019s some way to reach the other side\u2026\u201D\r\nRock looked skeptical. \u201CMany have searched for this thing.\u201D\r\n\u201CThe eastern edge is open.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D Rock said, laughing, \u201Cand when you are able to travel that far without being eaten by chasmfiend or killed in floods, I shall name you my\r\nkaluk\u2019i\u2019iki.\u201D\r\nKaladin raised an eyebrow.\r\n\u201COnly a woman can be\r\nkaluk\u2019i\u2019iki,\u201D Rock said, as if that explained the joke.\r\n\u201CWife?\u201D\r\nRock laughed even louder. \u201CNo, no. Airsick lowlanders. Ha!\u201D\r\n\u201CGreat. Look, see if you can memorize the chasms, perhaps make a map of some kind. I suspect that most who come down here stick to the established routes. That means we\u2019re much more likely to find salvage down side passages; that\u2019s where I\u2019ll be sending Syl.\u201D\r\n\u201CSide passages?\u201D Rock said, still amused. \u201COne might begin to think you\r\nwantme to be eaten. Ha, and by a greatshell. They are supposed to be tast\r\ned, not tast\r\ning.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CNo, no,\u201D Rock said. \u201CIs a good plan. I only jest. I can be careful, and this will be good for me to do, since I do not wish to fight.\u201D\r\n\u201CThank you. Maybe you\u2019ll happen upon a place we could climb out.\u201D\r\n\u201CI will do this thing,\u201D Rock said, nodding. \u201CBut we cannot simply climb out. The army has many scouts on the Plains. Is how they know when chasmfiends come to pupate, eh? They will see us, and we will not be able to cross chasms without bridge.\u201D\r\nIt was a good argument, unfortunately. Climb up here, and they\u2019d be seen. Climb out in the middle, and they\u2019d be stuck on plateaus without anywhere to go. Climb out closer to the Parshendi areas, and they\u2019d be found by their scouts. That was assuming they\r\ncouldget out of the chasms. Though some were as shallow as forty or fifty feet, many were well over a hundred feet deep.\r\nSyl zipped away to lead Rock and his crew, and Kaladin moved back to the main body of bridgemen to help Teft correct stances. It was difficult work; the first day always was. The bridgemen were sloppy and uncertain.\r\nBut they also showed remarkable resolve. Kaladin had never worked with a group who made fewer complaints. The bridgemen didn\u2019t ask for a break. They didn\u2019t shoot him resentful glances when he pushed them harder. The scowls they bore were at their own foibles, angry at themselves for not learning faster.\r\nAnd they got it. After just a few hours, the more talented of them\u2014Moash at the forefront\u2014started to change into fighting men. Their stances grew firmer, more confident. When they should have been feeling exhausted and frustrated, they were more determined.\r\nKaladin stepped back, watching Moash fall into his stance after Teft shoved him. It was a resetting exercise\u2014Moash would let Teft knock him backward, then would scramble back and set his feet. Time and time again. The purpose was to train oneself to revert to the stance without thinking. Kaladin normally wouldn\u2019t have started resetting exercises until the second or third day. Yet here, Moash was drinking it in after only two hours. There were two others\u2014Drehy and Skar\u2014who were nearly as quick to learn.\r\nKaladin leaned back against the stone wall. Cold water leaked down the rock beside him, and a frillbloom plant hesitantly opened its fanlike fronds beside his head: two wide, orange leaves, with spines on the tips, unfolding like opening fists.\r\nIs it their bridgeman training?Kaladin wondered.\r\nOr is it their passion?He had given them a chance to fight back. That kind of opportunity changed a man.\r\nWatching them stand resolute and capable in stances they had only been just been taught, Kaladin realized something. These men\u2014cast off by the army, forced to work themselves near to death, then fed extra food by\u00A0Kaladin\u2019s careful planning\u2014were the most fit, training-ready recruits he\u2019d ever been given.\r\nBy seeking to beat them down, Sadeas had prepared them to excel."

      "ChapterName": "50: BACKBREAKER POWDER",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\n\u201CFlame and char. Skin so terrible. Eyes like pits of blackness.\u201D\r\n\u2014A quote from the\r\nIviadprobably needs no reference notation, but this comes from line 482, should I need to locate it quickly.\r\nShallan awoke in a small white room.\r\nShe sat up, feeling oddly healthy. Bright sunlight illuminated the window\u2019s gossamer white shades, bursting through the cloth and into the room. Shallan frowned, shaking her muddled head. She felt as if she should be burned toes to ears, her skin flaking off. But that was just a memory. She had the cut on her arm, but otherwise she felt perfectly well.\r\nA rustling sound. She turned to see a nurse hurrying away down a white hallway outside; the woman had apparently seen Shallan sit up, and was now taking the news to someone.\r\nI\u2019m in the hospital,Shallan thought.\r\nMoved to a private room.\r\nA soldier peeked in, inspecting Shallan. It was apparently a guarded room.\r\n\u201CWhat happened?\u201D she called to him. \u201CI was poisoned, wasn\u2019t I?\u201D She felt a sudden shock of alarm. \u201CKabsal! Is he all right?\u201D\r\nThe guard just turned back to his post. Shallan began to crawl out of bed, but he looked in again, glaring at her. She yelped despite herself, pulling up the sheet and settling back. She still wore one of the hospital robes, much like a soft bathing robe.\r\nHow long had she been unconscious? Why was she\u2014\r\nThe Soulcaster!she realized.\r\nI gave it back to Jasnah.\r\nThe next half hour was one of the most miserable in Shallan\u2019s life. She spent it suffering the periodic glares of the guard and feeling nauseated. What had happened?\r\nFinally, Jasnah appeared at the other end of the hallway. She was wearing a different dress, black with light grey piping. She strode toward the room like an arrow and dismissed the guard with a single word as she passed. The man hurried away, his boots louder on the stone floor than Jasnah\u2019s slippers.\r\nJasnah came in, and though she made no accusations, her glare was so hostile that Shallan wanted to crawl under her covers and hide. No. She wanted to crawl under the bed, dig down into the floor itself, and put stone between herself and those eyes.\r\nShe settled for looking downward in shame.\r\n\u201CYou were wise to return the Soulcaster,\u201D Jasnah said, voice like ice. \u201CIt saved your life.\r\nIsaved your life.\u201D\r\n\u201CThank you,\u201D Shallan whispered.\r\n\u201CWho are you working with? Which devotary bribed you to steal the fabrial?\u201D\r\n\u201CNone of them, Brightness. I stole it of my own volition.\u201D\r\n\u201CProtecting them does you no good. Eventually you\r\nwilltell me the truth.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt is the truth,\u201D Shallan said, looking up, feeling a hint of defiance. \u201CIt\u2019s why I became your ward in the first place. To steal that Soulcaster.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes, but for whom?\u201D\r\n\u201CFor\r\nme,\u201D Shallan said. \u201CIs it so hard to believe that I could act for myself? Am I such a miserable failure that the only rational answer is to assume I was duped or manipulated?\u201D\r\n\u201CYou have no grounds to raise your voice to me, child,\u201D Jasnah said evenly. \u201CAnd you have\r\neveryreason to remember your place.\u201D\r\nShallan looked down again.\r\nJasnah was silent for a time. Finally, she sighed. \u201CWhat were you\r\nthinking, child?\u201D\r\n\u201CMy father is dead.\u201D\r\n\u201CSo?\u201D\r\n\u201CHe was not well liked, Brightness. Actually, he was\r\nhated, and our family is bankrupt. My brothers are trying to put up a strong front by pretending he still lives. But\u2026\u201D Dared she tell Jasnah that her father had possessed a Soulcaster? Doing so wouldn\u2019t help excuse what Shallan had done, and might get her family more deeply into trouble. \u201CWe needed something. An edge. A way to earn money quickly, or\r\ncreatemoney.\u201D\r\nJasnah was silent again. When she finally spoke, she sounded faintly amused. \u201CYou thought your salvation lay in enraging not only all the entire ardentia, but Alethkar? Do you realize what my brother would have done if he\u2019d learned of this?\u201D\r\nShallan looked away, feeling both foolish and ashamed.\r\nJasnah sighed. \u201CSometimes I forget how young you are. I can see how the theft might have looked tempting to you. It was stupid nonetheless. I\u2019ve arranged passage back to Jah Keved. You will leave in the morning.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2014\u201D It was more than she deserved. \u201CThank you.\u201D\r\n\u201CYour friend, the ardent, is dead.\u201D\r\nShallan looked up, dismayed. \u201CWhat happened?\u201D\r\n\u201CThe bread was poisoned. Backbreaker powder. Very lethal, dusted over the bread to look like flour. I suspect the bread was similarly treated every time he visited. His goal was to get me to eat a piece.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut I ate a\r\nlotof that bread!\u201D\r\n\u201CThe jam had the antidote,\u201D Jasnah said. \u201CWe found it in several empty jars he\u2019d used.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt can\u2019t be!\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve begun investigating,\u201D Jasnah said. \u201CI should have done so immediately. Nobody quite remembers where this \u2018Kabsal\u2019 came from. Though he spoke familiarly of the other ardents to you and me, they knew him only vaguely.\u201D\r\n\u201CThen he\u2026\u201D\r\n\u201CHe was playing you, child. The whole time, he was using you to get to me. To spy on what I was doing, to kill me if he could.\u201D She spoke of it so evenly, so emotionlessly. \u201CI believe he used much more of the powder during this last attempt, more than he\u2019d ever used before, perhaps hoping to get me to breathe it in. He realized this would be his last opportunity. It turned against him, however, working more quickly than he\u2019d anticipated.\u201D\r\nSomeone had almost killed her. Not someone,\r\nKabsal. No wonder he\u2019d been so eager to get her to taste the jam!\r\n\u201CI\u2019m very disappointed in you, Shallan,\u201D Jasnah said. \u201CI can see now why you tried to end your own life. It was the guilt.\u201D\r\nShe\r\nhadn\u2019ttried to kill herself. But what good would it do to admit that? Jasnah was taking pity on her; best not to give her reason not to. But what of the strange things Shallan had seen and experienced? Might Jasnah have an explanation for them?\r\nLooking at Jasnah, seeing the cold rage hidden behind her calm exterior, frightened Shallan enough that her questions about the symbolheads and the strange place she\u2019d visited died on her lips. How had Shallan ever thought of herself as brave? She wasn\u2019t brave. She was a fool. She remembered the times her father\u2019s rage had echoed through the house. Jasnah\u2019s quieter, move justified anger was no less daunting.\r\n\u201CWell, you will need to learn to live with your guilt,\u201D Jasnah said. \u201CYou might not have escaped with my fabrial, but you\r\nhavethrown away a very promising career. This foolish scheme will stain your life for decades. No woman will take you as a ward now. You\r\nthrew it away.\u201D She shook her head in distaste. \u201CI hate being wrong.\u201D\r\nWith that, she turned to leave.\r\nShallan raised a hand.\r\nI have to apologize. I have to say something.\u201CJasnah?\u201D\r\nThe woman did not look back, and the guard did not return.\r\nShallan curled up under the sheet, stomach in knots, feeling so sick that\u2014for a moment\u2014she wished that she\u2019d actually dug that shard of glass in a little deeper. Or maybe that Jasnah hadn\u2019t been quick enough with the Soulcaster to save her.\r\nShe\u2019d lost it all. No fabrial to protect her family, no wardship to continue her studies. No Kabsal. She\u2019d never actually had him in the first place.\r\nHer tears dampened the sheets as the sunlight outside faded, then vanished. Nobody came to check on her.\r\nNobody cared."

      "ChapterName": "51: SAS NAHN",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\nONE YEAR AGO\r\nKaladin sat quietly in the waiting room of Amaram\u2019s wooden warcenter. It was constructed of a dozen study sections that could be disconnected and pulled by chulls. Kaladin sat beside a window, looking out at the camp. There was a hole where Kaladin\u2019s squad had been housed. He could make it out from where he sat. Their tents had been broken down and given to other squads.\r\nFour of his men remained. Four, out of twenty-six. And men called him lucky. Men called him Stormblessed. He\u2019d begun to believe that.\r\nI killed a Shardbearer today, he thought, mind numb.\r\nLike Lanacin the Surefooted, or Evod Markmaker. Me. I killed one.\r\nAnd he didn\u2019t care.\r\nHe crossed his arms on the wooden windowsill. There was no glass in the window and he could feel the breeze. A windspren flitted from one tent to another. Behind Kaladin, the room had a thick red rug and shields on the walls. There were a number of padded wooden chairs, like the one Kaladin sat in. This was the \u201Csmall\u201D waiting chamber of the warcenter\u2014small, yet larger than his entire house back in Hearthstone, the surgery included.\r\nI killed a Shardbearer,he thought again.\r\nAnd then I gave away the Blade and Plate.\r\nThat single event had to be the most monumentally stupid thing anyone, in any kingdom, in any era, had ever done. As a Shardbearer, Kaladin would have been more important than Roshone\u2014more important than Amaram. He\u2019d have been able to go to the Shattered Plains and fight in a real war.\r\nNo more squabbling over borders. No more petty lighteyed captains belonging to unimportant families, bitter because they\u2019d been left behind. He would never again have had to worry about blisters from boots that didn\u2019t fit, dinner slop that tasted of crem, or other soldiers who wanted to pick a fight.\r\nHe could have been rich. He\u2019d given it all away, just like that.\r\nAnd\r\nstill, the mere thought of touching that Blade turned his stomach. He didn\u2019t want wealth, titles, armies, or even a good meal. He wanted to be able to go back and protect the men who had trusted him. Why had he chased after the Shardbearer? He should have run. But no, he\u2019d insisted on charging at a storming\r\nShardbearer.\r\nYou protected your highmarshal,he told himself.\r\nYou\u2019re a hero.\r\nBut why was Amaram\u2019s life worth more than those of his men? Kaladin served Amaram because of the honor he had shown. He let spearmen share his comfort in the warcenter during highstorms, a different squad each storm. He insisted that his men be well fed and well paid. He didn\u2019t treat them like slime.\r\nHe did let his subordinates do so, though. And he\u2019d broken his promise to shelter Tien.\r\nSo did I. So did I\u2026.\r\nKaladin\u2019s insides were a twisted mess of guilt and sorrow. One thing remained clear, like a bright spot of light on the wall of a dark room. He wanted nothing to do with those Shards. He didn\u2019t even want to touch them.\r\nThe door thumped open, and Kaladin turned in his chair. Amaram entered. Tall, lean, with a square face and long martial coat of deep green. He walked on a crutch. Kaladin eyed the wrappings and splint with a critical eye.\r\nI could have done better.He\u2019d also have insisted that the patient remain in bed.\r\nAmaram was talking to one of his stormwardens, a middle-aged man with a square beard and robes of deep black.\r\n\u201C\u2026why Thaidakar would risk this?\u201D Amaram was saying, speaking in a soft voice. \u201CBut who else would it be? The Ghostbloods grow more bold. We\u2019ll need to find out who he was. Do we know anything about him?\u201D\r\n\u201CHe was Veden, Brightlord,\u201D the stormwarden said. \u201CNobody I recognize. But I will investigate.\u201D\r\nAmaram nodded, falling silent. Behind the two, a group of lighteyed officers entered, one of them carrying the Shardblade, holding it on a pure white cloth. Behind this group came the four surviving members of Kaladin\u2019s squad: Hab, Reesh, Alabet, and Coreb.\r\nKaladin stood up, feeling exhausted. Amaram remained by the door, arms folded, as two final men entered and closed the door. These last two were also lighteyes, but lesser ones\u2014officers in Amaram\u2019s personal guard. Had these been among those who had fled?\r\nIt was the smart thing to do,Kaladin thought.\r\nSmarter than what I did.\r\nAmaram leaned on his walking staff, inspecting Kaladin with bright tan eyes. He\u2019d been in conference with his counselors for several hours now, trying to discover who the Shardbearer had been. \u201CYou did a brave thing today, soldier,\u201D Amaram said to Kaladin.\r\n\u201CI\u2026\u201D What did you say to that?\r\nI wish I\u2019d left you to die, sir.\u201CThank you.\u201D\r\n\u201CEveryone else fled, including my honor guard.\u201D The two men closest to the door looked down, ashamed. \u201CBut you charged in for the attack. Why?\u201D\r\n\u201CI didn\u2019t really think about it, sir.\u201D\r\nAmaram seemed displeased by the answer. \u201CYour name is Kaladin, is it?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes, Brightlord. From Hearthstone? Remember?\u201D\r\nAmaram frowned, looking confused.\r\n\u201CYour cousin, Roshone, is citylord there. He sent my brother into the army when you came recruiting. I\u2026I joined with my brother.\u201D\r\n\u201CAh yes,\u201D Amaram said. \u201CI believe I remember you.\u201D He didn\u2019t ask after Tien. \u201CYou still haven\u2019t answered my question. Why attack? It wasn\u2019t for the Shardblade. You rejected that.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes, sir.\u201D\r\nTo the side, the stormwarden raised his eyebrows, as if he hadn\u2019t believed that Kaladin had turned down the Shards. The soldier holding the Shardblade kept glancing at it in awe.\r\n\u201CWhy?\u201D Amaram said. \u201CWhy did you reject it? I have to know.\u201D\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t want it, sir.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes, but why?\u201D\r\nBecause it would make me one of you. Because I can\u2019t look at that weapon and not see the faces of the men its wielder slaughtered so offhandedly.\r\nBecause\u2026because\u2026\r\n\u201CI can\u2019t really answer that, sir,\u201D Kaladin said, sighing.\r\nThe stormwarden walked over to the room\u2019s brazier, shaking his head. He began warming his hands.\r\n\u201CLook,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CThose Shards are mine. Well, I said to give them to Coreb. He\u2019s the highest ranked of my soldiers, and the best fighter among them.\u201D The other three would understand. Besides, Coreb would take care of them, once he was a lighteyes.\r\nAmaram looked at Coreb, then nodded to his attendants. One closed the window shutters. The others pulled out swords, then began moving toward the four remaining members of Kaladin\u2019s squad.\r\nKaladin yelled, leaping forward, but two of the officers had positioned themselves close to him. One slammed a punch into Kaladin\u2019s gut as soon as he started moving. He was so surprised that it connected directly, and he gasped.\r\nNo.\r\nHe fought off the pain, turning to swing at the man. The man\u2019s eyes opened wide as Kaladin\u2019s fist connected, throwing him backward. Several other men piled on him. He had no weapons, and he was so tired from the battle that he could barely stay upright. They knocked him to the ground with punches to his side and back. He collapsed to the floor, pained, but still able to watch as the soldiers came at his men.\r\nReesh was cut down first. Kaladin gasped, stretching out a hand, struggling to his knees.\r\nThis can\u2019t happen. Please, no!\r\nHab and Alabet had their knives out, but fell quickly, one soldier gutting Hab as two others hacked down Alabet. Alabet\u2019s knife thumped as it hit the ground, followed by his arm, then finally his corpse.\r\nCoreb lasted the longest, backing away, hands held forward. He didn\u2019t scream. He seemed to understand. Kaladin\u2019s eyes were watering, and soldiers grabbed him from behind, stopping him from helping.\r\nCoreb\u2019s fell to his knees and began to beg. One of Amaram\u2019s men took him at the neck, neatly severing his head. It was over in seconds.\r\n\u201CYou bastard!\u201D Kaladin said, gasping against his pain. \u201CYou storming bastard!\u201D Kaladin found himself weeping, struggling uselessly at the four men holding him. The blood of the fallen spearmen soaked the boards.\r\nThey were dead. All of them were dead. Stormfather! All of them!\r\nAmaram stepped forward, expression grim. He went down on one knee before Kaladin. \u201CI\u2019m sorry.\u201D\r\n\u201CBastard!\u201D Kaladin screamed as loud as he could.\r\n\u201CI couldn\u2019t risk them telling what they saw. This is what must be, soldier. It\u2019s for the good of the army. They\u2019re going to be told that your squad helped the Shardbearer. You see, the men must believe that\r\nIkilled him.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou\u2019re taking the Shards for yourself!\u201D\r\n\u201CI am trained in the sword,\u201D Amaram said, \u201Cand am accustomed to plate. It will serve Alethkar best if I bear the Shards.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou could have asked me for them! Storm you!\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd when news got around camp?\u201D Amaram said grimly. \u201CThat you\u2019d killed the Shardbearer but I had the Shards? Nobody would believe that you\u2019d given them up of your own free choice. Besides, son. You wouldn\u2019t have let me keep them.\u201D Amaram shook his head. \u201CYou\u2019d have changed your mind. In a day or two, you\u2019d have wanted the wealth and prestige\u2014others would convince you of it. You\u2019d have\r\ndemandedthat I return them to you. It took hours to decide, but Restares is right\u2014this is what must be done. For the good of Alethkar.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s not about Alethkar! It\u2019s about you! Storm it, you\u2019re supposed to be better than the others!\u201D Tears dripped from Kaladin\u2019s chin.\r\nAmaram looked guilty suddenly, as if he knew what Kaladin had said was true. He turned away, waving to the stormwarden. The man turned from the brazier, holding something he\u2019d been heating in the coals. A small branding iron.\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s all an act?\u201D Kaladin asked. \u201CThe honorable brightlord who cares about his men? Lies? All of it?\u201D\r\n\u201CThis\r\nisfor my men,\u201D Amaram said. He took the Shardblade from the cloth, holding it in his hand. The gemstone at its pommel let out a flash of white light. \u201CYou can\u2019t begin to understand the weights I carry, spearman.\u201D Amaram\u2019s voice lost some of its calm tone of reason. He sounded defensive. \u201CI can\u2019t worry about the lives of a few darkeyed spearmen when thousands of people may be saved by my decision.\u201D\r\nThe stormwarden stepped up to Kaladin, positioning the branding iron. The glyphs, reversed, read sas\r\nnahn. A slave\u2019s brand.\r\n\u201CYou came for me,\u201D Amaram said, limping to the door, stepping around Reesh\u2019s body. \u201CFor saving my life, I spare yours. Five men telling the same story would have been believed, but a single slave will be ignored. The warcamp will be told that you didn\u2019t try to help your fellows\u2014but you didn\u2019t try to stop them, either. You fled and were captured by my guard.\u201D\r\nAmaram hesitated by the door, resting the blunt edge of the stolen Shardblade on his shoulder. The guilt was still there in his eyes, but he grew hard, covering it. \u201CYou are being discharged as a deserter and branded as a slave. But you are spared death by my mercy.\u201D\r\nHe opened the door and walked out.\r\nThe branding iron fell, searing Kaladin\u2019s fate into his skin. He let out a final, ragged scream.\r\nTHE END OF\r\nPart Three"

      "ChapterName": "1-7: BAXIL",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\nBaxil hastened down the lavish palace corridor, clutching the bulky bag of tools. A sound like a footfall came from behind him and he jumped, spinning. He didn\u2019t see anything. The corridor was empty, a golden carpet lining the floor, mirrors on the walls, arched ceiling inlaid with elaborate mosaics.\r\n\u201CWould you\r\nstopthat?\u201D Av said, walking beside him. \u201CEvery time you jump I nearly cuff you one out of surprise.\u201D\r\n\u201CI can\u2019t help it,\u201D Baxil said. \u201CShouldn\u2019t we be doing this at night?\u201D\r\n\u201CMistress knows what she\u2019s doing,\u201D Av said. Like Baxil, Av was Emuli, with dark skin and hair. But the taller man was far more self-confident. He sauntered down the halls, acting as if they\u2019d been invited, thick-bladed sword slung in a sheath over his shoulder.\r\nIf the Prime Kadasix may provide,Baxil thought,\r\nI\u2019d rather Av never have to draw that weapon. Thank you.\r\nTheir mistress walked ahead of them, the only other person in the hallway. She wasn\u2019t Emuli\u2013she didn\u2019t even seem Makabaki, though she had dark skin and long, beautiful black hair. She had eyes like a Shin, but she was tall and lean, like an Alethi. Av thought she was a mixed breed. Or so he said when they dared talk about such things. The mistress had good ears. Strangely good ears.\r\nShe stopped at the next intersection. Baxil caught himself glancing over his shoulder again. Av elbowed him, but he couldn\u2019t help looking. Yes, the mistress claimed that the palace servants would be busy getting the new guest wing ready, but this was the home of Ashno of Sages himself. One of the richest and holiest men in all of Emul. He had hundreds of servants. What if one of them walked down this hallway?\r\nThe two men joined their mistress at the intersection. He forced his eyes forward so he wouldn\u2019t keep looking over his shoulder, but then found himself staring at the mistress. It was dangerous, being employed by a woman as beautiful as she was, with that long black hair, worn free, hanging down to her waist. She never wore a proper woman\u2019s robe, or even a dress or skirt. Always trousers, usually sleek and tight, a thin-bladed sword at her hip. Her eyes were so faintly violet they were almost white.\r\nShe was amazing. Wonderful, intoxicating, overwhelming.\r\nAv elbowed him in the ribs again. Baxil jumped, then glared at his cousin, rubbing his belly.\r\n\u201CBaxil,\u201D the mistress said. \u201CMy tools.\u201D\r\nHe opened the bag, handing over a folded tool belt. It clinked as she took it, not looking at him, then she strode down the hallway to their left.\r\nBaxil watched, uncomfortable. This was the Hallowed Hall, the place where a wealthy man placed images of his Kadasix for reverence. The mistress walked up to the first piece of art. The painting depicted Epan, Lady of Dreams. It was beautiful, a masterpiece of gold leaf on black canvas.\r\nThe mistress took a knife from her bundle and slashed the painting down the front. Baxil cringed, but said nothing. He\u2019d almost gotten used to the casual way she destroyed art, though he was baffled by it. She did pay the two of them very well, however.\r\nAv leaned back against the wall, picking his teeth with a fingernail. Baxil tried to imitate his relaxed pose. The large hallway was lit with topaz chips set in beautiful chandeliers, but they made no move to take them. The mistress did not approve of stealing.\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve been thinking of seeking the Old Magic,\u201D Baxil said, partially to keep himself from cringing as the mistress moved on to gouge out the eyes of a fine bust.\r\nAv snorted. \u201CWhy?\u201D\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know,\u201D Baxil said. \u201CSeems like something to do with myself. I\u2019ve never sought it, you know, and they say every man gets one chance. Ask a boon of the Nightwatcher. Have you used yours?\u201D\r\n\u201CNah,\u201D Av said. \u201CDon\u2019t fancy making the trip all the way to the Valley. Besides, my brother went. Came back with two numb hands. Never could feel anything with them again.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat was his boon?\u201D Baxil asked as the mistress wrapped up a vase with a cloth, then quietly shattered it on the floor and crushed the pieces.\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t know,\u201D Av said. \u201CHe never said. Seemed embarrassed. Probably asked for something silly, like a good haircut.\u201D Av smirked.\r\n\u201CI was thinking I\u2019d make myself more useful,\u201D Baxil said. \u201CAsk for courage, you know?\u201D\r\n\u201CIf you want,\u201D Av replied. \u201CI figure there are better ways than the Old Magic. You never know what kind of curse you\u2019ll end up with.\u201D\r\n\u201CI could phrase my request perfectly,\u201D Baxil said.\r\n\u201CDoesn\u2019t work that way,\u201D Av said. \u201CIt\u2019s not a game, no matter how the stories try to put it. The Nightwatcher doesn\u2019t trick you or twist your words. You ask a boon. She gives what\r\nshefeels you deserve, then gives you a curse to go along with it. Sometimes related, sometimes not.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd you\u2019re an expert?\u201D Baxil asked. The mistress was slashing another painting. \u201CI thought you said you never went.\u201D\r\n\u201CI didn\u2019t,\u201D Av said. \u201COn account of my father going, my mother going, and each of my brothers going. A few got what they wanted. Most all of them regretted the curse, save my father. He got a heap of good cloth; sold to keep us from starving during the lurnip famine a few decades ago.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat was his curse?\u201D Baxil said.\r\n\u201CSaw the world upside down from then on.\u201D\r\n\u201CReally?\u201D\r\n\u201CYeah,\u201D Av said. \u201CTwisted all about. Like people walk on the ceilings and the sky was underneath him. Said he got used to it pretty quickly, though, and didn\u2019t really think it a curse by the time he died.\u201D\r\nEven thinking about that curse made Baxil feel sick. He looked down at his sack of tools. If he weren\u2019t such a coward, would he\u2013maybe\u2013be able to convince the mistress to see him as something more than just hired muscle?\r\nIf the Prime Kadasix could provide,he thought,\r\nit would be very nice if I could know the right thing to do. Thank you.\r\nThe mistress returned, hair somewhat disheveled. She held out a hand. \u201CPadded mallet, Baxil. There\u2019s a full statue back there.\u201D\r\nHe responded, pulling the mallet out of the sack and handing it to her.\r\n\u201CPerhaps I should get myself a Shardblade,\u201D she said absently, putting the tool up on her shoulder. \u201CBut that might make this too easy.\u201D\r\n\u201CI wouldn\u2019t mind if it were too easy, mistress,\u201D Baxil noted.\r\nShe sniffed, walking back down the hallway. Soon she began to pound on a statue at the far end, breaking off its arms. Baxil winced. \u201CSomeone\u2019s\r\ngoingto hear that.\u201D\r\n\u201CYeah,\u201D Av said. \u201CProbably why she waited to do it last.\u201D\r\nAt least the pounding was muffled by the padding. They had to be the only thieves who sneaked into the homes of rich men without taking anything.\r\n\u201CWhy\r\ndoesshe do this, Av?\u201D Baxil found himself asking.\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t know. Maybe you should ask her.\u201D\r\n\u201CI thought you said I should never do that!\u201D\r\n\u201CDepends,\u201D Av said. \u201CHow attached to your limbs are you?\u201D\r\n\u201CRather attached.\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, if you ever want that changed, start asking the mistress prying questions. Until then, shut up.\u201D\r\nBaxil said nothing further.\r\nThe Old Magic,he thought.\r\nItcould\r\nchange me. I will go looking for it.\r\nKnowing his luck, though, he wouldn\u2019t be able to find it. He sighed, resting back against the wall as muted thuds continued to come from the mistress\u2019s direction."

      "ChapterName": "1-8: GERANID",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\n\u201CI\u2019m thinking of changing my Calling,\u201D Ashir said from behind.\r\nGeranid nodded absently as she worked on her equations. The small stone room smelled sharply of spices. Ashir was trying another new experiment. It involved some kind of curry powder and a rare Shin fruit that he\u2019d caramelized. Something like that. She could hear it sizzling on his new fabrial hotplate.\r\n\u201CI\u2019m tired of cooking,\u201D Ashir continued. He had a soft, kindly voice. She loved him for that. Partially because he liked to talk\u2013and if you were going to have someone talk while you were attempting to think, they might as well have a soft, kindly voice.\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t have\r\npassionfor it as I once did,\u201D he continued. \u201CBesides, what good will a cook be in the Spiritual Realm?\u201D\r\n\u201CHeralds need food,\u201D she said absently, scratching out a line on her writing board, then scribbling another line of numbers beneath it.\r\n\u201CDo they?\u201D Ashir asked. \u201CI\u2019ve never been convinced. Oh, I\u2019ve read the speculations, but it just doesn\u2019t seem rational to me. The body must be fed in the Physical Realm, but the spirit exists in a completely different state.\u201D\r\n\u201CA state of ideals,\u201D she replied. \u201CSo, you could create ideal foods, perhaps.\u201D\r\n\u201CHmm\u2026What would be the fun in that? No experimentation.\u201D\r\n\u201CI could do without,\u201D she said, leaning forward to inspect the room\u2019s hearth, where two flamespren danced on the logs\u2019 fire. \u201CIf it meant never again having to eat something like that green soup you made last month.\u201D\r\n\u201CAh,\u201D he said, sounding wistful. \u201CThat was something, wasn\u2019t it? Completely revolting, yet made entirely from appetizing ingredients.\u201D He seemed to consider it a personal triumph. \u201CI wonder if they eat in the Cognitive Realm. Is a food there what it sees itself as being? I\u2019ll have to read and see if anyone has ever eaten while visiting Shadesmar.\u201D\r\nGeranid responded with a noncommittal grunt, getting out her calipers and leaning closer to the heat to measure the flamespren. She frowned, then made another notation.\r\n\u201CHere, love,\u201D Ashir said, walking over, then knelt beside her and offered a small bowl. \u201CGive this a try. I think you\u2019ll like it.\u201D\r\nShe eyed the contents. Bits of bread covered with a red sauce. It was men\u2019s food, but they were both ardents, so that didn\u2019t matter.\r\nFrom outside came the sounds of waves gently lapping against the rocks. They were on a tiny Reshi island, technically sent to provide for the religious needs of any Vorin visitors. Some travelers did come to them for that, occasionally even some of the Reshi. But really, this was a way of getting away and focusing on their experiments. Geranid with her spren studies. Ashir with his chemistry\u2013through cooking, of course, as it allowed him to eat the results.\r\nThe portly man smiled affably, head shaven, grey beard neatly squared off. They both kept to the rules of their stations, despite their seclusion. One did not write the ending of a lifetime of faith with a sloppy last chapter.\r\n\u201CNo green,\u201D she noted, taking the bowl. \u201CThat\u2019s a good sign.\u201D\r\n\u201CHmmm,\u201D he said, leaning down and adjusting his spectacles to inspect her notations. \u201CYes. It really was fascinating the way that Shin vegetable caramelized. I\u2019m so pleased that Gom brought it to me. You\u2019ll have to go over my notes. I think I got the figures right, but I could be wrong.\u201D He wasn\u2019t as strong at mathematics as he was at theory. Conveniently, Geranid was just the opposite.\r\nShe took a spoon and tried the food. She didn\u2019t wear a sleeve on her safehand\u2013another one of the advantages of being an ardent. The food was actually quite good. \u201CDid you\r\ntrythis, Ashir?\u201D\r\n\u201CNope,\u201D he said, still looking over her figures. \u201CYou\u2019re the brave one, my dear.\u201D\r\nShe sniffed. \u201CIt\u2019s terrible.\u201D\r\n\u201CI can see that from how you\u2019re taking another large bite at this moment.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes, but you\u2019d hate it. No fruit. Is this fish you added?\u201D\r\n\u201CA dried handful of the little minnows I caught outside this morning. Still don\u2019t know what species they are. Tasty, though.\u201D He hesitated, then looked up at the hearth and its spren. \u201CGeranid, what\r\nisthis?\u201D\r\n\u201CI think I\u2019ve had a breakthrough,\u201D she said softly.\r\n\u201CBut the figures,\u201D he said, tapping the writing board. \u201CYou said they were erratic, and they still are.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D she said, narrowing her eyes at the flamespren. \u201CBut I can predict when they will be erratic and when they won\u2019t be.\u201D\r\nHe looked at her, frowning.\r\n\u201CThe spren change when I measure them, Ashir,\u201D she said. \u201CBefore I measure, they dance and vary in size, luminosity, and shape. But when I make a notation, they immediately freeze in their current state. Then they remain that way permanently, so far as I can tell.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat does it mean?\u201D he asked.\r\n\u201CI\u2019m hoping you\u2019ll be able to tell me. I have the figures. You\u2019ve got the imagination, dear one.\u201D\r\nHe scratched at his beard, sitting back, and produced a bowl and spoon for himself. He\u2019d sprinkled dried fruit over his portion; Geranid was half convinced he\u2019d joined the ardentia because of his sweet tooth. \u201CWhat happens if you erase the figures?\u201D he asked.\r\n\u201CThe spren go back to being variable,\u201D she said. \u201CLength, shape, luminosity.\u201D\r\nHe took a bite of his mush. \u201CGo into the other room.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat?\u201D\r\n\u201CJust do it. Take your writing board.\u201D\r\nShe sighed, standing up, joints popping. Was she getting\r\nthatold? Starlight, but they\u2019d spent a long time out on this island. She walked to the other room, where their cot was.\r\n\u201CWhat now?\u201D she called.\r\n\u201CI\u2019m going to measure the spren with your calipers,\u201D he called back. \u201CI\u2019ll take three measurements in a row. Only write down one of the figures I give you. Don\u2019t tell me which one you\u2019re writing down.\u201D\r\n\u201CAll right,\u201D she called back. The window was open, and she looked out over a darkening, glassy expanse of water. The Reshi Sea wasn\u2019t as shallow as the Purelake, but it was quite warm most of the time, dotted with tropical islands and the occasional monster of a greatshell.\r\n\u201CThree inches, seven tenths,\u201D Ashir called.\r\nShe didn\u2019t write down the figure.\r\n\u201CTwo inches, eight tenths.\u201D\r\nShe ignored the number this time too, but got her chalk ready to write\u2014as quietly as possible\u2014the next numbers he called out.\r\n\u201CTwo inches, three ten\u2014Wow.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat?\u201D she called.\r\n\u201CIt stopped changing sizes. I assume you wrote down that third number?\u201D\r\nShe frowned, walking back into their small living chamber. Ashir\u2019s hotplate sat on a low table to her right. After the Reshi style, there were no chairs, just cushions, and all the furniture was flat and long, rather than tall.\r\nShe approached the hearth. One of the two flamespren danced about atop a log, shape changing and length flickering like the flames themselves. The other had taken on a far more stable shape. Its length no longer changed, though its form did slightly.\r\nIt seemed\r\nlockedsomehow. It almost looked like a little person as it danced over the fire. She reached up and erased her notation. It immediately began pulsing and changing erratically like the other one.\r\n\u201CWow,\u201D Ashir repeated. \u201CIt\u2019s as if it knows, somehow, that it has been measured. As if merely\r\ndefiningits form traps it somehow. Write down a number.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat number?\u201D\r\n\u201CAny number,\u201D he said. \u201CBut one that might be the size of a flamespren.\u201D\r\nShe did so. Nothing happened.\r\n\u201CYou have to\r\nactuallymeasure it,\u201D he said, tapping his spoon softly against the side of his bowl. \u201CNo pretending.\u201D\r\n\u201CI wonder at the precision of the instrument,\u201D she said. \u201CIf I use one that is less precise, will that give the spren more flexibility? Or is there a threshold, an accuracy beyond which it finds itself bound?\u201D She sat down, feeling daunted. \u201CI need to research this more. Try it for luminosity, then compare that to my general equation of flamespren luminosity as compared to the fire they\u2019re drawn to dance around.\u201D\r\nAshir grimaced. \u201CThat, my dear, sounds a lot like math.\u201D\r\n\u201CIndeed.\u201D\r\n\u201CThen I shall make you a snack to occupy you while you create new marvels of calculation and genius.\u201D He smiled, kissing her forehead. \u201CYou just found something wonderful,\u201D he said more softly. \u201CI don\u2019t know what it means yet, but it might very well change everything we understand about spren. And maybe even about fabrials.\u201D\r\nShe smiled, turning back to her equations. And for once, she didn\u2019t mind at all as he began chatting about his ingredients, working out a new formula for some sugary confection he was\r\nsureshe\u2019d love."

      "ChapterName": "1-9: DEATH WEARS WHITE",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\nSzeth-son-son-Vallano, Truthless of Shinovar, spun between the two guards as their eyes burned out. They slumped quietly to the floor.\r\nWith three quick strokes, he slashed his Shardblade through the hinges and latch of the grand door. Then he took a deep breath, absorbing the Stormlight from a pouch of gemstones at his waist. He burst alight with renewed power and kicked the door with the force of a Light-enhanced foot.\r\nIt flew backward into the room, hinges no longer holding it in place, then crashed to the floor, skidding on the stone. The large feast hall inside was filled with people, crackling hearths, and clattering plates. The heavy door slid to a halt, and the room grew quiet.\r\nI am sorry,he thought. Then he dashed in to start the slaughter.\r\nChaos ensued. Screams, yells, panic. Szeth leaped atop the nearest dining table and started spinning, cutting down everyone nearby. As he did so, he made certain to listen to the sounds of the dying. He did not shut his ears to the screams. He did not ignore the wails of pain. He paid attention to each and every one.\r\nAnd hated himself.\r\nHe moved forward, leaping from table to table, wielding his Shardblade, a god of burning Stormlight and death.\r\n\u201CArmsmen!\u201D yelled the lighteyed man at the edge of the room. \u201CWhere are my armsmen!\u201D Thick of waist and shoulder, the man had a square brown beard and a prominent nose. King Hanavanar of Jah Keved. Not a Shardbearer, though some rumors said that he secretly kept a Shardblade.\r\nNear Szeth, men and women scrambled away, stumbling over one another. He dropped among them, his white clothing rippling. He cut through a man who was drawing his sword\u2013but also sliced through three women who wanted only to escape. Eyes burned and bodies collapsed.\r\nSzeth reached behind himself, infusing the table he\u2019d leaped from, then Lashing it to the far wall with a Basic Lashing, the type that changed which direction was down. The large wooden table fell to the side, tumbling into people, causing more screams and more pain.\r\nSzeth found himself crying. His orders were simple. Kill. Kill as you have never killed before. Lay the innocent screaming at your feet and make the lighteyes weep. Do so wearing white, so all know who you are. Szeth did not object. It was not his place. He was Truthless.\r\nAnd he did as his masters demanded.\r\nThree lighteyed men got up the nerve to attack him, and Szeth raised his Shardblade in salute. They screamed battle cries as they charged. He was silent. A flick of his wrist cut the blade from the first one\u2019s sword. The length of metal spun in the air as Szeth stepped between the other two, his Blade swishing through their necks. They dropped in tandem, eyes shriveling. Szeth struck the first man from behind, ramming the Blade through his back and out his chest.\r\nThe man dropped forward\u2013a hole in his shirt, but his skin unmarred. As he hit the floor, his severed sword blade clanged to the stones beside him.\r\nAnother group came at Szeth from the side, and he drew Stormlight into his hand and flung it in a Full Lashing across the floor at their feet. This was the Lashing that bonded objects; when the men crossed it, their shoes stuck to the floor. They tripped, and found their hands and bodies Lashed to the floor as well. Szeth stepped through them mournfully, striking.\r\nThe king edged away, as if to round the chamber and escape. Szeth sprayed a table\u2019s top with a Full Lashing, then infused the entire thing with a Basic Lashing as well, pointed at the doorway. The table flipped into the air and crashed against the exit\u2013the side bearing the Full Lashing sticking it to the wall. People tried to pry it out of the way, but that only made them bunch up as Szeth waded into them, Shardblade sweeping.\r\nSo many deaths. Why? What purpose did it fulfill?\r\nWhen he\u2019d assaulted Alethkar six years before, he\u2019d thought that had been a massacre. He hadn\u2019t known what a true massacre was. He reached the door and found himself standing over the bodies of some thirty people, his emotions caught up in the tempest of Stormlight within him. He hated that Stormlight, suddenly, as much as he hated himself. As much as the cursed Blade he held.\r\nAnd\u2026and the king. Szeth spun on the man. Irrationally, his confused, broken mind blamed this man. Why had he called a feast on this night? Why couldn\u2019t he have retired early? Why had he invited so many people?\r\nSzeth charged at the king. He passed the dead, who lay twisted on the floor, burned-out eyes staring in lifeless accusation. The king cowered behind his high table.\r\nThat high table shuddered, quivering oddly.\r\nSomething was wrong.\r\nInstinctively, Szeth Lashed himself to the ceiling. From his viewpoint, the room flipped, and the floor was now the ceiling. Two figures burst out from beneath the king\u2019s table. Two men in Plate, carrying Shardblades, swinging.\r\nTwisting in the air, Szeth evaded their swings, then Lashed himself back to the floor, landing on the king\u2019s table just as the king summoned a Shardblade. So the rumors were true.\r\nThe king struck, but Szeth jumped backward, landing beyond the Shardbearers. Outside, he could hear footfalls. Szeth glanced to see men pouring into the room. The newcomers carried distinctive, diamond-shaped shields. Half-shards. Szeth had heard of the new fabrials, capable of stopping a Shardblade.\r\n\u201CYou think I didn\u2019t know you were coming?\u201D the king yelled at him. \u201CAfter you killed three of my highprinces? We\u2019re ready for you, assassin.\u201D He lifted something from beneath the table. Another of those half-shard shields. They were made of metal imbedded with a gemstone hidden at the back.\r\n\u201CYou are a fool,\u201D Szeth said, Stormlight leaking from his mouth.\r\n\u201CWhy?\u201D the king called. \u201CYou think I should have run?\u201D\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D Szeth replied, meeting his eyes. \u201CBecause you set a trap for me during a feast. And now I can blame you for their deaths.\u201D\r\nThe soldiers fanned out through the room while the two fully armored Shardbearers stepped toward him, Blades out. The king smiled.\r\n\u201CSo let it be,\u201D Szeth said, breathing deeply, sucking in the Stormlight of the many gemstones tied in the pouches at his waist. The Light began to rage within him, like a highstorm in his chest, burning and screaming. He breathed in more than he\u2019d ever held before, holding it until he was barely able to keep the Stormlight from ripping him apart.\r\nWere those still tears in his eyes? Would that they could hide his crimes. He yanked the strap free at his waist, releasing his belt and the heavy spheres.\r\nThen he dropped his Shardblade.\r\nHis opponents froze in shock as his Blade vanished to mist. Who would drop a Shardblade in the middle of a battle? It defied reason.\r\nAnd so did Szeth.\r\nYou are a work of art, Szeth-son-Neturo. A god.\r\nIt was time to see.\r\nThe soldiers and Shardbearers charged. Mere heartbeats before they reached him, Szeth spun into motion, liquid tempest in his veins. He dodged between the initial sword strikes, spinning into the midst of the soldiers. Holding this much Stormlight made it easier to infuse things; the light wanted out, and it pushed against his skin. In this state, the Shardblade would only be a distraction. Szeth himself was the real weapon.\r\nHe grabbed the arm of an attacking soldier. It took only an instant to infuse and Lash him upward. The man cried out, falling into the air as Szeth ducked another sword thrust. He touched the attacker\u2019s leg, inhumanly lithe. With a look and a blink, he Lashed that man to the ceiling as well.\r\nSoldiers cursed, slashing at him, their bulky half-shards suddenly becoming hindrances as Szeth moved among them, graceful as a skyeel, touching arms, legs, shoulders, sending a dozen, then two dozen, men flying in all directions. Most went up, but he sent a barrage of them toward the approaching Shardbearers, who cried out as squirming bodies smashed into them.\r\nHe jumped backward as a squad of soldiers came at him, Lashing himself to the far wall and spinning into the air. The room changed orientations, and he landed on the wall\u2013which was now down for him. He ran along it toward the king, who waited behind his Shardbearers.\r\n\u201CKill him!\u201D the king said. \u201CStorm you all! What are you doing? Kill him!\u201D\r\nSzeth leaped off the wall, Lashing himself downward as he flipped, landing with one knee on the dining table. Silverware and plates clinked as he grabbed a dining knife and infused once, twice, three times. He used a triple Basic Lashing, pointing it in the direction of the king, then dropped it and Lashed himself backward.\r\nHe lurched away as one of the Shardbearers struck, cutting the table in half. Szeth\u2019s released knife fell far more quickly than it should have, flashing toward the king. He barely got his shield up in time, eyes wide as the knife clanged against the metal.\r\nDamnation,Szeth thought, Lashing himself upward with a quarter of a Basic Lashing. That didn\u2019t pull him upward, it just made him much lighter. A quarter of his weight was now pulled upward instead of downward. In essence, he became half as heavy as he had been.\r\nHe twisted, white clothing flapping gracefully as he dropped amid the common soldiers. Soldiers he\u2019d Lashed earlier began to fall from the high ceiling, their Stormlight running out. A rain of broken bodies, crashing one by one to the floor.\r\nSzeth came at the soldiers again. Some men fell as he sent others flying. Their expensive shields clanged to the stones, falling from dead or stunned fingers. Soldiers tried to reach him, but Szeth danced between them, using the ancient martial art of kammar, which used only the hands. It was meant as a less deadly form of fighting, focused on grabbing enemies and using their weight against them, immobilizing them.\r\nIt was also ideal when one wanted to touch and infuse someone.\r\nHe was the storm. He was destruction. At his will, men flipped into the air, fell, and died. He swept outward, touching a table and Lashing it upward with half a Basic Lashing. With half its mass pulled upward, half downward, it became weightless. Szeth sprayed it with a Full Lashing, then kicked it toward the soldiers; they stuck to it, their clothing and skin bonding to the wood.\r\nA Shardblade hissed through the air beside him, and Szeth exhaled lightly, Stormlight rising from his lips as he ducked out of the way. The two Shardbearers attacked as bodies fell from above, but Szeth was too quick, too limber. The Shardbearers didn\u2019t work together. They were accustomed to dominating a battlefield or dueling with a single enemy. Their powerful weapons made them sloppy.\r\nSzeth ran on light feet, held to the ground only half as much as other men. He easily leaped another swipe, Lashing himself to the ceiling to give himself just a little more lift before quarter-Lashing to make himself weighted down again. The result was an effortless leap of ten feet into the air.\r\nThe missed swing hit the ground and cut through the belt he\u2019d dropped earlier, opening one of his large pouches. Spheres and bare gemstones sprayed across the floor. Some infused. Some dun. Szeth pulled Stormlight from those that rolled close.\r\nBehind the Shardbearers, the king himself approached, weapon ready. He should have tried to run.\r\nThe two Shardbearers swung their oversized Blades at Szeth. He spun away from the attacks, reaching out and snatching a shield from the air as it tumbled toward the ground. The man who had been holding it crashed to the floor a second later.\r\nSzeth leaped at one of the Shardbearers\u2013a man in gold armor\u2013deflecting his weapon with the shield and pushing past him. The other man, whose Plate was red, swung too. Szeth caught the Blade on his shield, which cracked, barely holding. Still pushing it against the Blade, Szeth Lashed himself behind the Shardbearer while jumping forward.\r\nThe move flipped Szeth up and over the man. Szeth went on, falling toward the far wall as the second wave of soldiers began to drop to the floor. One crashed into the Shardbearer in red, making him stumble.\r\nSzeth hit the wall, landing against the stones. He was so full of Stormlight. So much power, so much life, so much terrible, terrible destruction.\r\nStone. It was sacred. He never thought about that anymore. How could anything be sacred to him, now?\r\nAs bodies crashed into the Shardbearers, he knelt and placed his hand on a large stone in the wall before him, infusing it. He Lashed it time and time again in the direction of the Shardbearers. Once, twice, ten times, fifteen times. He kept pouring Stormlight into it. It glowed brightly. Mortar cracked. Stone ground against stone.\r\nThe red Shardbearer turned just as the massive, infused rock fell toward him, moving with twenty times the normal acceleration of a falling stone. It crashed into him, shattering his breastplate, spraying molten bits in all directions. The block hurled him across the room, crushing him against the far wall. He did not move.\r\nSzeth was nearly out of Stormlight now. He quarter-Lashed himself to reduce his weight, then loped across the ground. Men were crushed, broken, dead around him. Spheres rolled on the floor, and he drew in their Stormlight. The Light streamed up, like the souls of those he had killed, infusing him.\r\nHe began to run. The other Shardbearer stumbled backward, holding up his Blade, stepping onto the wood of a shattered tabletop, the legs of which had broken free. The king finally realized his trap was failing. He started to flee.\r\nTen heartbeats, Szeth thought.\r\nReturn to me, you creation of Damnation.\r\nSzeth\u2019s heartbeats began to thump in his ears. He screamed\u2013Light bursting from his mouth like radiant smoke\u2013and threw himself to the ground as the Shardbearer swung. Szeth Lashed himself toward the far wall, skidding through the Shardbearer\u2019s legs. He immediately Lashed himself upward.\r\nHe soared into the air as the Shardbearer rounded on him again. But Szeth wasn\u2019t there. He Lashed himself back downward, dropping behind the Shardbearer to land on the broken tabletop. He stooped and infused it. A man in Shardplate might be protected from Lashings, but the things he stood upon were not.\r\nSzeth Lashed the plank upward with a multiple Lashing. It lurched into the air, tossing aside the Shardbearer like a toy soldier. Szeth himself stayed atop the board, riding it upward in a rush of air. As it reached the lofty ceiling he threw himself off, Lashing himself downward once, twice, three times.\r\nThe tabletop crashed to the ceiling. Szeth fell with incredible speed toward the Shardbearer, who lay dazed on his back.\r\nSzeth\u2019s Blade formed in his fingers just as he hit, driving the weapon down through Shardplate. The breastplate exploded and the Blade sank deeply through the man\u2019s chest and into the floor underneath.\r\nSzeth stood, pulling his Shardblade free. The fleeing king looked over his shoulder with a cry of disbelieving horror. Both of his Shardbearers had fallen in a matter of seconds. The last of the soldiers nervously moved in to protect his retreat.\r\nSzeth had stopped crying. It seemed like he couldn\u2019t cry any longer. He felt numb. His mind\u2026it just couldn\u2019t think. He hated the king. Hated him so badly. And it hurt, physically hurt him, how strong that irrational hatred was.\r\nStormlight rising from him, he Lashed himself toward the king.\r\nHe fell, feet just above the ground, as if he were floating. His clothing rippled. To those guards still alive, he would seem to be gliding across the ground.\r\nHe Lashed himself downward at a slight angle and began to swing his Blade as he reached the ranks of the soldiers. He ran through them as if he were moving down a steep slope. Swirling and spinning, he dropped a dozen men, graceful and terrible, drawing in more Stormlight from spheres that had been scattered on the floor.\r\nSzeth reached the doorway, men with burning eyes falling to the ground behind him. Just outside, the king ran amid a final small group of guards. He turned and cried out as he saw Szeth, then threw up his half-shard shield.\r\nSzeth wove through the guards, then hit the shield twice, shattering it and forcing the king backward. The man tripped, dropping his Blade. It puffed away to mist.\r\nSzeth leaped up and Lashed himself downward with a double Basic Lashing. He hit atop the king, his increased weight breaking an arm and pinning the man to the ground. Szeth swept his blade through the surprised soldiers, who fell as their legs died beneath them.\r\nFinally, Szeth raised his Blade over his head, looking down at the king.\r\n\u201CWhat are you?\u201D the man whispered, eyes watering with pain.\r\n\u201CDeath,\u201D Szeth said, then drove his Blade point-first through the man\u2019s face and into the rock below."

Subject: an out-of-work Veden sailor.\r\n\u201CFather,\u201D Adolin said, pacing in Dalinar\u2019s sitting room. \u201CThis is\r\ninsane.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat is appropriate,\u201D Dalinar replied dryly. \u201CAs\u2014it appears\u2014I am as well.\u201D\r\n\u201CI never claimed you were insane.\u201D\r\n\u201CActually,\u201D Renarin noted, \u201CI believe that you did.\u201D\r\nAdolin glanced at his brother. Renarin stood beside the hearth, inspecting the new fabrial that had been installed there just a few days ago. The infused ruby, encased in a metal enclosure, glowed softly and gave off a comfortable heat. It was convenient, though it felt wrong to Adolin that no fire lay crackling there.\r\nThe three were alone in Dalinar\u2019s sitting room, awaiting the advent of the day\u2019s highstorm. It had been one week since Dalinar had informed his sons of his intention to step down as highprince.\r\nAdolin\u2019s father sat in one of his large, high-backed chairs, hands laced before him, stoic. The warcamps didn\u2019t know of his decision yet\u2014bless the Heralds\u2014but he intended to make the announcement soon. Perhaps at tonight\u2019s feast.\r\n\u201CAll right, fine,\u201D Adolin said. \u201CPerhaps I said it. But I didn\u2019t mean it. Or at least I didn\u2019t mean for it to have this effect on you.\u201D\r\n\u201CWe had this discussion a week ago, Adolin,\u201D Dalinar said softly.\r\n\u201CYes, and you promised to think over your decision!\u201D\r\n\u201CI have. My resolve has not wavered.\u201D\r\nAdolin continued to pace; Renarin stood up straight, watching him as he stalked past.\r\nI\u2019m a fool, Adolin thought.\r\nOfcourse\r\nthis is what Father would do. I should have seen it.\r\n\u201CLook,\u201D Adolin said, \u201Cjust because you might have some problems doesn\u2019t mean you have to abdicate.\u201D\r\n\u201CAdolin, our enemies will use my weakness against us. In fact, you believe that they are\r\nalreadydoing so. If I don\u2019t give up the princedom now, matters could grow much worse than they are now.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut I don\u2019t\r\nwantto be highprince,\u201D Adolin complained. \u201CNot yet, at least.\u201D\r\n\u201CLeadership is rarely about what we want, son. I think too few among the Alethi elite realize that fact.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd what will happen to you?\u201D Adolin asked, pained. He stopped and looked toward his father.\r\nDalinar was so\r\nfirm, even sitting there, contemplating his own madness. Hands clasped before him, wearing a stiff blue uniform with a coat of Kholin blue, silver hair dusting his temples. Those hands of his were thick and callused, his expression determined. Dalinar made a decision and stuck to it, not wavering or debating.\r\nMad or not, he was what Alethkar needed. And Adolin had\u2014in his haste\u2014done what no warrior on the battlefield had ever been able to do: chop Dalinar Kholin\u2019s legs out from under him and send him away in defeat.\r\nOh, Stormfather,Adolin thought, stomach twisting in pain.\r\nJezerezeh, Kelek, and Ishi, Heralds above. Let me find a way to right this. Please.\r\n\u201CI will return to Alethkar,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CThough I hate to leave our army here down a Shardbearer. Could I\u2026but no, I could not give them up.\u201D\r\n\u201COf course not!\u201D Adolin said, aghast. A Shardbearer, giving up his Shards? It almost never happened unless the Bearer was too weak and sickly to use them.\r\nDalinar nodded. \u201CI have long worried that our homeland is in danger, now that every single Shardbearer fights out here on the Plains. Well, perhaps this change of winds is a blessing. I will return to Kholinar and aid the queen, make myself useful fighting against border incursions. Perhaps the Reshi and the Vedens will be less likely to strike against us if they know that they\u2019d be facing a full Shardbearer.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s possible,\u201D Adolin said. \u201CBut they could also escalate and start sending a Shardbearer of their own on raids.\u201D\r\nThat seemed to worry his father. Jah Keved was the only other kingdom in Roshar that owned a substantial number of Shards, nearly as many as Alethkar. There hadn\u2019t been a direct war between them in centuries. Alethkar had been too divided, and Jah Keved was little better. But if the two kingdoms clashed in force, it would be a war the like of which hadn\u2019t been seen since the days of the Hierocracy.\r\nDistant thunder rumbled outside, and Adolin turned sharply toward Dalinar. His father remained in his chair, staring westward, away from the storm. \u201CWe will continue this discussion afterward,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CFor now, you two should tie my arms to the chair.\u201D\r\nAdolin grimaced, but did as he was told without complaint.\r\nDalinar blinked, looking around. He was on the battlement of a single-walled fortress. Crafted from large blocks of deep red stone, the wall was sheer and straight. It was built across a rift in the leeward side of a tall rock formation overlooking an open plain of stone, like a wet leaf stuck across a crack in a boulder.\r\nThese visions feel so real,Dalinar thought, glancing at the spear he held in his hand and then down at his antiquated uniform: a cloth skirt and leather jerkin. It was hard to remember that he was really sitting in his chair, arms tied down. He couldn\u2019t feel the ropes or hear the highstorm.\r\nHe considered waiting out the vision, doing nothing. If this wasn\u2019t real, why should he participate? Yet he didn\u2019t completely believe\u2014\r\ncouldn\u2019tcompletely believe\u2014that he was coming up with these delusions on his own. His decision to abdicate to Adolin was motivated by his doubts. Was he mad? Was he misinterpreting? At the very least, he could no longer trust himself. He didn\u2019t know what was real and what wasn\u2019t. In such a situation a man should step down from his authority and sort things through.\r\nEither way, he felt he needed to\r\nlivethese visions, not ignore them. A desperate piece of him still hoped to come to a solution before he had to abdicate formally. He didn\u2019t let that piece gain too much control\u2014a man had to do what was right. But Dalinar would give it this much: He would treat the vision as real while he was part of it. If there were secrets to be found here, only by playing along would he find them.\r\nHe looked about him. What was he being shown this time, and why? The spearhead on his weapon was of good steel, though his cap appeared to be bronze. One of the six men with him on the wall wore a breastplate of bronze; two others had poorly patched leather uniforms, sliced and resewn with wide stitches.\r\nThe other men lounged about, idly looking out over the wall.\r\nGuard duty,Dalinar thought, stepping up and scanning the landscape outside. This rock formation was at the end of an enormous plain\u2014the perfect situation for a fortress. No army could approach without being seen long before its arrival.\r\nThe air was cold enough that clumps of ice clung to the stone in shadowed corners. The sunlight did little to dispel the cold, and the weather explained the lack of grass; the blades would be retracted into their holes, awaiting the relief of spring weather.\r\nDalinar pulled his cloak closer, prompting one of his companions to do the same.\r\n\u201CStorming weather,\u201D the man muttered. \u201CHow long\u2019s it going to last? Been eight weeks already.\u201D\r\nEight weeks? Forty days of winter at once? That was rare. Despite the cold, the other three soldiers looked anything but engaged by their guard duties. One was even dozing.\r\n\u201CStay alert,\u201D Dalinar chided them.\r\nThey glanced at him, the one who had been dozing blinking awake. All three seemed incredulous. One\u2014a tall, red-haired man\u2014scowled. \u201CThis from you, Leef?\u201D\r\nDalinar bit back a retort. Who did they see him as?\r\nThe chill air made his breath steam, and from behind him he could hear metal clanging as men worked at forges and anvils below. The gates to the fortress were closed, and the archer towers were manned to the left and right. They were at war, but guard duty was always boring work. It took well trained soldiers to remain alert for hours on end. Perhaps that was why there were so many soldiers here; if the quality of eyes watching could not be assured, then quantity would serve.\r\nHowever, Dalinar had an advantage. The visions never showed him episodes of idle peace; they threw him into times of conflict and change. Turning points. So it was that, despite dozens of other eyes watching, he was the first to spot it.\r\n\u201CThere!\u201D he said, leaning out over the side of the roughstone crenellation. \u201CWhat is that?\u201D\r\nThe redheaded man raised a hand, shading his eyes. \u201CNothing. A shadow.\u201D\r\n\u201CNo, it\u2019s moving,\u201D said one of the others. \u201CLooks like people. Marching.\u201D\r\nDalinar\u2019s heart began to thump in anticipation as the red-haired man called the alert. More archers rushed onto the battlement, stringing bows. Soldiers gathered in the ruddy courtyard below. Everything was made of that same red rock, and Dalinar caught one of the men referring to this place as \u201CFeverstone Keep.\u201D He\u2019d never heard of it.\r\nScouts galloped from the keep on horses. Why didn\u2019t they have outriders already?\r\n\u201CIt has to be the rear defense force,\u201D one soldier muttered. \u201CThey can\u2019t have gotten through our lines. Not with the Radiants fighting\u2026.\u201D\r\nRadiants? Dalinar stepped closer to listen, but the man gave him a scowl and turned away. Whoever Dalinar was, the others didn\u2019t much care for him.\r\nApparently, this keep was a fallback position behind the front lines of a war. So either that approaching force was friendly, or the enemy had punched through and sent an advance element to besiege the keep. These were reserves, then, which was probably why they had been left with a few horses. They still should have had outriders.\r\nWhen the scouts finally did gallop back to the keep, they bore white flags. Dalinar glanced at his companions, confirming his suspicions as they relaxed. White meant friends. Yet would he have been sent here if it were that simple? If it\r\nwasjust in his mind, would it fabricate a simple, boring vision when it never had before?\r\n\u201CWe need to be alert for a trap,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CSomeone find out what those scouts saw. Did they identify banners only, or did they get a close look?\u201D\r\nThe other soldiers\u2014including some of the archers who now filled the wall top\u2014gave him strange looks. Dalinar cursed softly, glancing back out at the shadowy oncoming force. He had a foreboding itch in the back of his skull. Ignoring the odd looks, he hefted his spear and ran down the walkway of the wall top, reaching a set of stairs. They were built in switchbacks, running in zigzags straight down the tall wall, with no railing. He\u2019d been on such fortifications before, and knew how to keep his eyes focused on the steps to avoid vertigo.\r\nHe reached the bottom and\u2014spear resting on his shoulder\u2014struck out to find someone in charge. The buildings of Feverstone Keep were blocky and utilitarian, built up against one another along the rock walls of the natural rift. Most had square raincatchers on top. With good food stores\u2014or, if lucky, a Soulcaster\u2014such a fortification could withstand a siege for years.\r\nHe couldn\u2019t read the rank insignias, but he could recognize an officer when he saw one standing in a blood-red cloak with a group of honor guards. He had no mail, just a shiny bronze breastplate over leather, and was conferring with one of the scouts. Dalinar hurried up.\r\nOnly then did he see that the man\u2019s eyes were dark brown. That gave Dalinar a shock of incredulity. Those around him treated the man like a brightlord.\r\n\u201C\u2026the Order of the Stonewards, my lord,\u201D the still-mounted scout was saying. \u201CAnd a large number of Windrunners. All on foot.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut why?\u201D the darkeyed officer demanded. \u201CWhy are Radiants coming here? They should be fighting the devils on the front lines!\u201D\r\n\u201CMy lord,\u201D the scout said, \u201Cour orders were to return as soon as we identified them.\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, go back and find out why they\u2019re here!\u201D the officer bellowed, causing the scout to flinch, then turn to ride away.\r\nThe Radiants. They were usually connected to Dalinar\u2019s visions in one way or another. As the officer began to call commands to his attendants, telling them to prep empty bunkers for the knights, Dalinar followed the scout toward the wall. Men crowded near the kill slits there, peering out at the plain. Like those above, these wore motley uniforms that looked pieced together. They weren\u2019t a ragged bunch, but were obviously wearing secondhand leavings.\r\nThe scout rode through a sally port as Dalinar entered the shadow of the enormous wall, walking up to the back of a crowd of soldiers. \u201CWhat is it?\u201D he asked.\r\n\u201CThe Radiants,\u201D one of the men said. \u201CThey\u2019ve broken into a run.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s almost like they\u2019re going to attack,\u201D said another. He chuckled at how ridiculous that sounded, though there was an edge of uncertainty to his voice.\r\nWhat?Dalinar thought, anxious. \u201CLet me through.\u201D\r\nSurprisingly, the men parted. As Dalinar pushed by, he could sense their confusion. He\u2019d given the command with the authority of a highprince and a lighteyes, and they\u2019d obeyed instinctively. Now that they saw him, they were uncertain. What was this simple guardsman doing ordering them about?\r\nHe didn\u2019t give them a chance to question him. He climbed onto the platform against the wall, where a rectangular kill slit looked through the wall and onto the plain. It was too small for a man to get through, but wide enough for archers to fire out. Through it, Dalinar saw that the approaching soldiers had formed a distinct line. Men and women in gleaming Shardplate charged forward. The scout pulled to a halt, looking at the charging Shardbearers. They ran shoulder to shoulder, not a single one of place. Like a crystalline wave. As they drew closer, Dalinar could see that their Plate was unpainted, but it glowed either blue or amber at the joints and across glyphs at the front, as with other Radiants he\u2019d seen in his visions.\r\n\u201CThey don\u2019t have their Shardblades out,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CThat\u2019s a good sign.\u201D\r\nThe scout outside backed his horse up. There looked to be a good two hundred Shardbearers out there. Alethkar owned some twenty Blades, Jah Keved a similar number. If one added up all the rest in the world, there might be enough total to equal the two powerful Vorin kingdoms. That meant, so far as he knew, there were less than hundred Blades in all of the world. And here he saw\r\ntwo hundredShardbearers gathered in one army. It was mind-numbing.\r\nThe Radiants slowed, falling into a trot, then a walk. The soldiers around Dalinar grew still. The leading Radiants stopped in a line, immobile. Suddenly, others began to fall from the sky. They hit with the sound of rock cracking, puffs of Stormlight blossoming from their figures. These all glowed blue.\r\nSoon, there were some three hundred Radiants out on the field. They began summoning their Blades. The weapons appeared in their hands, like fog forming and condensing. It was done in silence. Their visors were down.\r\n\u201CIf them charging without swords was a good sign,\u201D whispered one of the men beside Dalinar, \u201Cthen what does this mean?\u201D\r\nA suspicion began to rise within Dalinar, the horror that he might know what this vision was about to show him. The scout, at last unnerved, turned his horse and galloped back to the keep, screaming for the door to be opened to him. As if a little wood and stone would be a protection against hundreds of Shardbearers. A single man with Plate and Blade was almost an army unto himself, and that wasn\u2019t accounting for the strange powers these people had.\r\nThe soldiers pulled the sally port open for the scout. Making a snap decision, Dalinar leaped down and charged to the opening. Behind, the officer Dalinar had seen earlier was clearing a path for himself to walk up to the kill slit.\r\nDalinar reached the open door, darting through it just after the scout charged back into the courtyard. Men called after Dalinar, terrified. He ignored them, running out onto the open plain. The expansive, straight wall stretched above him, like a highway up to the sun itself. The Radiants were still distant, though they\u2019d stopped within bowshot. Transfixed by the beautiful figures, Dalinar slowed, then stopped about a hundred feet away.\r\nOne knight stepped ahead of his companions, his brilliant cape a rich blue. His Shardblade of rippling steel had intricate carvings along the center. He held it toward the keep for a moment.\r\nThen he drove it point-first into the stone plain. Dalinar blinked. The Shardbearer removed his helm, exposing a handsome head with blond hair and pale skin, light as that of a man from Shinovar. He tossed the helm to the ground beside his blade. It rolled slightly as the Shardbearer made fists in his gauntlets, arms at his sides. He opened his palms wide, and the gauntlets fell free to the rocky ground.\r\nHe turned, his Shardplate falling off his body\u2014breastplate dropping free, greaves slipping off. Underneath, he wore a rumpled blue uniform. He stepped free of his bootlike sabatons and continued to walk away, Shardplate and Shardblade\u2014the most precious treasures any man could own\u2014tossed to the ground and abandoned like refuse.\r\nThe others began to follow suit. Hundreds of men and women, driving Shardblades into the stone and then removing their Plate. The sound of metal hitting stone came like rain. Then like thunder.\r\nDalinar found himself running forward. The door behind him opened and some curious soldiers left the keep. Dalinar reached the Shardblades. They sprouted from the rock like glittering silver trees, a forest of weapons. They glowed softly in a way his own Shardblade never had, but as he dashed among them, their light started to fade.\r\nA terrible feeling struck him. A sense of immense tragedy, of pain and betrayal. Stopping where he stood, he gasped, hand to his chest. What was happening? What\r\nwasthat dreadful feeling, that screaming he swore he could almost hear?\r\nThe Radiants. They walked away from their discarded weapons. They all seemed individuals now, each walking alone despite the crowd. Dalinar charged after them, tripping over discarded breastplates and chunks of armor. He finally stumbled free of it all.\r\n\u201CWait!\u201D he called.\r\nNone of them turned.\r\nHe could now see others in the distance, far off. A crowd of soldiers, not wearing Shardplate, waiting for the Radiants to return. Who were they, and why hadn\u2019t they come forward? Dalinar He caught up to the Radiants\u2014they weren\u2019t walking very quickly\u2014and grabbed one by the arm. The man turned; his skin was tan and his hair dark, like an Alethi. His eyes were of the palest blue. Unnaturally so, in fact\u2014the irises were nearly white.\r\n\u201CPlease,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CTell me why you are doing this.\u201D\r\nThe former Shardbearer pulled his arm free and continued to walk away. Dalinar cursed, then ran into the midst of the Shardbearers. They were of all races and nationalities, dark skin and light, some with white Thaylen eyebrows, others with the skin ripples of the Selay. They walked with eyes forward, not speaking to one another, steps slow but resolute.\r\n\u201CWill someone tell me why?\u201D Dalinar bellowed. \u201CThis is it, isn\u2019t it? The Day of Recreance, the day you betrayed mankind. But why?\u201D None of them spoke. It was as if he didn\u2019t exist.\r\nPeople spoke of betrayal, of the day the Knights Radiant turned their backs on their fellow men. What were they fighting, and why had they stopped?\r\nTwo orders of knights were mentioned,Dalinar thought.\r\nBut there were ten orders. What of the other eight?\r\nDalinar fell to his knees in the sea of solemn individuals. \u201CPlease. I must know.\u201D Nearby, some of the keep\u2019s soldiers had reached the Shardblades\u2014but rather than chasing after the Radiants, these men were cautiously pulling the Blades free. A few officers scrambled out of the keep, calling for the Blades to be put down. They were soon outnumbered by men who began boiling out of side gates and rushing toward the weapons.\r\n\u201CThey are the first,\u201D a voice said.\r\nDalinar looked up to see that one of the knights had stopped beside him. It was the man who looked Alethi. He looked over his shoulder at the crowd gathering around the blades. Men had begun to scream at one another, everyone scrambling to get a Blade before they were all claimed.\r\n\u201CThey are the first,\u201D the Radiant said, turning to Dalinar. Dalinar recognized the depth of that voice. It was the voice that always spoke to him in these visions. \u201CThey were the first, and they were also the last.\u201D\r\n\u201CIs this the Day of Recreance?\u201D Dalinar asked.\r\n\u201CThese events will go down in history,\u201D the Radiant said. \u201CThey will be infamous. You will have many names for what happened here.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut why?\u201D Dalinar asked. \u201CPlease. Why did they abandon their duty?\u201D\r\nThe figure seemed to study him. \u201CI have said I that cannot be of much help to you. The Night of Sorrows will come, and the True Desolation. The Everstorm.\u201D\r\n\u201CThen answer my questions!\u201D Dalinar said.\r\n\u201CRead the book. Unite them.\u201D\r\n\u201CThe book?\r\nThe Way of Kings?\u201D\r\nThe figure turned and walked from him, joining the other Radiants as they crossed the stone plain, walking toward places unknown.\r\nDalinar looked back at the melee of soldiers rushing for Blades. Many had already been claimed. There weren\u2019t enough Blades for everyone, and some had begun raising theirs up, using them to fend off those who got too close. As he watched, a bellowing officer with a Blade was attacked by two men behind him.\r\nThe glow from within the weapons had completely vanished.\r\nThe killing of that officer made others bold. Other skirmishes started, men scrambling to attack those who had Blades, hoping to get one. Eyes began to burn. Screams, shouts, death. Dalinar watched until he found himself in his quarters, tied to his chair. Renarin and Adolin watched nearby, looking tense.\r\nDalinar blinked, listening to the rain of the passing highstorm on the roof. \u201CI\u2019ve returned,\u201D he said to his sons. \u201CYou may calm yourselves.\u201D Adolin helped untie the ropes while Renarin stood up and fetched Dalinar a cup of orange wine.\r\nOnce Dalinar was free, Adolin stood back. The youth folded his arms. Renarin came back, his face pale. He looked to be having one of his episodes of weakness; indeed, his legs were trembling. As soon as Dalinar took the cup, the youth sat down in a chair and rested his head in his hands.\r\nDalinar sipped the sweet wine. He had seen wars in his visions before. He had seen deaths and monsters, greatshells and nightmares. And yet, for some reason, this one disturbed him more than any. He found his own hand shaking as he raised the cup for a second sip.\r\nAdolin was still looking at him.\r\n\u201CAm I that bad to watch?\u201D Dalinar asked.\r\n\u201CThe gibberish you speak is unnerving, Father,\u201D Renarin said. \u201CUnearthly, strange. Skewed, like a wooden building pushed to a slant by the wind.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou thrash about,\u201D Adolin said. \u201CYou nearly tipped over the chair. I had to hold it steady until you stilled.\u201D\r\nDalinar stood up, sighing as he walked over to refill his cup. \u201CAnd you still think I don\u2019t need to abdicate?\u201D\r\n\u201CThe episodes are containable,\u201D Adolin said, though he sounded disturbed. \u201CMy point was\r\nneverto get you to abdicate. I just didn\u2019t want you relying upon the delusions to make decisions about our house\u2019s future. So long as you accept that what you see isn\u2019t real, we can move on. No reason for you to give up your seat.\u201D\r\nDalinar poured the wine. He looked eastward, toward the wall, away from Adolin and Renarin. \u201CI don\u2019t accept that what I see isn\u2019t real.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat?\u201D Adolin said. \u201CBut I thought I convinced\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CI accept that I\u2019m no longer reliable,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CAnd that there\u2019s a chance I might be going mad. I accept that something is happening to me.\u201D He turned around. \u201CWhen I first began seeing these visions, I believed them to be from the Almighty. You have convinced me that I may have been too hasty in my judgment. I don\u2019t know enough to trust them. I could be mad. Or they could be supernatural without being of the Almighty.\u201D\r\n\u201CHow could that happen?\u201D Adolin said, frowning.\r\n\u201CThe Old Magic,\u201D Renarin said softly, still sitting.\r\nDalinar nodded.\r\n\u201CWhat?\u201D Adolin said pointedly. \u201CThe Old Magic is a myth.\u201D\r\n\u201CUnfortunately, it is not,\u201D Dalinar said, then took another drink of the cool wine. \u201CI know this for a fact.\u201D\r\n\u201CFather,\u201D Renarin said. \u201CFor the Old Magic to have affected you, you\u2019d have had to travel to the West and seek it. Wouldn\u2019t you?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D he said, ashamed. The empty place in his memories where his wife had once existed had never seemed as obvious to him as it did at that moment. He tended to ignore it, with good reason. She\u2019d vanished completely, and it was sometimes difficult for him to remember that he\r\nhadbeen married.\r\n\u201CThese visions are not in line with what I\u2019ve understood about the Nightwatcher,\u201D Renarin said. \u201CMost consider her to be just some kind of powerful spren. Once you\u2019ve sought her out and been given your reward and your curse, she\u2019s supposed to leave you alone. When did you seek her?\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s been many years now,\u201D Dalinar said.\r\n\u201CThen this probably isn\u2019t due to her influence,\u201D Renarin said.\r\n\u201CI agree,\u201D Dalinar said.\r\n\u201CBut what did you ask for?\u201D Adolin said, frowning.\r\n\u201CMy curse and boon are my own, son,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CThe specifics are not important.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CI agree with Renarin,\u201D Dalinar said, interrupting. \u201CThis is probably not the Nightwatcher.\u201D\r\n\u201CAll right, fine. But why bring it up?\u201D\r\n\u201CBecause, Adolin,\u201D Dalinar said, feeling exasperated. \u201CI\r\ndon\u2019t knowwhat is happening to me. These visions seem far too detailed to be products of my mind. But your arguments made me think. I could be wrong. Or\r\nyoucould be wrong, and it could be the Almighty. Or it could be something entirely different. We don\u2019t know, and that is why it is dangerous for me to be left in command.\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, what I said still holds,\u201D Adolin said stubbornly. \u201CWe can contain it.\u201D\r\n\u201CNo, we can\u2019t,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CJust because it has come only during highstorms in the past doesn\u2019t mean it couldn\u2019t expand to other times of stress. What if I were struck with an episode on the battlefield?\u201D That was the very same reason they didn\u2019t let Renarin ride into battle.\r\n\u201CIf that happens,\u201D Adolin said, \u201Cwe\u2019ll deal with it. For now, we could just ignore\u2014\u201D\r\nDalinar threw a hand up into the air. \u201CIgnore? I\r\ncannotignore something like this. The visions, the book, the things I feel\u2014they\u2019re changing every aspect of me. How can I rule if I do not follow my conscience? If I continue as highprince, I second-guess my every decision. Either I decide to trust myself, or I step down. I cannot\r\nstomachthe thought of something in-between.\u201D\r\nThe room fell silent.\r\n\u201CSo what do we do?\u201D Adolin said.\r\n\u201CWe make the choice,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201C\r\nImake the choice.\u201D\r\n\u201CStep down or keep heeding the delusions,\u201D Adolin spat. \u201CEither way we\u2019re letting them rule us.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd you have a better option?\u201D Dalinar demanded. \u201CYou\u2019ve been quick to complain, Adolin, which seems a habit of yours. But I don\u2019t see you offering a legitimate alternative.\u201D\r\n\u201CI gave you one,\u201D Adolin said. \u201CIgnore the visions and move on!\u201D\r\n\u201CI said a\r\nlegitimateoption!\u201D\r\nThe two stared at one another. Dalinar fought to keep his anger contained. In many ways, he and Adolin were too similar. They understood one another, and that enabled them to push in places that hurt.\r\n\u201CWell,\u201D Renarin said, \u201Cwhat if we proved whether or not the visions were true?\u201D\r\nDalinar glanced at him. \u201CWhat?\u201D\r\n\u201CYou say these dreams are detailed,\u201D Renarin said, leaning forward with hands clasped in front of him. \u201CWhat, exactly, do you see?\u201D\r\nDalinar hesitated, then gulped down the rest of his wine. For once he wished he had intoxicating violet instead of orange. \u201CThe visions are often of the Knights Radiant. At the end of each episode, someone\u2014I think one of the Heralds\u2014comes to me and commands me to unite the highprinces of Alethkar.\u201D\r\nThe room fell silent, Adolin looking disturbed, Renarin just sitting quietly.\r\n\u201CToday, I saw the Day of Recreance,\u201D Dalinar continued. \u201CThe Radiants abandoned their Shards and walked away. The Plate and Blades\u2026faded somehow when they were abandoned. It seems such an odd detail to have seen.\u201D He looked at Adolin. \u201CIf these visions are fantasies, then I am a great deal more clever than I once thought myself.\u201D\r\n\u201CDo you remember any specifics we could check on?\u201D Renarin asked. \u201CNames? Locations? Events that might be traced in history?\u201D\r\n\u201CThis last one was of a place called Feverstone Keep,\u201D Dalinar said.\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve never heard of it,\u201D Adolin said.\r\n\u201CFeverstone Keep,\u201D Dalinar repeated. \u201CIn my vision, there was some kind of war going on near there. The Radiants had been fighting on the front lines. They withdrew to this fortress, then abandoned their Shards there.\u201D\r\n\u201CPerhaps we could find something in history,\u201D Renarin said. \u201CProof that either this keep existed or that the Radiants didn\u2019t do what you saw there. Then we\u2019d know, wouldn\u2019t we? If the dreams are delusions or truth?\u201D\r\nDalinar found himself nodding. Proving them had never occurred to him, in part because he had assumed they were real at the start. Once he\u2019d started questioning, he\u2019d been more inclined to keep the nature of the visions hidden and silent. But if he knew that he was seeing real events\u2026well, that would at least rule out the possibility of madness. It wouldn\u2019t solve everything, but it would help a great deal.\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know,\u201D Adolin said, more skeptical. \u201CFather, you\u2019re talking about times before the Hierocracy. Will we be able to find anything in the histories?\u201D\r\n\u201CThere are histories from the time when the Radiants lived,\u201D Renarin said. \u201CThat\u2019s not as far back as the shadowdays or the Heraldic Epochs. We could ask Jasnah. Isn\u2019t this what she does? As a Veristitalian?\u201D\r\nDalinar looked at Adolin. \u201CIt sounds like it\u2019s worth a try, son.\u201D\r\n\u201CMaybe,\u201D Adolin said. \u201CBut we can\u2019t take the existence of a single place as proof. You could have heard of this Feverstone Keep, and therefore included it.\u201D\r\n\u201CWell,\u201D Renarin said, \u201Cthat may be true. But if what Father sees are just delusions, then certainly we\u2019ll be able to prove some parts of them untrue. It seems impossible that every detail he imagines is one that he got from a story or history.\r\nSomeaspects of the delusions would have to be pure fancy.\u201D\r\nAdolin nodded slowly. \u201CI\u2026You\u2019re right, Renarin. Yes, it\u2019s a good plan.\u201D\r\n\u201CWe need to get one of my scribes,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CSo I can dictate the vision I just had while it is fresh.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D Renarin said. \u201CThe more details we have, the easier it will be to prove\u2014or disprove\u2014the visions.\u201D\r\nDalinar grimaced, setting aside his cup and walking over to the others. He sat down. \u201CAll right, but who would we use to record the dictation?\u201D\r\n\u201CYou have a great number of clerks, Father,\u201D Renarin said.\r\n\u201CAnd they\u2019re all either wife or daughter to one of my officers,\u201D Dalinar said. How could he explain? It was painful enough for him to expose weakness to his sons. If news of what he saw got around to his officers, it could weaken morale. There might come a time to reveal these things to his men, but he would need to do so carefully. And he\u2019d much rather know for himself whether or not he was mad before he approached others.\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D Adolin said, nodding\u2014though Renarin still looked perplexed. \u201CI understand. But, Father, we can\u2019t afford to wait for Jasnah to return. It could be months yet.\u201D\r\n\u201CAgreed.\u201D Dalinar said. He sighed. There was another option. \u201CRenarin, send a runner for your aunt Navani.\u201D\r\nAdolin glanced at Dalinar, raising an eyebrow. \u201CIt\u2019s a good idea. But I thought you didn\u2019t trust her.\u201D\r\n\u201CI trust her to keep her word,\u201D Dalinar said, resigned. \u201CAnd to keep confidence. I told her of my plans to abdicate, and she didn\u2019t tell a soul.\u201D Navani was excellent at keeping secrets. Far better than the women of his court. He trusted them to an extent, but keeping a secret like this would require someone supremely exacting in their words and thoughts.\r\nThat meant Navani. She would probably find a way to manipulate him using the knowledge, but at least the secret would be safe from his men.\r\n\u201CGo, Renarin,\u201D Dalinar said.\r\nRenarin nodded and stood. He had apparently recovered from his fit, and walked surefooted to the door. As he left, Adolin approached Dalinar. \u201CFather, what will you do if we prove that I\u2019m right, and it\u2019s just your own mind?\u201D\r\n\u201CA part of me wishes for that to happen,\u201D Dalinar said, watching the door swing closed after Renarin. \u201CI fear madness, but at least it is something familiar, something that can be dealt with. I will give you the princedom, then seek help in Kharbranth. But if these things are\r\nnotdelusions, I face another decision. Do I accept what they tell me or not? It may very well be better for Alethkar if I prove to be mad. It will be easier, at the least.\u201D\r\nAdolin considered that, his brow furrowed, his jaw tense. \u201CAnd Sadeas? He seems to be nearing the completion of his investigation. What do we do?\u201D\r\nIt was a legitimate question. Troubles over Dalinar trusting the visions in relation to Sadeas had been what had drawn Dalinar and Adolin to argument in the first place.\r\nUnite them.That wasn\u2019t just a command from the visions. It had been Gavilar\u2019s dream. A unified Alethkar. Had Dalinar let that dream\u2014combined with guilt over failing his brother\u2014drive him to construct supernatural rationalizations for seeking his brother\u2019s will?\r\nHe felt uncertain. He\r\nhatedfeeling uncertain.\r\n\u201CVery well,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CI give you leave to prepare for the worst, just in case Sadeas moves against us. Prepare our officers and call back the companies sent to patrol for bandits. If Sadeas denounces me as having tried to kill Elhokar, we will lock down our warcamp and go on alert. I don\u2019t intend to let him bring me in for execution.\u201D\r\nAdolin looked relieved. \u201CThank you, Father.\u201D\r\n\u201CHope it doesn\u2019t come to that, son,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CThe moment Sadeas and I go to war in earnest, Alethkar as a nation will shatter. Ours are the two princedoms that uphold the king, and if we turn to strife, the others will either pick sides or turn to wars of their own.\u201D\r\nAdolin nodded, but Dalinar sat back, disturbed.\r\nI\u2019m sorry,he thought to whatever force was sending the visions.\r\nBut I have to be wise.\r\nIn a way, this seemed like a second test to him. The visions had told him to trust Sadeas. Well, he would see what happened.\r\n\u201C\u2026and then it faded,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CAfter that, I found myself back here.\u201D\r\nNavani raised her pen, looking thoughtful. It hadn\u2019t taken him long to talk through the vision. She\u2019d scribed expertly, picking out details from him, knowing when to prod for more. She hadn\u2019t said a thing about the irregularity of the request, nor had she seemed amused by his desire to write down one of his delusions. She\u2019d been businesslike and careful. She sat at his writing desk now, hair bound up in curls and crossed with four hair-spikes. Her dress was red, matched by her lip paint, and her beautiful violet eyes were curious.\r\nStormfather,Dalinar thought,\r\nbut she\u2019s beautiful.\r\n\u201CWell?\u201D Adolin asked. He stood leaning against the door out of the chamber. Renarin had gone off to collect a highstorm damage report. The lad needed practice at that sort of activity.\r\nNavani raised an eyebrow. \u201CWhat was that, Adolin?\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat do you think, Aunt?\u201D Adolin asked.\r\n\u201CI have never heard of any of these places or events,\u201D Navani said. \u201CBut I believe you weren\u2019t expecting to me to know of them. Didn\u2019t you say you wished me to contact Jasnah?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D Adolin said. \u201CBut surely you have analysis.\u201D\r\n\u201CI reserve judgment, dear,\u201D Navani said, standing up and folding the paper by pressing down with her safehand, holding it in place while she creased the fold tight. She smiled, walking by Adolin and patting him on the shoulder. \u201CLet\u2019s see what Jasnah says before we do any analyzing, shall we?\u201D\r\n\u201CI suppose,\u201D Adolin said. He sounded dissatisfied.\r\n\u201CI spent some time talking with that young lady of yours yesterday,\u201D Navani noted to him. \u201CDanlan? I think you\u2019ve made a wise choice. She\u2019s got a mind in that head of hers.\u201D\r\nAdolin perked up. \u201CYou like her?\u201D\r\n\u201CQuite a bit,\u201D Navani said. \u201CI also discovered that she is very fond of avramelons. Did you know that?\u201D\r\n\u201CI didn\u2019t, actually.\u201D\r\n\u201CGood. I would have hated to do all that work to find you a means of pleasing her, only to discover that you already knew it. I took the liberty of purchasing a basket of the melons on my way here. You\u2019ll find them in the antechamber, watched over by a bored soldier who didn\u2019t look like he was doing anything important. If you were to visit her with them this afternoon, I think you\u2019d find yourself very well received.\u201D\r\nAdolin hesitated. He probably knew that Navani was deflecting him from worrying over Dalinar. However, he relaxed, then started smiling. \u201CWell, that might make for a pleasant change, considering events lately.\u201D\r\n\u201CI thought it might,\u201D Navani said. \u201CI\u2019d suggest going soon; those melons are perfectly ripe. Besides, I wish to speak with your father.\u201D\r\nAdolin kissed Navani fondly on the cheek. \u201CThank you, Mashala.\u201D He allowed her to get away with some things that others could not; around his favored aunt, he was much like a child again. Adolin\u2019s smile widened as he made his way out the door.\r\nDalinar found himself smiling as well. Navani knew his son well. His smile didn\u2019t last long, however, as he realized that Adolin\u2019s departure left him alone with Navani. He stood up. \u201CWhat is it you wished to ask of me?\u201D he asked.\r\n\u201CI didn\u2019t say I wanted to\r\naskanything of you, Dalinar,\u201D she said. \u201CI just wanted to talk. We are family, after all. We don\u2019t spend enough time together.\u201D\r\n\u201CIf you wish to speak, I shall fetch some soldiers to accompany us.\u201D He glanced at the antechamber outside. Adolin had shut the second door at the end, closing off his view of his guards\u2014and their view of him.\r\n\u201CDalinar,\u201D she said, walking up to him. \u201CThat\r\nwouldkind of defeat the point of sending Adolin away. I was after some privacy.\u201D\r\nHe felt himself growing stiff. \u201CYou should go now.\u201D\r\n\u201CMust I?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes. People will think this is inappropriate. They will talk.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou imply that something inappropriate\r\ncouldhappen, then?\u201D Navani said, sounding almost girlishly eager.\r\n\u201CNavani, you are my\r\nsister.\u201D\r\n\u201CWe aren\u2019t related by blood,\u201D she replied. \u201CIn some kingdoms, a union between us would be mandated by tradition, once your brother died.\u201D\r\n\u201CWe aren\u2019t in other countries. This is Alethkar. There are rules.\u201D\r\n\u201CI see,\u201D she said, strolling closer to him. \u201CAnd what will you do if I\r\ndon\u2019tgo? Will you call for help? Have me hauled away?\u201D\r\n\u201CNavani,\u201D he said sufferingly. \u201CPlease. Don\u2019t do this again. I\u2019m tired.\u201D\r\n\u201CExcellent. That might make it easier to get what I want.\u201D\r\nHe closed his eyes.\r\nI can\u2019t take this right now.The vision, the confrontation with Adolin, his own uncertain emotions\u2026He didn\u2019t know what to make of things any longer.\r\nTesting the visions was a good decision, but he couldn\u2019t shake the disorientation he felt from being unable to decide what to do next. He liked to make decisions and stick to them. He couldn\u2019t do that.\r\nIt grated on him.\r\n\u201CI thank you for your scribing and for your willingness to keep this quiet,\u201D he said, opening his eyes. \u201CBut I really must ask you to leave\r\nnow, Navani.\u201D\r\n\u201COh, Dalinar,\u201D she said softly. She was close enough that he could smell her perfume. Stormfather, but she was beautiful. Seeing her brought to his mind thoughts of days long past, when he\u2019d desired her so strongly that he\u2019d nearly grown to hate Gavilar for winning her affection.\r\n\u201CCan\u2019t you just relax,\u201D she asked him, \u201Cjust for a little while?\u201D\r\n\u201CThe rules\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CEveryone else\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CI cannot be\r\neveryone else!\u201D Dalinar said, more sharply than he intended. \u201CIf I ignore our code and ethics, what am I, Navani? The other highprinces and lighteyes deserve recrimination for what they do, and I have let them know it. If\r\nIabandon my principles, then I become something far worse than they. A hypocrite!\u201D\r\nShe froze.\r\n\u201CPlease,\u201D he said, tense with emotion. \u201CJust go. Do not taunt me today.\u201D\r\nShe hesitated, then walked away without a word.\r\nShe would never know how much he wished her to have made one more objection. In his state, he likely would have been unable to argue further. Once the door shut, he let himself sit down in his chair, exhaling. He closed his eyes.\r\nAlmighty above,he thought.\r\nPlease. Just let me know what I am to do."

      "ChapterName": "53: DUNNY",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\n\u201CHe must pick it up, the fallen title! The tower, the crown, and the spear!\u201D\r\n\u2014Dated Vevahach, 1173, 8 seconds pre-death. Subject: a prostitute. Back ground unknown.\r\nA razor-edged arrow snapped into the wood next to Kaladin\u2019s face. He could feel warm blood seep from a gash on his cheek, creeping down his face, mixing with the sweat dripping from his chin.\r\n\u201CStay firm!\u201D he bellowed, charging over the uneven ground, the bridge\u2019s familiar weight on his shoulders. Nearby\u2014just ahead and to the left\u2014Bridge Twenty floundered, four men at the front falling to arrows, their corpses tripping up those behind.\r\nThe Parshendi archers knelt on the other side of the chasm, singing calmly despite the hail of arrows from Sadeas\u2019s side. Their black eyes were like shards of obsidian. No whites. Just that emotionless black. In those moments\u2014listening to men scream, cry, yell, howl\u2014Kaladin hated the Parshendi as much as he hated Sadeas and Amaram. How could they sing while they killed?\r\nThe Parshendi in front of Kaladin\u2019s crew pulled and aimed. Kaladin screamed at them, feeling a strange surge of strength as the arrows were loosed.\r\nThe shafts zipped through the air in a focused wave. Ten shafts struck the wood near Kaladin\u2019s head, their force throwing a shudder through it, chips of wood splintering free. But not a one struck flesh.\r\nAcross the chasm, several of the Parshendi lowered their bows, breaking off their chanting. Their demonic faces bore looks of stupefaction.\r\n\u201CDown!\u201D Kaladin yelled as the bridge crew reached the chasm. The ground was rough here, covered in bulbous rockbuds. Kaladin stepped on the vine from one of them, causing the plant to retract. The bridgemen heaved the bridge up and off their shoulders, then expertly stepped aside, lowering it to the ground. Sixteen other bridge crews lined up with them, setting their bridges down. Behind, Sadeas\u2019s heavy cavalry thundered across the plateau toward them.\r\nThe Parshendi drew again.\r\nKaladin gritted his teeth, throwing his weight against one of the wooden bars on the side, helping shove the massive construction across the chasm. He hated this part; the bridgemen were so exposed.\r\nSadeas\u2019s archers kept firing, moving to a focused, disruptive attack intended to force back the Parshendi. As always, the archers didn\u2019t seem to mind if they hit bridgemen, and several of those shafts flew dangerously close to Kaladin. He continued to push\u2014sweating, bleeding\u2014and felt a stab of pride for Bridge Four. They were already beginning to move like warriors, light on their feet, moving erratically, making it more difficult for the archers to draw a bead on them. Would Gaz or Sadeas\u2019s men notice?\r\nThe bridge thumped into place, and Kaladin bellowed the retreat. Bridgemen ducked out of the way, dodging between thick-shafted black Parshendi arrows and lighter green-fletched ones from Sadeas\u2019s archers. Moash and Rock hoisted themselves up onto the bridge and ran across it, leaping down beside Kaladin. Others scattered around the back of the bridge, ducking in front of the oncoming cavalry charge.\r\nKaladin lingered, waving for his men to get out of the way. Once they were all free, he glanced back at the bridge, which bristled with arrows. Not a single man down. A miracle. He turned to run\u2014\r\nSomeone stumbled to his feet on the other side of the bridge. Dunny. The youthful bridgeman had a white and green fletched arrow sprouting from his shoulder. His eyes were wide, dazed.\r\nKaladin cursed, running back. Before he\u2019d taken two steps, a black-hafted arrow took the youth in the other side. He fell to the deck of the bridge, blood spraying the dark wood.\r\nThe charging horses did not slow. Frantic, Kaladin reached the side of the bridge, but something pulled him back. Hands on his shoulder. He stumbled, spinning to find Moash there. Kaladin snarled at him, trying to shove the man aside, but Moash\u2014using a move Kaladin himself had taught him\u2014yanked Kaladin sideways, tripping him. Moash threw himself down, holding Kaladin to the ground as heavy cavalry thundered across the bridge, arrows cracking against their silvery armor.\r\nBroken bits of arrow sprinkled to the ground. Kaladin struggled for a moment, but then let himself fall still.\r\n\u201CHe\u2019s dead,\u201D Moash said, harshly. \u201CThere\u2019s nothing you could have done. I\u2019m sorry.\u201D\r\nThere\u2019s nothing you could have done\u2026.\r\nThere isn\u2019t ever anything I can do. Stormfather, why can\u2019t I save them?\r\nThe bridge stopped shaking, the cavalry smashing into the Parshendi and making space for the foot soldiers, who clanked across next. The cavalry would retreat after the foot soldiers gained purchase, the horses too valuable to risk in extended fighting.\r\nYes,Kaladin thought.\r\nThink about the tactics. Think about the battle. Don\u2019t think about Dunny.\r\nHe pushed Moash off him, rising. Dunny\u2019s corpse was mangled beyond recognition. Kaladin set his jaw and turned, striding away without looking back. He brushed past the watching bridgemen and stepped up to the lip of the chasm, clasping his hands to his forearms behind his back, feet spread. It wasn\u2019t dangerous, so long as he stood far down from the bridge. The Parshendi had put away bows and were falling back. The chrysalis was a towering, oval stone mound on the far left side of the plateau.\r\nKaladin wanted to watch. It helped him think like a soldier, and thinking like a soldier helped him get over the deaths of those near him. The other bridgemen tentatively approached and filled in around him, standing at parade rest. Even Shen the parshman joined them, silently imitating the others. He\u2019d joined every bridge run so far without complaint. He didn\u2019t refuse to march against his cousins; he didn\u2019t try to sabotage the assault. Gaz was disappointed, but Kaladin wasn\u2019t surprised. That was how parshmen were.\r\nExcept the ones on the other side of the chasm. Kaladin stared at the fighting, but had difficulty focusing on the tactics. Dunny\u2019s death tore at him too much. The lad had been a friend, one of the first to support him, one of the best of the bridgemen.\r\nEach bridgeman dead edged them closer to disaster. It would take weeks to train the men properly. They\u2019d lose half of their number\u2014perhaps even more\u2014before they were anywhere near ready to fight. That wasn\u2019t good enough.\r\nWell, you\u2019ll have to find a way to fix it,Kaladin thought. He\u2019d made his decision, and had no room for despair. Despair was a luxury.\r\nHe broke parade rest and stalked away from the chasm. The other bridgemen turned to look after him, surprised. Kaladin had recently taken to watching entire battles standing like that. Sadeas\u2019s soldiers had noticed. Many saw it as bridgemen behaving above their station. A few, however, seemed to respect Bridge Four for the display. He knew there were rumors about him because of the storm; these were adding to those.\r\nBridge Four followed, and Kaladin led them across the rocky plateau. He pointedly did not look again at the broken, mangled body on the bridge. Dunny had been one of the only bridgemen to retain any hint of innocence. And now he was dead, trampled by Sadeas, struck by arrows from both sides. Ignored, forgotten, abandoned.\r\nThere was nothing Kaladin could do for him. So instead, Kaladin made his way to where the members of Bridge Eight lay, exhausted, on a patch of open stone. Kaladin remembered lying like that after his first bridge runs. Now he barely felt winded.\r\nAs usual, the other bridge crews had left their wounded behind as they retreated. One poor man from Eight was crawling toward the others, an arrow through his thigh. Kaladin walked up to him. He had dark brown skin and brown eyes, his thick black hair pulled back into a long, braided tail. Painspren crawled around him. He looked up with as Kaladin and the members of Bridge Four loomed over him.\r\n\u201CHold still,\u201D Kaladin said softly, kneeling and gently turning the man to get a good look at the wounded thigh. Kaladin prodded at it, thoughtful. \u201CTeft, we\u2019ll need a fire. Get out your tinder. Rock, you still have my needle and thread? I\u2019ll need that. Where\u2019s Lopen with the water?\u201D\r\nThe members of Bridge Four were silent. Kaladin looked up from the confused, wounded man.\r\n\u201CKaladin,\u201D Rock said. \u201CYou know how the other bridge crews have treated us.\u201D\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t care,\u201D Kaladin said.\r\n\u201CWe don\u2019t have any money left,\u201D Drehy said. \u201CEven pooling our income, we barely have enough for bandages for our own men.\u201D\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t care.\u201D\r\n\u201CIf we care for the wounded of other bridge crews,\u201D Drehy said, shaking a blond head, \u201Cwe\u2019ll have to feed them, tend them\u2026.\u201D\r\n\u201CI will find a way,\u201D Kaladin said.\r\n\u201CI\u2014\u201D Rock began.\r\n\u201CStorm you!\u201D Kaladin said, standing and sweeping his hand over the plateau. The bodies of bridgemen lay scattered, ignored. \u201CLook at that! Who cares for them? Not Sadeas. Not their fellow bridgemen. I doubt even the Heralds themselves spare a thought for these.\r\n\u201CI won\u2019t stand there and watch while men die behind me. We have to be better than that! We can\u2019t look away like the lighteyes, pretending we don\u2019t see. This man is one of us. Just like Dunny was.\r\n\u201CThe lighteyes talk about honor. They spout empty claims about their nobility. Well, I\u2019ve only known\r\noneman in my life who was a true man of honor. He was a surgeon who would help anyone, even those who hated him. Especially those who hated him. Well, we\u2019re going to show Gaz, and Sadeas, Hashal, and any other sodden fool who cares to watch, what he taught me. Now go to work and\r\nstop complaining!\u201D\r\nBridge Four stared at him with wide, ashamed eyes, then burst into motion. Teft organized a triage unit, sending some men to search for other wounded bridgemen and others to gather rockbud bark for a fire. Lopen and Dabbid rushed off to fetch their litter.\r\nKaladin knelt down and felt at the wounded man\u2019s leg, checking to see how quickly the blood leaked, and determined that he wouldn\u2019t need to cauterize. He broke the shaft and wiped the wound with some conicshell mucus for numbing. Then he pulled the wood free, eliciting a grunt, and used his personal set of bandages to wrap the wound.\r\n\u201CHold this with your hands,\u201D Kaladin instructed. \u201CAnd don\u2019t walk on it. I\u2019ll check on you before we march back to camp.\u201D\r\n\u201CHow\u2026\u201D the man said. He didn\u2019t have even a hint of an accent. Kaladin had expected him to be Azish because of the dark skin. \u201CHow will I get back if I can\u2019t walk on the leg?\u201D\r\n\u201CWe will carry you,\u201D Kaladin said.\r\nThe man looked up, obviously shocked. \u201CI\u2026\u201D Tears formed in his eyes. \u201CThank you.\u201D\r\nKaladin nodded curtly, turning as Rock and Moash brought over another wounded man. Teft had a fire growing; it smelled of pungent wet rockbud. The new man had hit his head and had a long gash in his arm. Kaladin held out a hand for his thread.\r\n\u201CKaladin, lad,\u201D Teft said with a soft voice, handing him the thread and kneeling. \u201CNow, don\u2019t mark this as complaining, because it ain\u2019t. But how many men can we really carry back with us?\u201D\r\n\u201CWe\u2019ve done three before,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CLashed to the top of the bridge. I\u2019ll bet we could fit three more and carry another in the water litter.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd if we have more than seven?\u201D\r\n\u201CIf we bandage them right, some might be able to walk.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd if there are still more?\u201D\r\n\u201CStorm it, Teft,\u201D Kaladin said, beginning to sew. \u201CThen we bring the ones we can and haul the bridge back out again to fetch those we left behind. We\u2019ll bring Gaz with us if the soldiers worry that we\u2019ll run away.\u201D\r\nTeft was silent, and Kaladin steeled himself for incredulity. Instead, however, the grizzled soldier smiled. He actually seemed a little watery-eyed. \u201CKelek\u2019s breath. It\u2019s true. I never thought\u2026\u201D\r\nKaladin frowned, looking up at Teft and holding a hand to the wound to stanch the bleeding. \u201CWhat was that?\u201D\r\n\u201COh, nothing.\u201D He scowled. \u201CGet back to work! That lad needs you.\u201D\r\nKaladin turned back to his sewing.\r\n\u201CYou still carrying a full pouch of spheres with you, like I told you?\u201D Teft asked.\r\n\u201CI can\u2019t very well leave them behind in the barracks. But we\u2019ll need to spend them soon.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou\u2019ll do nothing of the sort,\u201D Teft said. \u201CThose spheres are luck, you hear me? Keep them with you and always keep them infused.\u201D\r\nKaladin sighed. \u201CI think there\u2019s something wrong with this batch. They won\u2019t hold their Stormlight. They fall dun after just a few days, every time. Perhaps it\u2019s something to do with the Shattered Plains. It has happened to the other bridgemen too.\u201D\r\n\u201COdd, that,\u201D Teft said, rubbing his chin. \u201CThis was a bad approach. Three bridges down. Lots of bridgemen dead. Interesting how we didn\u2019t lose anyone.\u201D\r\n\u201CWe lost Dunny.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut not on the approach. You always run point, and the arrows always seem to miss us. Odd, eh?\u201D\r\nKaladin looked up again, frowning. \u201CWhat are you saying, Teft?\u201D\r\n\u201CNothing. Get back to that sewing! How many times do I have to tell you?\u201D\r\nKaladin raised an eyebrow, but turned back to his work. Teft had been acting very strange lately. Was it the stress? A lot of people were superstitious about spheres and Stormlight.\r\nRock and his team brought three more wounded, then said that was all they\u2019d found. Bridgemen who fell often ended up like Dunny, getting trampled. Well, at least Bridge Four wouldn\u2019t have to make a return trip to the plateau.\r\nThe three had bad arrow wounds, and so Kaladin left the man with the gash on his arm to them, instructing Skar to keep pressure on the unfinished sewing job. Teft heated a dagger for cauterization; these newcomers had obviously lost a lot of blood. One probably wouldn\u2019t make it.\r\nSo much of the world is at war,he thought as he worked. The dream had highlighted what others already spoke of. Kaladin hadn\u2019t known, growing up in remote Hearthstone, how fortunate his town had been to avoid battle.\r\nThe entire world warred, and he struggled to save a few impoverished bridgemen. What good did it do? And yet he continued searing flesh, sewing, saving lives as his father had taught him. He began to understand the sense of futility he\u2019d seen in his father\u2019s eyes on those occasional darkened nights when Lirin had turned to his wine in solitude.\r\nYou\u2019re trying to make up for failing Dunny,Kaladin thought.\r\nHelping these others won\u2019t bring him back.\r\nHe lost the one he\u2019d suspected would die, but saved the other four, and the one who\u2019d taken a knock to the head was beginning to wake up. Kaladin sat back on his knees, weary, hands covered in blood. He washed them off with a stream of water from Lopen\u2019s waterskins, then reached up, finally remembering his own wound, where the arrow had sliced his cheek.\r\nHe froze. He prodded at his skin, but couldn\u2019t find the wound. He had felt blood on his cheek and chin. He\u2019d felt the arrow slice him, hadn\u2019t he?\r\nHe stood up, feeling a chill, and raised his hand to his forehead. What was happening?\r\nSomeone stepped up beside him. Moash\u2019s now-clean-shaven face exposed a faded scar along his chin. He studied Kaladin. \u201CAbout Dunny\u2026\u201D\r\n\u201CYou were right to do what you did,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CYou probably saved my life. Thank you.\u201D\r\nMoash nodded slowly. He turned to look at the four wounded men; Lopen and Dabbid were giving them drinks of water, asking their names \u201CI was wrong about you,\u201D Moash said suddenly, holding out a hand to Kaladin.\r\nKaladin took the hand, hesitant. \u201CThank you.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou\u2019re a fool and an instigator. But you\u2019re an honest one.\u201D Moash chuckled to himself. \u201CIf you get us killed, it won\u2019t be on purpose. Can\u2019t say that for some I\u2019ve served under. Anyway, let\u2019s get these men ready for moving.\u201D"

      "ChapterName": "54: GIBLETISH",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\n\u201CThe burdens of nine become mine. Why must I carry the madness of them all? Oh, Almighty, release me.\u201D\r\n\u2014Dated Palaheses, 1173, unknown seconds pre-death. Subject: a wealthy lighteyes. Sample collected secondhand.\r\nThe cold night air threatened that a stretch of winter might soon be coming. Dalinar wore a long, thick uniform coat over trousers and shirt. It buttoned stiffly up the chest and to the collar, and was long in the back and on the sides, coming down to his ankles, flowing at the waist like a cloak. In earlier years, it might have been worn with a takama, though Dalinar had never liked the skirtlike garments.\r\nThe purpose of the uniform was not fashion or tradition, but to distinguish him easily for those who followed him. He wouldn\u2019t have nearly the problem with the other lighteyes if they would at least wear their colors.\r\nHe stepped onto the king\u2019s feasting island. Stands had been set up at the sides where the braziers normally stood, each one bearing one of those new fabrials that gave off heat. The stream between the islands had slowed to a trickle; ice had stopped melting in the highlands.\r\nAttendance at the feast tonight was small, though that was mostly manifest on the four islands that were not the king\u2019s. Where there was access to Elhokar and the highprinces, people would attend even if the feast were held\u00A0in the middle of a highstorm. Dalinar walked down the central pathway, and Navani\u2014sitting at a women\u2019s dining table\u2014caught his eyes. She turned away, perhaps still remembering his abrupt words to her at their last meeting.\r\nWit wasn\u2019t at his customary place insulting those who walked onto the king\u2019s island; in fact, he wasn\u2019t to be seen at all.\r\nNot surprising,Dalinar thought. Wit didn\u2019t like to grow predictable; he\u2019d spent several recent feasts on his pedestal doling out insults. Likely he felt he\u2019d played out that tactic.\r\nAll nine other highprinces were in attendance. Their treatment of Dalinar had grown stiff and cold since refusing his requests to fight together. As if they were offended by the mere offer. Lesser lighteyes made alliances, but the highprinces were like kings themselves. Other highprinces were rivals, to be kept at arm\u2019s length.\r\nDalinar sent a servant to fetch him food and sat down at the table. His arrival had been delayed while he took reports from the companies he\u2019d called back, so he was one of the last to eat. Most of the others had turned to mingling. To the right, an officer\u2019s daughter was playing a serene flute melody to a group of onlookers. To the left, three women had set up sketchpads and were each drawing the same man. Women were known to challenge each other to duels in the way of men with Shardblades, though they rarely used the word. These were always \u201Cfriendly competitions\u201D or \u201Cgames of talent.\u201D\r\nHis food arrived, steamed stagm\u2014a brownish tuber that grew in deep puddles\u2014atop a bed of boiled tallew. The grain was puffed with water, and the entire meal was drenched in a thick, peppery, brown gravy. He slid out his knife and sliced a disk off the end of the stagm. Using his knife to spread tallew over the top, he grasped the vegetable disk between two fingers and began eat. It had been prepared both spicy and hot this night, probably because of the chill, and tasted good as he chewed, the steam from his plate fogging the air in front of him.\r\nSo far, Jasnah had not replied regarding his vision, though Navani claimed she might be able to find something on her own. She was a renowned scholar herself, though her interests had always been more in fabrials. He glanced at her. Was he a fool to offend her as he had? Would it make her use the knowledge of his visions against him?\r\nNo,he thought.\r\nShe wouldn\u2019t be that petty.Navani\r\ndidseem to care for him, though her affection was inappropriate.\r\nThe chairs around him were left empty. He was becoming a pariah, first because of his talk of the Codes, then because of his attempts to get the highprinces to work with him, and finally because of Sadeas\u2019s investigation. No wonder Adolin was worried.\r\nSuddenly, someone slid right into the seat beside Dalinar, wearing a black cloak against the chill. It wasn\u2019t one of the highprinces. Who would dare\u2014\r\nThe figure lowered his hood, revealing Wit\u2019s hawklike face. All lines and peaks, with a sharp nose and jaw, delicate eyebrows, and keen eyes. Dalinar sighed, waiting for the inevitable stream of too-clever quips.\r\nWit, however, didn\u2019t speak. He inspected the crowd, his expression intense.\r\nYes,Dalinar thought.\r\nAdolin is right about this one too.Dalinar himself had judged the man too harshly in the past. He was not the fool some of his predecessors had been. Wit continued in silence, and Dalinar decided that\u2014perhaps\u2014the man\u2019s prank this night was to sit down beside people and unnerve them. It wasn\u2019t much of a prank, but Dalinar often missed the point of what Wit did. Perhaps it was terribly clever if one had the mind for it. Dalinar returned to his meal.\r\n\u201CWinds are changing,\u201D Wit whispered.\r\nDalinar glanced at him.\r\nWit\u2019s eyes narrowed, and he scanned the night sky. \u201CIt\u2019s been happening for months now. A whirlwind. Shifting and churning, blowing us round and around. Like a world spinning, but we can\u2019t see it because we\u2019re too much a part of it.\u201D\r\n\u201CWorld spinning. What foolishness is this?\u201D\r\n\u201CThe foolishness of men who care, Dalinar,\u201D Wit said. \u201CAnd the brilliance of those who do not. The second depend on the first\u2014but also exploit the first\u2014while the first misunderstand the second, hoping that the second are more like the first. And all of their games steal our time. Second by second.\u201D\r\n\u201CWit,\u201D Dalinar said with a sigh. \u201CI haven\u2019t the mind for this tonight. I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019m missing your intent, but I have no idea what you mean.\u201D\r\n\u201CI know,\u201D Wit said, then looked directly at him. \u201CAdonalsium.\u201D\r\nDalinar frowned more deeply. \u201CWhat?\u201D\r\nWit searched his face. \u201CHave you ever heard the term, Dalinar?\u201D\r\n\u201CAdo\u2026what?\u201D\r\n\u201CNothing,\u201D Wit said. He seemed preoccupied, unlike his usual self. \u201CNonsense. Balderdash. Figgldygrak. Isn\u2019t it odd that gibberish words are often the sounds of other words, cut up and dismembered, then stitched into something like them\u2014yet wholly unlike them at the same time?\u201D\r\nDalinar frowned.\r\n\u201CI wonder if you could do that to a man. Pull him apart, emotion by emotion, bit by bit, bloody chunk by bloody chunk. Then combine them back together into something else, like a Dysian Aimian. If you do put a man together like that, Dalinar, be sure to name him Gibberish, after me. Or perhaps Gibletish.\u201D\r\n\u201CIs that your name, then? Your real name?\u201D\r\n\u201CNo, my friend,\u201D Wit said, standing up. \u201CI\u2019ve abandoned my real name. But when next we meet, I\u2019ll think of a clever one for you to call me. Until then, Wit will suffice\u2014or if you must, you may call me Hoid. Watch yourself; Sadeas is planning a revelation at the feast tonight, though I know not what it is. Farewell. I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t insult you more.\u201D\r\n\u201CWait, you\u2019re leaving?\u201D\r\n\u201CI must. I hope to return. I\u2019ll do so if I\u2019m not killed. Probably will anyway. Apologize to your nephew for me.\u201D\r\n\u201CHe won\u2019t be happy,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CHe\u2019s fond of you.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes, it\u2019s one of his more admirable traits,\u201D Wit said. \u201CAlongside that of paying me, letting me eat his expensive food, and giving me opportunity to make sport of his friends. The cosmere, unfortunately, takes precedence over free food. Watch yourself, Dalinar. Life becomes dangerous, and you\u2019re at the center of it.\u201D\r\nWit nodded once, then ducked into the night. He put his hood up, and soon Dalinar couldn\u2019t separate him from the darkness.\r\nDalinar turned back to his meal.\r\nSadeas is planning a revelation at the feast tonight, though I know not what it is.Wit was rarely wrong\u2014though he was almost always odd. Was he really leaving, or would he still be in camp the next morning, laughing at the prank he had played on Dalinar?\r\nNo,Dalinar thought.\r\nThat wasn\u2019t a prank.He waved over a master-servant in black and white. \u201CFetch my elder son for me.\u201D\r\nThe servant bowed and withdrew. Dalinar ate the rest of his food in silence, glancing occasionally at Sadeas and Elhokar. They weren\u2019t at the dining table any longer, and so Sadeas\u2019s wife had joined them. Ialai was a curvaceous woman who reportedly dyed her hair. That indicated foreign blood in her family\u2019s past\u2014Alethi hair always bred true, proportionate to how much Alethi blood you had. Foreign blood would mean stray hairs of another color. Ironically, mixed blood was far more common in lighteyes than darkeyes. Darkeyes rarely married foreigners, but the Alethi houses often needed alliances or money from outside.\r\nFood finished, Dalinar stepped down from the king\u2019s table onto the island proper. The woman was still playing her melancholy song. She was quite good. A few moments later, Adolin strode onto the king\u2019s island. He hurried over to Dalinar. \u201CFather? You sent for me?\u201D\r\n\u201CStay close. Wit told me that Sadeas plans to make a storm of something tonight.\u201D\r\nAdolin\u2019s expression darkened. \u201CTime to go, then.\u201D\r\n\u201CNo. We need to let this play out.\u201D\r\n\u201CFather\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CBut you\r\nmayprepare,\u201D Dalinar said softly. \u201CJust in case. You invited officers of our guard to the feast tonight?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D Adolin said. \u201CSix of them.\u201D\r\n\u201CThey have my further invitation to the king\u2019s island. Pass the word. What of the King\u2019s Guard?\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve made sure that some of the ones guarding the island tonight are among those most loyal to you.\u201D Adolin nodded toward a space in the darkness to the side of the feasting basin. \u201CI think we should position them over there. It\u2019ll make a good line of retreat in case the king tries to have you arrested.\u201D\r\n\u201CI still don\u2019t think it will come to that.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou can\u2019t be sure. Elhokar allowed this investigation in the first place, after all. He\u2019s growing more and more paranoid.\u201D\r\nDalinar glanced over at the king. The younger man almost always wore his Shardplate these days, though he didn\u2019t have it on now. He seemed continually on edge, glancing over his shoulder, eyes darting from side to side.\r\n\u201CLet me know when the men are in position,\u201D Dalinar said.\r\nAdolin nodded, walking away quickly.\r\nThe situation gave Dalinar little stomach for mingling. Still, standing alone and looking awkward was no better, so he made his way to where Highprince Hatham was speaking with a small group of lighteyes beside the main firepit. They nodded to Dalinar as he joined them; regardless of the way they were treating him in general, they would never turn him away at a feast like this. That simply wasn\u2019t done to one of his rank.\r\n\u201CAh, Brightlord Dalinar,\u201D Hatham said in his smooth, overly polite way. The long-necked, slender man wore a ruffled green shirt underneath a robelike coat, with a darker green silk scarf around the neck. A faintly glowing ruby sat on each of his fingers; they\u2019d each had some of their Stormlight drained away by a fabrial made for the purpose.\r\nOf Hatham\u2019s four companions, two were lesser lighteyes and one was a short white-robed ardent Dalinar didn\u2019t know. The last was a red-gloved Natan man with bluish skin and stark white hair, two locks dyed a deep red and braided down to hang alongside his cheeks. He was a visiting dignitary; Dalinar had seen him at the feasts. What was his name again?\r\n\u201CTell me, Brightlord Dalinar,\u201D Hatham said. \u201CHave you been paying much attention to the conflict between the Tukari and the Emuli?\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s a religious conflict, isn\u2019t it?\u201D Dalinar asked. Both were Makabaki kingdoms, on the southern coast where trade was plentiful and profitable.\r\n\u201CReligious?\u201D the Natan man said. \u201CNo, I wouldn\u2019t say that. All conflicts are essentially economic in nature.\u201D\r\nAu-nak,Dalinar recalled.\r\nThat\u2019s his name. He spoke with an airy accent, overextending all of his \u201Cah\u201D and \u201Coh\u201D sounds.\r\n\u201CMoney is behind every war,\u201D Au-nak continued. \u201CReligion is but an excuse. Or perhaps a justification.\u201D\r\n\u201CThere\u2019s a difference?\u201D the ardent said, obviously taking offense at Au-nak\u2019s tone.\r\n\u201COf course,\u201D Au-nak said. \u201CAn excuse is what you make after the deed is done, while a justification is what you offer before.\u201D\r\n\u201CI would say an excuse is something you claim, but do not believe, Nak-ali.\u201D Hatham was using the high form of Au-nak\u2019s name. \u201CWhile a justification is something you actually believe.\u201D Why such respect? The Natan must have something that Hatham wanted.\r\n\u201CRegardless,\u201D Au-nak said. \u201CThis particular war is over the city of Sesemalex Dar, which the Emuli have made their capital. It\u2019s an excellent trade city, and the Tukari want it.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve heard of Sesemalex Dar,\u201D Dalinar said, rubbing his chin. \u201CThe city is quite spectacular, filling rifts cut into the stone.\u201D\r\n\u201CIndeed,\u201D Au-nak said. \u201CThere\u2019s a particular composition of the stone there that lets water drain. The design is amazing. It\u2019s obviously one of the Dawncities.\u201D\r\n\u201CMy wife would have something to say on that,\u201D Hatham said. \u201CShe makes the Dawncities her study.\u201D\r\n\u201CThe city\u2019s pattern is central to the Emuli religion,\u201D the ardent said. \u201CThey claim it is their ancestral homeland, a gift to them from the Heralds. And the Tukari are led by that god-priest of theirs, Tezim. So the conflict\r\nisreligious in nature.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd if the city weren\u2019t such a fantastic port,\u201D Au-nak said, \u201Cwould they be as persistent about proclaiming the city\u2019s religious significance? I think not. They\u2019re pagans, after all, so we can\u2019t presume their religion has any real importance.\u201D\r\nTalk of the Dawncities had been popular lately among the lighteyes\u2014the idea that certain cities could trace their origins back to the Dawnsingers. Perhaps\u2026\r\n\u201CHave any of you heard of a place known as Feverstone Keep?\u201D Dalinar asked.\r\nThe others shook their heads; even Au-nak had nothing to say.\r\n\u201CWhy?\u201D Hatham asked.\r\n\u201CJust curious.\u201D\r\nThe conversation continued, though Dalinar let his attention wander back toward Elhokar and his circle of attendants. When would Sadeas make his announcement? If he intended to suggest that Dalinar be arrested, he wouldn\u2019t do it at a feast, would he?\r\nDalinar forced his attention back to the conversation. He really should pay more heed to what was happening in the world. Once, news of which kingdoms were in conflict had fascinated him. So much had changed since the visions began.\r\n\u201CPerhaps it\u2019s not economic or religious in nature,\u201D Hatham said, trying to bring an end to the argument. \u201CEveryone knows that the Makabaki tribes have odd hatreds of one another.\u201D\r\n\u201CPerhaps,\u201D Au-nak said.\r\n\u201CDoes it matter?\u201D Dalinar asked.\r\nThe others turned to him.\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s just another war. If they weren\u2019t fighting one another, they\u2019d find others to attack. It\u2019s what we do. Vengeance, honor, riches, religion\u2014the reasons all just produce the same result.\u201D\r\nThe others fell still, the silence quickly growing awkward.\r\n\u201CWhich devotary do you credit, Brightlord Dalinar?\u201D Hatham asked, thoughtful, as if trying to remember something he\u2019d forgotten.\r\n\u201CThe Order of Talenelat.\u201D\r\n\u201CAh,\u201D Hatham said. \u201CYes, it makes sense. They do hate arguing over religion. You must find this discussion terribly boring.\u201D\r\nA safe out from the conversation. Dalinar smiled, nodding in thanks to Hatham\u2019s politeness.\r\n\u201CThe Order of Talenelat?\u201D Au-nak said. \u201CI always considered that a devotary for the lesser people.\u201D\r\n\u201CThis from a Natan,\u201D the Ardent said, stuffily.\r\n\u201CMy family has always been devoutly Vorin.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D the ardent replied, \u201Cconveniently so, since your family has used its Vorin ties to trade favorably in Alethkar. One wonders if you are equally devout when not standing on our soil.\u201D\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t have to be insulted like this,\u201D Au-nak snapped.\r\nHe turned and strode way, causing Hatham to raise a hand. \u201CNak-ali!\u201D Hatham called, rushing after him anxiously. \u201CPlease, ignore him!\u201D\r\n\u201CInsufferable bore,\u201D the ardent said softly, taking a sip of his wine\u2014orange, of course, as he was a man of the clergy.\r\nDalinar frowned at him. \u201CYou are bold, ardent,\u201D he said sternly. \u201CPerhaps foolishly so. You insult a man Hatham wants to do business with.\u201D\r\n\u201CActually, I belong to Brightlord Hatham,\u201D the ardent said. \u201CHe\r\naskedme to insult his guest\u2014Brightlord Hatham wants Au-nak to think that he is shamed. Now, when Hatham agrees quickly to Au-nak\u2019s demands, the foreigner will assume it was because of this\u2014and won\u2019t delay the contract signing out of suspicion that it is proceeding too easily.\u201D\r\nAh, of course.Dalinar looked after the fleeing pair.\r\nThey go to such lengths.\r\nConsidering that, what was Dalinar to think of Hatham\u2019s politeness earlier, when he had given Dalinar a reason to explain his apparent distaste for conflict? Was Hatham preparing Dalinar for some covert manipulation?\r\nThe ardent cleared his throat. \u201CI would appreciate it if you did not repeat to anyone what I just told you, Brightlord.\u201D Dalinar noticed Adolin returning to the king\u2019s island, accompanied by six of Dalinar\u2019s officers, in uniform and wearing their swords.\r\n\u201CWhy did you tell me in the first place, then?\u201D Dalinar asked, turning his attention back to the white-robed man.\r\n\u201CJust as Hatham wishes his partner in negotiations to know of his goodwill, I wish you to know of our goodwill toward you, Brightlord.\u201D\r\nDalinar frowned. He\u2019d never had much to do with the ardents\u2014his devotary was simple and straightforward. Dalinar got his fill of politics with the court; he had little desire to find more in religion. \u201CWhy? What should it matter if I have goodwill toward you?\u201D\r\nThe ardent smiled. \u201CWe will speak with you again.\u201D He bowed low and withdrew.\r\nDalinar was about to demand more, but Adolin arrived, looking after Highprince Hatham. \u201CWhat was that all about?\u201D\r\nDalinar just shook his head. Ardents weren\u2019t supposed to engage in politics, whatever their devotary. They\u2019d been officially forbidden to do so since the Hierocracy. But, as with most things in life, the ideal and the reality were two separate things. The lighteyes couldn\u2019t help but use the ardents in their schemes, and so\u2014more and more\u2014the devotaries found themselves a part of the court.\r\n\u201CFather?\u201D Adolin asked. \u201CThe men are in place.\u201D\r\n\u201CGood,\u201D Dalinar said. He set his jaw and then crossed the small island. He would see this fiasco finished with, once and for all.\r\nHe passed the firepit, a wave of dense heat making the left side of his face prickle with sweat while the right side was still chilled by the autumn cold. Adolin hurried up to walk by him, hand on his side sword. \u201CFather? What are we doing?\u201D\r\n\u201CBeing provocative,\u201D Dalinar said, striding right up to where Elhokar and Sadeas were chatting. Their crowd of sycophants reluctantly parted for Dalinar.\r\n\u201C\u2026and I think that\u2014\u201D The king cut off, glancing at Dalinar. \u201CYes, Uncle?\u201D\r\n\u201CSadeas,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CWhat is the status of your investigation of the cut girth strap?\u201D\r\nSadeas blinked. He held a cup of violet wine in his right hand, his long, red velvet robe open at the front to expose a ruffled white shirt. \u201CDalinar, are you\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CYour investigation, Sadeas,\u201D Dalinar said firmly.\r\nSadeas sighed, looking at Elhokar. \u201CYour Majesty. I was actually planning to make an announcement regarding this very subject tonight. I was going to wait until later, but if Dalinar is going to be so insistent\u2026\u201D\r\n\u201CI am,\u201D Dalinar said.\r\n\u201COh, go ahead, Sadeas,\u201D the king said. \u201CYou have me curious now.\u201D The king waved to a servant, who rushed to quiet the flutist while another servant tapped the chimes to call for silence. In moments, the people on the island stilled.\r\nSadeas gave Dalinar a grimace that somehow conveyed the message, \u201CYou demanded this, old friend.\u201D\r\nDalinar folded his arms, keeping his gaze fixed on Sadeas. His six Cobalt Guardsmen stepped up behind him, and Dalinar noticed that a group of similar lighteyed officers from Sadeas\u2019s warcamp were listening nearby.\r\n\u201CWell, I wasn\u2019t planning to have such an audience,\u201D Sadeas said. \u201CMostly, this was planned for Your Majesty only.\u201D\r\nUnlikely,Dalinar thought, trying to suppress his anxiety. What would he do if Adolin was right and Sadeas charged him with trying to assassinate Elhokar?\r\nIt would, indeed, be the end of Alethkar. Dalinar would not go quietly, and the warcamps would turn against one another. The nervous peace that had held them together for the last decade would come to an end. Elhokar would never be able to hold them together.\r\nAlso, if it turned to battle, Dalinar would not fare well. The others were alienated from him; he\u2019d have enough trouble facing Sadeas\u2014if several of the others joined against him, he would fall, horribly outnumbered. He could see now Adolin thought it an incredible act of foolishness to have listened to the visions. And yet, in a powerfully surreal moment, Dalinar felt that he\u2019d done the correct thing. He\u2019d never felt it as strongly as at that moment, preparing to be condemned.\r\n\u201CSadeas, don\u2019t weary me with your sense of drama,\u201D Elhokar said. \u201CThey\u2019re listening. I\u2019m listening. Dalinar looks like he\u2019s ready to burst a vein in his forehead. Speak.\u201D\r\n\u201CVery well,\u201D Sadeas said, giving his wine to a servant. \u201CMy very first task as Highprince of Information was to discover the true nature of the attempt on His Majesty\u2019s life during the greatshell hunt.\u201D He waved a hand, motioning to one of his men, who hurried away. Another stepped forward, handing Sadeas the broken leather strap.\r\n\u201CI took this strap to three separate leatherworkers in three different warcamps. Each came to the same conclusion. It was cut. The leather is relatively new, and has been well cared for, as proven by the lack of cracking and flaking in other areas. The tear is too even. Someone slit it.\u201D\r\nDalinar felt a sense of dread. That was near what he had discovered, but it was presented in the worst possible light. \u201CFor what purpose\u2014\u201D Dalinar began.\r\nSadeas held up a hand. \u201CPlease, Highprince. First you demand I report, then you interrupt me?\u201D\r\nDalinar fell still. Around them, more and more of the important light-eyes were gathering. He could sense their tension.\r\n\u201CBut when was it cut?\u201D Sadeas said, turning to address the crowd. He did have a flair for the dramatic. \u201CThat was pivotal, you see. I took leave to interview numerous men who were on that hunt. None reported seeing anything specific, though all remembered that there was one odd event. The time when Brightlord Dalinar and His Majesty raced to a rock formation. A time when Dalinar and the king were alone.\u201D\r\nThere were whispers from behind.\r\n\u201CThere was a problem, however,\u201D Sadeas said. \u201COne Dalinar himself raised. Why cut the strap on a Shardbearer\u2019s saddle? A foolish move. A horseback fall wouldn\u2019t be of much danger to a man wearing Shardplate.\u201D To the side, the servant Sadeas had sent away returned, leading a youth with sandy hair bearing only a few hints of black.\r\nSadeas fished something out of a pouch at his waist, holding it up. A large sapphire. It wasn\u2019t infused. In fact, looking closely, Dalinar could see that it was cracked\u2014it wouldn\u2019t hold Stormlight now. \u201CThe question drove me to investigate the king\u2019s Shardplate,\u201D Sadeas said. \u201CEight of the ten sapphires used to infuse his Plate were cracked following the battle.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt happens,\u201D Adolin said, stepping up beside Dalinar, hand on his side sword. \u201CYou lose a few in every battle.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut eight?\u201D Sadeas asked. \u201COne or two is normal. But have you ever lost eight in one battle before, young Kholin?\u201D\r\nAdolin\u2019s only reply was a glare.\r\nSadeas tucked away the gemstone, nodding to the youth his men had brought. \u201CThis is one of the grooms in the king\u2019s employ. Fin, isn\u2019t it?\u201D\r\n\u201CY\u2026Yes, brightlord,\u201D the boy stammered. He couldn\u2019t be older than twelve.\r\n\u201CWhat is it you told me earlier, Fin? Please, say it again so that all may hear.\u201D\r\nThe darkeyed youth cringed, looking sick. \u201CWell, Brightlord sir, it was just this: Everyone spoke of the saddle being checked over in Brightlord Dalinar\u2019s camp. And I suppose it was, right as that. But I\u2019m the one who prepared His Majesty\u2019s horse afore it was turned over to Brightlord Dalinar\u2019s men. And I\u00A0did it, I promise I did. Put on his favorite saddle and everything. But\u2026\u201D\r\nDalinar\u2019s heart raced. He had to hold himself back from summoning his Blade.\r\n\u201CBut what?\u201D Sadeas said to Fin.\r\n\u201CBut when the king\u2019s head grooms took the horse past on its way to the Highprince Dalinar\u2019s camp, it was wearing a different saddle. I swear it.\u201D\r\nSeveral of those standing around them seemed confused by this admission.\r\n\u201CAha!\u201D Adolin said, pointing. \u201CBut that happened in the king\u2019s palace complex!\u201D\r\n\u201CIndeed,\u201D Sadeas said, raising an eyebrow at Adolin. \u201CHow keen-minded of you, young Kholin. This discovery\u2014mixed with the cracked gemstones\u2014means something. I suspect that whoever attempted to kill His Majesty planted in his Shardplate flawed gemstones that would crack when strained, losing their Stormlight. Then they weakened the saddle girth with a careful slit. The hope would be that His Majesty would fall while fighting a great-shell, allowing it to attack him. The gemstones would fail, the Plate would break, and His Majesty would fall to an \u2018accident\u2019 while hunting.\u201D\r\nSadeas raised a finger as the crowd began to whisper again. \u201CHowever, it is important to realize that these events\u2014the switching of the saddle or the planting of the gemstones\u2014must have happened before His Majesty met up with Dalinar. I feel that Dalinar is a very unlikely suspect. In fact, my present guess is that the culprit is someone that Brightlord Dalinar has offended; that someone wanted us all to think he might be involved. It may not have actually been intended to kill His Majesty, just to cast suspicion upon Dalinar.\u201D\r\nThe island fell silent, even the whispers dying.\r\nDalinar stood, stunned.\r\nI\u2026I was right!\r\nAdolin finally broke the quiet. \u201C\r\nWhat?\u201D\r\n\u201CAll evidence points to your father being innocent, Adolin,\u201D Sadeas said sufferingly. \u201CYou find this surprising?\u201D\r\n\u201CNo, but\u2026\u201D Adolin\u2019s brow furrowed.\r\nAround them, the lighteyes began talking, sounding disappointed. They began to disperse. Dalinar\u2019s officers remained standing behind him, as if expecting a surprise strike.\r\nBlood of my fathers\u2026Dalinar thought.\r\nWhat does it mean?\r\nSadeas waved for his men to take the groom away, then nodded to Elhokar and withdrew in the direction of the evening trays, where warmed wine sat in pitchers next to toasted breads. Dalinar caught up to Sadeas as the shorter man was filling a small plate. Dalinar took him by the arm, the fabric of Sadeas\u2019s robe soft beneath his fingers.\r\nSadeas looked at him, raising an eyebrow.\r\n\u201CThank you,\u201D Dalinar said quietly. \u201CFor not going through with it.\u201D Behind them, the flutist resumed her playing.\r\n\u201CFor not going through with what?\u201D Sadeas said, setting down his small plate, then prying Dalinar\u2019s fingers free. \u201CI had hoped to make this presentation after I\u2019d discovered more concrete proof that you weren\u2019t involved. Unfortunately, pressed as I was, the best I could do was to indicate that it was unlikely you were involved. There will still be rumors, I\u2019m afraid.\u201D\r\n\u201CWait. You\r\nwantedto prove me innocent?\u201D\r\nSadeas scowled, picking up his plate again. \u201CDo you know what your problem is, Dalinar? Why everyone has begun finding you so tiresome?\u201D\r\nDalinar didn\u2019t reply.\r\n\u201CThe presumption. You\u2019ve grown despicably self-righteous. Yes, I asked Elhokar for this position so I could prove you innocent. Is it so storming difficult for you to believe someone else in this army might do something honest?\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2026\u201D Dalinar said.\r\n\u201COf course it is,\u201D Sadeas said. \u201CYou\u2019ve been looking down on us like a man standing atop a single sheet of paper, who therefore thinks himself so high as to see for miles. Well, I think that book of Gavilar\u2019s is crem, and the Codes are lies people pretended to follow so that they could justify their shriveled consciences. Damnation, I\u2019ve got one of those shriveled consciences myself. But I didn\u2019t want to see you maligned for this bungled attempt to kill the king. If you\u2019d wanted him dead, you\u2019d have just burned out his eyes and been done with it!\u201D\r\nSadeas took a drink of his steaming violet wine. \u201CThe problem is, Elhokar kept on and on about that blasted strap. And people started talking, since he was under your protection and you two rode off together like that. Stormfather only knows how they could think\r\nyouwould try to have Elhokar assassinated. You can barely bring yourself to kill Parshendi these days.\u201D Sadeas stuffed a small piece of toasted bread in his mouth, then moved to walk away.\r\nDalinar caught him by the arm again. \u201CI\u2026I owe you a debt. I shouldn\u2019t have treated you as I have these six years.\u201D\r\nSadeas rolled his eyes, chewing his bread. \u201CThis wasn\u2019t for you alone. So long as everyone thought you were behind the attempt, nobody would figure out who really tried to have Elhokar killed. And someone\r\ndid, Dalinar. I don\u2019t accept eight gemstones cracking in one fight. The strap alone would have been a ridiculous way to attempt an assassination, but with weakened Shardplate\u2026I\u2019m half tempted to believe that the surprise arrival of the chasmfiend was orchestrated too. How someone would manage that though, I have no idea.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd the talk of me being framed?\u201D Dalinar asked.\r\n\u201CMostly to give the others something to gossip about while I sort through what\u2019s really happening.\u201D Sadeas looked down at Dalinar\u2019s hand on his arm. \u201CWould you let go?\u201D\r\nDalinar released his grip.\r\nSadeas set down his plate, straightening his robe and dusting off the shoulder. \u201CI haven\u2019t give up on you yet, Dalinar. I\u2019m probably going to need you before this is all through. I do have to say, though, I don\u2019t know what to make of you lately. That talk of you wanting to abandon the Vengeance Pact. Is there any truth to that?\u201D\r\n\u201CI mentioned it, in confidence, to Elhokar as a means of exploring options. So yes, there\u2019s truth to it, if you must know. I\u2019m tired of this fighting. I\u2019m tired of these Plains, of being away from civilization, of killing Parshendi a handful at a time. However, I\u2019ve given up on getting us to retreat. Instead, I want to\r\nwin. But the highprinces won\u2019t listen! They all assume that I\u2019m trying to dominate them with some crafty trick.\u201D\r\nSadeas snorted. \u201CYou\u2019d sooner punch a man in the face than stab him in the back. Blessedly straightforward.\u201D\r\n\u201CAlly with me,\u201D Dalinar said after him.\r\nSadeas froze.\r\n\u201CYou know I\u2019m not going to betray you, Sadeas,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CYou trust me as the others never can. Try what I\u2019ve been trying to get the other highprinces to agree to. Jointly assault plateaus with me.\u201D\r\n\u201CWon\u2019t work,\u201D Sadeas said. \u201CThere\u2019s no reason to bring more than one army on an assault. I leave half my troops behind each time as it is. There isn\u2019t room for more to maneuver.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes, but think,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CWhat if we tried new tactics? Your quick bridge crews are fast, but my troops are stronger. What if you pushed quickly to a plateau with an advance force to hold off the Parshendi? You could hold until my stronger, but slower, forces arrive.\u201D\r\nThat gave Sadeas pause.\r\n\u201CIt could mean a Shardblade, Sadeas.\u201D\r\nSadeas\u2019s eyes grew hungry.\r\n\u201CI know you\u2019ve fought Parshendi Shardbearers,\u201D Dalinar said, seizing on that thread, \u201CBut you\u2019ve lost. Without a Blade, you\u2019re at a disadvantage.\u201D Parshendi Shardbearers had a habit of escaping after entering battles. Regular spearmen couldn\u2019t kill one, of course. It took a Shardbearer to kill a Shardbearer. \u201CI\u2019ve slain two in the past. I don\u2019t often have the opportunity, however, because I can\u2019t get to the plateaus quickly enough. You can. Together, we can win more often, and\r\nIcan get you a Blade. We can do this, Sadeas. Together. Like the old days.\u201D\r\n\u201CThe old days,\u201D he said idly. \u201CI\u2019d like to see the Blackthorn in battle again. How would we split the gemhearts?\u201D\r\n\u201CTwo-thirds to you,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CAs you\u2019ve got twice as good a record at winning assaults as I have.\u201D\r\nSadeas looked thoughtful. \u201CAnd the Shardblades?\u201D\r\n\u201CIf we find a Shardbearer, Adolin and I will take him. You win the Blade.\u201D He raised a finger. \u201CBut I win the Plate. To give to my son, Renarin.\u201D\r\n\u201CThe invalid?\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat would you care?\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CYou already have Plate. Sadeas, this could mean\r\nwinningthe war. If we start to work together, we could bring the others in, prepare for a large-scale assault. Storms! We might not even need that. We two have the largest armies; if we could find a way to catch the Parshendi on a large enough plateau with the bulk of our troops\u2014surrounding them so they couldn\u2019t escape\u2014we might be able to damage their forces enough to bring an end to this all.\u201D\r\nSadeas mulled it over. Then he shrugged. \u201CVery well. Send me details via messenger. But do it later. I\u2019ve already missed too much of tonight\u2019s feast.\u201D"

      "ChapterName": "55: AN EMERALD BROAM",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\n\u201CA woman sits and scratches out her own eyes. Daughter of kings and winds, the vandal.\u201D\r\n\u2014Dated Palahevan, 1173, 73 seconds pre-death. Subject: a beggar of some renown, known for his elegant songs.\r\nOne week after losing Dunny, Kaladin stood on another plateau, watching a battle proceed. This time, however, he didn\u2019t have to save the dying. They\u2019d actually arrived\r\nbeforethe Parshendi. A rare but welcome event. Sadeas\u2019s army was now holding out at the center of the plateau, protecting the chrysalis while some of his soldiers cut into\u00A0it.\r\nThe Parshendi kept leaping over the line and attacking the men working on the chrysalis.\r\nHe\u2019s getting surrounded,Kaladin thought. It didn\u2019t look good, which would mean a miserable return trip. Sadeas\u2019s men were bad enough when, arriving second, they were rebuffed. Losing the gemheart after arriving first\u2026would leave them even more frustrated.\r\n\u201CKaladin!\u201D a voice said. Kaladin spun to see Rock trotting up. Was someone wounded? \u201CHave you seen this thing?\u201D The Horneater pointed.\r\nKaladin turned, following his gesture. Another army was approaching on an adjacent plateau. Kaladin raised eyebrows; the banners flapped blue, and the soldiers were obviously Alethi.\r\n\u201CA little late, aren\u2019t they?\u201D Moash asked, standing beside Kaladin.\r\n\u201CIt happens,\u201D Kaladin said. Occasionally another highprince would arrive after Sadeas got to the plateau. More often, Sadeas arrived first, and the other Alethi army had to turn around. Usually they didn\u2019t get this close before doing so.\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s the standard of Dalinar Kholin,\u201D Skar said, joining them.\r\n\u201CDalinar,\u201D Moash said appreciatively. \u201CThey say he doesn\u2019t use bridgemen.\u201D\r\n\u201CHow does he cross the chasms, then?\u201D Kaladin asked.\r\nThe answer soon became obvious. This new army had enormous, siege-tower-like bridges pulled by chulls. They rumbled across the uneven plateaus, often having to pick their way around rifts in the stone.\r\nThey must be terribly slow,Kaladin thought. But, in trade, the army wouldn\u2019t have to approach the chasm while being fired on. They could hide behind those bridges.\r\n\u201CDalinar Kholin,\u201D Moash said. \u201CThey say he\u2019s a true lighteyes, like the men from the old days. A man of honor and of oaths.\u201D\r\nKaladin snorted. \u201CI\u2019ve seen plenty of lighteyes with that same reputation, and I\u2019ve been disappointed by them every time. I\u2019ll tell you about Brightlord Amaram sometime.\u201D\r\n\u201CAmaram?\u201D Skar asked. \u201CThe Shardbearer?\u201D\r\n\u201CYou\u2019ve heard of that?\u201D Kaladin asked.\r\n\u201CSure,\u201D Skar said. \u201CHe\u2019s supposed to be on his way here. Everyone\u2019s talking about it in the taverns. Were you with him when he won his Shards?\u201D\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D Kaladin said softly. \u201CNobody was.\u201D\r\nDalinar Kholin\u2019s army approached across the plateau to the south. Amazingly, Dalinar\u2019s army came right up to the battlefield plateau.\r\n\u201CHe\u2019s attacking?\u201D Moash said, scratching his head. \u201CMaybe he figures that Sadeas will lose, and wants to take a stab at it after he retreats.\u201D\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D Kaladin said, frowning. \u201CHe\u2019s joining the battle.\u201D\r\nThe Parshendi army sent over some archers to fire on Dalinar\u2019s army, but their arrows bounced off the chulls without causing any harm. A group of soldiers unhooked the bridges and pushed them into place while Dalinar\u2019s archers set up and exchanged fire with the Parshendi.\r\n\u201CDoes it seem Sadeas took fewer soldiers with him this run?\u201D Sigzil asked, joining the group watching Dalinar\u2019s army. \u201CPerhaps he planned for this. Could be why he was willing to commit like he did, letting himself get surrounded.\u201D\r\nThe bridges could be cranked to lower and extend; there was some marvelous engineering at work. As they began to work, something decidedly strange happened: Two Shardbearers, likely Dalinar and his son, leaped across the chasm and began attacking the Parshendi. The distraction let the soldiers get the large bridges into place, and some heavy cavalry charged across to help. It was a completely different method of doing a bridge assault, and Kaladin found himself considering the implications.\r\n\u201CHe really\r\nisjoining the battle,\u201D Moash said. \u201CI think they\u2019re going to work together.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s bound to be more effective,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CI\u2019m surprised they haven\u2019t tried it before.\u201D\r\nTeft snorted. \u201CThat\u2019s because you don\u2019t understand how lighteyes think. Highprinces don\u2019t just want to win the battle, they want to win it by themselves.\u201D\r\n\u201CI wish I\u2019d been recruited in his army instead,\u201D Moash said, almost reverent. The soldiers\u2019 armor gleamed, their ranks obviously well-practiced. Dalinar\u2014the Blackthorn\u2014had done an even better job than Amaram at cultivating a reputation for honesty. People knew of him all the way back in Hearthstone, but Kaladin understood the kinds of corruption a well-polished breastplate could hide.\r\nThough,he thought,\r\nthat man who protected the whore on the street, he wore blue. Adolin, Dalinar\u2019s son. He seemed genuinely selfless in his defense of the woman.\r\nKaladin set his jaw, casting aside those thoughts. He would not be taken in again.\r\nHe would\r\nnot.\r\nThe fighting grew brutal for a short time, but the Parshendi were overwhelmed\u2014smashed between two opposing forces. Soon, Kaladin\u2019s team led a victorious group of soldiers back to the camps for celebration.\r\nKaladin rolled the sphere between his fingers. The otherwise pure glass had cooled with a thin line of bubbles permanently frozen along one side. The bubbles were tiny spheres of their own, catching light.\r\nHe was on chasm scavenging duty. They\u2019d gotten back from the plateau assault so quickly that Hashal, in defiance of logic or mercy, had sent them down into the chasm that very day. Kaladin continued to turn the sphere in his fingers. Hanging in the very center of it was a large emerald cut in a round shape, with dozens of tiny facets along the sides. A small rim of suspended bubbles clung to the side of gemstone, as if longing to be near its brilliance.\r\nBright, crystalline green Stormlight shone from inside the glass, lighting Kaladin\u2019s fingers. An emerald broam, the highest denomination of sphere. Worth hundreds of lesser spheres. To bridgemen, this was a fortune. A strangely distant one, for spending it was impossible. Kaladin thought he could see some of the storm\u2019s tempest inside that rock. The light was like\u2026it was like part of the storm, captured by the emerald. The light wasn\u2019t perfectly steady; it just seemed that way compared with the flickering of candles, torches, or lamps. Holding it close, Kaladin could see the light swirling, raging.\r\n\u201CWhat do we do with it?\u201D Moash asked from Kaladin\u2019s side. Rock stood at Kaladin\u2019s other side. The sky was overcast, making it darker than usual here at the bottom. The cold weather of late had drawn back to spring, though it was uncomfortably chilly.\r\nThe men worked efficiently, quickly gathering spears, armor, boots, and spheres from the dead. Because of the short time given them\u2014and because of the exhausting bridge run earlier\u2014Kaladin had decided to forgo spear practice for the day. They\u2019d load up on salvage instead and stow some of it down beneath, to be used for avoiding punishment next time.\r\nAs they\u2019d worked, they\u2019d found a lighteyed officer. He had been quite wealthy. This single emerald broam was worth what a bridgeman slave would make in two hundred days. In the same pouch with it, they\u2019d found a collection of chips and marks that totaled slightly more than another emerald broam. Wealth. A fortune. Simply pocket change to a lighteyes.\r\n\u201CWith this we could feed those wounded bridgemen for months,\u201D Moash said. \u201CWe could buy all the medical supplies we could want. Stormfather! We could probably bribe the camp\u2019s perimeter guards to let us sneak away.\u2019\r\n\u201CThis thing will not happen,\u201D Rock said. \u201CIs impossible to get spheres out of the chasms.\u201D\r\n\u201CWe could swallow them,\u201D Moash said.\r\n\u201CYou would choke. Spheres are too big, eh?\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll bet I could do it,\u201D Moash said. His eyes glittered, reflecting the verdant Stormlight. \u201CThat\u2019s more money than I\u2019ve ever seen. It\u2019s worth the risk.\u201D\r\n\u201CSwallowing won\u2019t work,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CYou think those guards who watch us in the latrines are there to keep us from fleeing? I\u2019ll bet some sodden parshman has to go through our droppings, and I\u2019ve seen them keep record of who visits and how often. We aren\u2019t the first to think of swallowing spheres.\u201D\r\nMoash hesitated, then sighed, crestfallen. \u201CYou\u2019re probably right. Storm you, but you are. But we can\u2019t just give it to them, can we?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes, we can,\u201D Kaladin said, closing his fist around the sphere. The glow was bright enough to make his hand shine. \u201CWe\u2019d never be able to spend it. A bridgeman with a full broam? It would give us away.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut\u2014\u201D Moash began.\r\n\u201CWe give it to them, Moash.\u201D Then he held up the pouch containing the other spheres. \u201CBut we find a way to keep these.\u201D\r\nRock nodded. \u201CYes. If we give up this expensive sphere, they will think us honest, eh? It will disguise the theft, and they will even give us small reward. But how can we do this thing, keeping the pouch?\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m working on that,\u201D Kaladin said.\r\n\u201CWork fast, then,\u201D Moash said, glancing at Kaladin\u2019s torch, rammed between two rocks at the side of the chasm. \u201CWe\u2019ll need to head back up soon.\u201D\r\nKaladin opened his hand and rolled the emerald sphere between his fingers. How? \u201CHave you ever seen anything so beautiful?\u201D Moash asked, staring at the emerald.\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s just a sphere,\u201D Kaladin said absently. \u201CA tool. I once held a goblet full of a hundred diamond broams and was told they were mine. Since I never got to spend them, they were as good as worthless.\u201D\r\n\u201CA hundred diamonds?\u201D Moash asked. \u201CWhere\u2026how?\u201D\r\nKaladin closed his mouth, cursing himself.\r\nI shouldn\u2019t keep mentioning things like that.\u201CGo on,\u201D he said, tucking the emerald broam back into the black pouch. \u201CWe need to be quick.\u201D\r\nMoash sighed, but Rock thumped him on the back good-naturedly and they joined the rest of the bridgemen. Rock and Lopen\u2014using Syl\u2019s directions\u2014had led them to a large mass of corpses in red-and-brown uniforms. He didn\u2019t know which highprince\u2019s men they were, but the bodies were pretty fresh. There were no Parshendi among them.\r\nKaladin glanced to the side, where Shen\u2014the parshman bridgeman\u2014worked. Quiet, obedient, stalwart. Teft still didn\u2019t trust him. A part of Kaladin was glad for that. Syl landed on the wall beside him, standing with her feet planted against the surface and looking up at the sky.\r\nThink,Kaladin told himself.\r\nHow do we keep these spheres? There has to be a way.But each possibility seemed too much of a risk. If they were caught stealing, they\u2019d probably be given a different work detail. Kaladin wasn\u2019t willing to risk that.\r\nSilent green lifespren began to fade into existence around him, bobbing around the moss and haspers. A few frillblooms opened up fronds of red and yellow beside his head. Kaladin had thought again and again about Dunny\u2019s death. Bridge Four was not safe. True, they\u2019d lost a remarkably small number of men lately, but they were still dwindling. And each bridge run was a chance for total disaster. All it took was one time, with the Parshendi focusing on them. Lose three or four men, and they\u2019d topple. The waves of arrows would redouble, cutting every one of them down.\r\nIt was the same old problem, the one Kaladin had beaten his head against day after day. How did you protect bridgemen when everyone wanted them exposed and endangered?\r\n\u201CHey Sig,\u201D Maps said, walking by carrying an armload of spears. \u201CYou\u2019re a Worldsinger, right?\u201D Maps had grown increasingly friendly in the last few weeks, and had proven good at getting the others talking. The balding man reminded Kaladin of an innkeeper, always quick to make his patrons feel at ease.\r\nSigzil\u2014who was pulling the boots off a line of corpses\u2014gave Kaladin a straight-lipped glance that seemed to say, \u201CThis is your fault.\u201D He didn\u2019t like that others had discovered he was a Worldsinger.\r\n\u201CWhy don\u2019t you give us a tale?\u201D Maps said, setting down his armload. \u201CHelp us pass the time.\u201D\r\n\u201CI am not a foolish jester or storyteller,\u201D Sigzil said, yanking off a boot. \u201CI do not \u2018give tales.\u2019 I spread knowledge of cultures, peoples, thoughts, and dreams. I bring peace through understanding. It is the holy charge my order received from the Heralds themselves.\u201D\r\n\u201CWell why not start spreading then?\u201D Maps said, standing and wiping his hands on his trousers.\r\nSigzil signed audibly. \u201CVery well. What is it you wish to hear about?\u201D\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know. Something interesting.\u201D\r\n\u201CTell us about Brightking Alazansi and the hundred-ship fleet,\u201D Leyten called.\r\n\u201CI am not a storyteller!\u201D Sigzil repeated. \u201CI speak of nations and peoples, not tavern stories. I\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CIs there a place where people live in gouges in the ground?\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CA city built in an enormous complex of lines, all set into the rock as if carved there?\u201D\r\n\u201CSesemalex Dar,\u201D Sigzil said, nodding, pulling off another boot. \u201CYes, it is the capital of the kingdom of Emul, and is one of the most ancient cities in the world. It is said that the city\u2014and, indeed, the kingdom\u2014were named by Jezrien himself.\u201D\r\n\u201CJezrien?\u201D Malop said, standing and scratching his head. \u201CWho\u2019s that?\u201D Malop was a thick-haired fellow with a bushy black beard and a glyphward tattoo on each hand. He also wasn\u2019t the brightest sphere in the goblet, so to speak.\r\n\u201CYou call him the Stormfather, here in Alethkar,\u201D Sigzil said. \u201COr Jezerezeh\u2019Elin. He was king of the Heralds. Master of the storms, bringer of water and life, known for his fury and his temper, but also for his mercy.\u201D\r\n\u201COh,\u201D Malop said.\r\n\u201CTell me more of the city,\u201D Kaladin said.\r\n\u201CSesemalex Dar. It is, indeed, built in giant troughs. The pattern is quite amazing. It protects against highstorms, as each trough has a lip at the side, keeping water from streaming in off the stone plain around it. That, mixed with a drainage system of cracks, protects the city from flooding.\r\n\u201CThe people there are known for their expert crem pottery; the city is a major waypoint in the southwest. The Emuli are a certain tribe of the Askarki people, and they\u2019re ethnically Makabaki\u2014dark-skinned, like myself. Their kingdom borders my own, and I visited there many times in my youth.\r\n\u201CIt is a wondrous place, filled with exotic travelers.\u201D Sigzil grew more relaxed as he continued to talk. \u201CTheir legal system is very lenient toward foreigners. A man who is not of their nationality cannot own a home or shop, but when you visit, you are treated as a \u2018relative who has traveled from afar, to be shown all kindness and leniency.\u2019 A foreigner can take dinner at any residence he calls upon, assuming he is respectful and offers a gift of fruit. The people are most interested in exotic fruits. They worship Jezrien, though they don\u2019t accept him as a figure from the Vorin religion. They name him the only god.\u201D\r\n\u201CThe Heralds aren\u2019t gods,\u201D Teft scoffed.\r\n\u201CTo you they aren\u2019t,\u201D Sigzil said. \u201COthers regard them differently. The Emuli have what your scholars like to call a splinter religion\u2014containing some Vorin ideas. But to the Emuli, you would be the splinter religion.\u201D Sigzil seemed to find that amusing, though Teft just scowled.\r\nSigzil continued in more and more detail, talking of the flowing gowns and head-wraps of the Emuli women, the robes favored by the men. The taste of the food\u2014salty\u2014and the way of greeting an old friend\u2014by holding the left forefinger to the forehead and bowing in respect. Sigzil knew an impressive amount about them. Kaladin noticed him smiling wistfully at times, probably recalling his travels.\r\nThe details were interesting, but Kaladin was more taken aback by the fact that this city\u2014which he had flown over in his dream weeks ago\u2014was actually real. And he could no longer ignore the strange speed at which he recovered from wounds. Something odd was happening to him. Something supernatural. What if it was related to the fact that everyone around him always seemed to die?\r\nHe knelt down to begin rifling the pockets of the dead men, a duty the other bridgemen avoided. Spheres, knives, and other useful objects were kept. Personal mementoes like unburned prayers were left with the bodies. He found a few zircon chips, which he added to the pouch.\r\nMaybe Moash was right. If they could get this money out, could they\r\nbribetheir way free of the camp? That would certainly be safer than fighting. So why was he so insistent on teaching the bridgemen to fight? Why hadn\u2019t he given any thought to sneaking the bridgemen out?\r\nHe had lost Dallet and the others of his original squad in Amaram\u2019s army. Did he think to compensate for that by training a new group of spearmen? Was this about saving men he\u2019d grown to love, or was it just about proving something to himself?\r\nHis experience told him that men who could not fight were at a severe disadvantage in this world of war and storms. Perhaps sneaking out would have been the better option, but he knew little of stealth. Besides, if they sneaked away, Sadeas would send troops after them. Trouble would track them down. Whatever their path, the bridgemen would have to kill to remain free.\r\nHe squeezed his eyes shut, remembering one of his escape attempts, when he\u2019d kept his fellow slaves free for an entire week, hiding in the wilderness. They\u2019d finally been caught by their master\u2019s hunters. That was when he\u2019d lost Nalma.\r\nNone of that has to do with saving them here and now,Kaladin told himself.\r\nI need these spheres.\r\nSigzil was still talking about the Emuli. \u201CTo them,\u201D the Worldsinger said, \u201Cthe need to strike a man personally is crass. They wage war in the opposite way from you Alethi. The sword is not a weapon for a leader. A halberd is better, then a spear, and best of all a bow and arrow.\u201D\r\nKaladin pulled another handful of spheres\u2014skychips\u2014from a soldier\u2019s pocket. They were stuck to an aged hunk of sow\u2019s cheese, fragrant and moldy. He grimaced, picking the spheres out and washing them in a puddle.\r\n\u201CSpears, used by lighteyes?\u201D Drehy said. \u201CThat\u2019s ridiculous.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhy?\u201D Sigzil said, sounding offended. \u201CI find the Emuli way to be interesting. In some countries, it is seen as displeasing to fight at all. To the Shin, for instance, if you must fight a man, then you have already failed. Killing is, at best, a brutish way of solving problems.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou\u2019re not going be like Rock and refuse to fight, are you?\u201D Skar asked, shooting a barely-veiled glare at the Horneater. Rock sniffed and turned his back on the shorter man, kneeling down to shove boots into a large sack.\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D Sigzil said. \u201CI think we can all agree that other methods have failed. Perhaps if my master knew I still lived\u2026but no. That is foolish. Yes, I will fight. And if I have to, the spear seems a favorable weapon, though I honestly would prefer to put more distance between myself and my enemies.\u201D\r\nKaladin frowned. \u201CYou mean with a bow?\u201D\r\nSigzil nodded. \u201CAmong my people, the bow is a noble weapon.\u201D\r\n\u201CDo you know how to use one?\u201D\r\n\u201CAlas, no,\u201D Sigzil said. \u201CI would have mentioned it before now if I had such proficiency.\u201D\r\nKaladin stood up, opening the pouch and depositing the spheres in with the others. \u201CWere there any bows among the bodies?\u201D\r\nThe men glanced at each other, several of them shaking heads.\r\nStorm it, Kaladin thought. The seed of an idea had begun to sprout in his mind, but that killed it.\r\n\u201CGather up some of those spears,\u201D he said. \u201CSet them aside. We\u2019ll need them for training.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut we have to turn them in,\u201D Malop said.\r\n\u201CNot if we don\u2019t take them with us up out of the chasm,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CEach time we come scavenging, we\u2019ll save a few spears and stash them down here. It shouldn\u2019t take long to gather enough to practice with.\u201D\r\n\u201CHow will we get them out when it\u2019s time to escape?\u201D Teft asked, rubbing his chin. \u201CSpears left down here won\u2019t do these lads much good once the real fighting starts.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll find a way to get them up,\u201D Kaladin said.\r\n\u201CYou say things like that a lot,\u201D Skar noted.\r\n\u201CLeave off, Skar,\u201D Moash said. \u201CHe knows what he\u2019s doing.\u201D\r\nKaladin blinked. Had\r\nMoashjust defended him?\r\nSkar flushed. \u201CI didn\u2019t mean it like that, Kaladin. I\u2019m just asking, that\u2019s all.\u201D\r\n\u201CI understand. It\u2019s\u2026\u201D Kaladin trailed off as Syl flitted down into the chasm in the form of a curling ribbon.\r\nShe landed on a rock outcropping on the wall, taking on her female form. \u201CI found another group of bodies. They\u2019re mostly Parshendi.\u201D\r\n\u201CAny bows?\u201D Kaladin asked. Several of the bridgemen gawked at him until they saw him staring into the air. Then they nodded knowingly to one another.\r\n\u201CI think so,\u201D Syl said. \u201CIt\u2019s just down this way. Not too far.\u201D\r\nThe bridgemen had mostly finished with these bodies. \u201CGather up the things,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CI\u2019ve found us another place to scavenge. We need to gather as much as we can, then stash some in a chasm where it has a good chance of not being washed away.\u201D\r\nThe bridgemen picked up their findings, slinging sacks over their shoulders and each man hefting a spear or two. Within moments, they headed down the dank chasm bottom, following Syl. They passed clefts in the ancient rock walls where old, storm-washed bones had gotten lodged, creating a mound of moss-covered femurs, tibia, skulls, and ribs. There wasn\u2019t much salvage among them.\r\nAfter about a quarter-hour, they came to the place Syl had found. A scattered group of Parshendi dead lay in heaps, mixed with the occasional Alethi in blue. Kaladin knelt beside one of the human bodies. He recognized Dalinar Kholin\u2019s stylized glyphpair sewn on the coat. Why\r\nhadDalinar\u2019s army joined Sadeas\u2019s in battle? What had changed?\r\nKaladin pointed for the men to begin scavenging from the Alethi while he walked over to one of the Parshendi corpses. It was much fresher than Dalinar\u2019s man. They didn\u2019t find nearly as many Parshendi corpses as they did Alethi. Not only were there fewer of them in any given battle, but they were less likely to fall to their deaths into the chasms. Sigzil also guessed that their bodies were more dense than human ones, and didn\u2019t float or wash away as easily.\r\nKaladin rolled the body onto its side, and the action elicited a sudden hiss from the back of the group of bridgemen. Kaladin turned to see Shen pushing forward in an uncharacteristic display of passion.\r\nTeft moved quickly, grabbing Shen from behind, placing him in a choke hold. The other bridgemen stood, aghast, though several fell into their stances by reflex.\r\nShen struggled weakly against Teft\u2019s grip. The parshman looked different from his dead cousins; close together, the differences were much more obvious. Shen\u2014like most parshmen\u2014was short and a little plump. Stout, strong, but not threatening. The corpse at Kaladin\u2019s feet, however, was muscled and built like a Horneater, easily as tall as Kaladin and far broader at the shoulders. While both had the marbled skin, the Parshendi had those strange, deep-red growths of armor on the head, chest, arms, and legs.\r\n\u201CLet him go,\u201D Kaladin said, curious.\r\nTeft glanced at him, then reluctantly did as commanded. Shen scrambled over the uneven ground and gently, but firmly, pushed Kaladin away from the corpse. Shen stood back, as if protecting it from Kaladin.\r\n\u201CThis thing,\u201D Rock noted, stepping up beside Kaladin, \u201Che has done it before. When Lopen and I take him scavenging.\u201D\r\n\u201CHe\u2019s protective of the Parshendi bodies, gancho,\u201D Lopen added. \u201CLike he\u2019d stab you a hundred times for moving one, sure.\u201D\r\n\u201CThey\u2019re all like that,\u201D Sigzil said from behind.\r\nKaladin turned, raising an eyebrow.\r\n\u201CParshman workers,\u201D Sigzil explained. \u201CThey\u2019re allowed to care for their own dead; it\u2019s one of the few things they seem passionate about. They grow irate if anyone else handles the bodies. They wrap them in linen and carry them out into the wilderness and leave them on slabs of stone.\u201D\r\nKaladin regarded Shen.\r\nI wonder\u2026.\r\n\u201CScavenge from the Parshendi,\u201D Kaladin said to his men. \u201CTeft, you\u2019ll probably have to hold Shen the whole time. I can\u2019t have him trying to stop us.\u201D\r\nTeft shot Kaladin a suffering glance; he still thought they should set Shen at the front of the bridge and let him die. But he did as told, pushing Shen away and getting Moash\u2019s help to hold him.\r\n\u201CAnd men,\u201D Kaladin noted. \u201Cbe respectful of the dead.\u201D\r\n\u201CThey\u2019re Parshendi!\u201D Leyten objected.\r\n\u201CI know,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CBut it bothers Shen. He\u2019s one of us, so let\u2019s keep his irritation to a minimum.\u201D\r\nThe parshman lowered his arms reluctantly and let Teft and Moash pull him away. He seemed resigned. Parshmen were slow of thought. How much did Shen comprehend?\r\n\u201CDidn\u2019t you wish to find a bow?\u201D Sigzil asked, kneeling and slipping a horned Parshendi shortbow out from underneath a body. \u201CThe bowstring is gone.\u201D\r\n\u201CThere\u2019s another in this fellow\u2019s pouch,\u201D Maps said, pulling something out of another Parshendi corpse\u2019s belt pouch. \u201CMight still be good.\u201D\r\nKaladin accepted the weapon and string. \u201CDoes anyone know how to use one of these?\u201D\r\nThe bridgemen glanced at one another. Bows were useless for hunting most shellbeasts; slings worked far better. The bow was really only good for killing other men. Kaladin glanced at Teft, who shook his head. He hadn\u2019t been trained on a bow; neither had Kaladin.\r\n\u201CIs simple,\u201D Rock said, rolling over a Parshendi corpse, \u201Cput arrow on string. Point away from self. Pull very hard. Let go.\u201D\r\n\u201CI doubt it will be that easy,\u201D Kaladin said.\r\n\u201CWe barely have time to train the lads in the spear, Kaladin,\u201D Teft said. \u201CYou mean to teach some of them the bow as well? And without a teacher who can use one himself?\u201D\r\nKaladin didn\u2019t respond. He tucked the bow and string away in his bag, added a few arrows, then helped the others. An hour later, they marched through the chasms toward the ladder, their torches sputtering, dusk approaching. The darker it grew, the more unpleasant the chasms became. Shadows deepened, and distant sounds\u2014water dripping, rocks falling, wind calling\u2014took on an ominous cast. Kaladin rounded a corner, and a group of many-legged cremlings scuttling along the wall and slipped into a fissure.\r\nConversation was subdued, and Kaladin didn\u2019t take part. Occasionally, he glanced over his shoulder toward Shen. The silent parshman walked head down. Robbing the Parshendi corpses had seriously disturbed him.\r\nI can use that,Kaladin thought.\r\nBut dare I?It would be a risk. A great one. He had already been sentenced once for upsetting the balance of the chasm battles.\r\nFirst the spheres,he thought. Getting the spheres out would mean he might be able to get out other items. Eventually he saw a shadow above, spanning the chasm. They had reached the first of the permanent bridges. Kaladin walked with the others a little further, until they reached a place where the chasm floor was closer to the top of the plateaus above.\r\nHe stopped here. The bridgemen gathered around him.\r\n\u201CSigzil,\u201D Kaladin said, pointing. \u201CYou know something about bows. How hard do you think it would be to hit that bridge with an arrow?\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve occasionally held a bow, Kaladin, but I would not call myself an expert. It shouldn\u2019t be too hard, I\u2019d imagine. The distance is what, fifty feet?\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat\u2019s the point?\u201D Moash asked.\r\nKaladin pulled out the pouch full of spheres, then raised an eyebrow at them. \u201CWe tie the bag to the arrow, then launch it up so that it sticks to the bottom of the bridge. Then when we\u2019re on a bridge run, Lopen and Dabbid can hang back to get a drink near that bridge up there. They reach under the wood and pull the arrow off. We get the spheres.\u201D\r\nTeft whistled. \u201CClever.\u201D\r\n\u201CWe could get all of the spheres,\u201D Moash said eagerly. \u201CEven the\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D Kaladin said firmly. \u201CThe lesser ones will be dangerous enough; people might begin wondering where bridgemen are getting so much money.\u201D He would have to buy his supplies from several different apothecaries to hide his influx of money.\r\nMoash looked crestfallen, but the other bridgemen were eager. \u201CWho wants to try?\u201D Kaladin asked. \u201CMaybe we should shoot a few practice shots first, then try with the bag. Sigzil?\u201D\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know if I want this on me,\u201D Sigzil said. \u201CMaybe you should try, Teft.\u201D\r\nTeft rubbed his chin. \u201CSure. I guess. How hard can it be?\u201D\r\n\u201CHow hard?\u201D Rock asked suddenly.\r\nKaladin glanced to the side. Rock stood at the back of the group, though his height made him easy to see. He had his arms folded.\r\n\u201CHow hard, Teft?\u201D Rock continued. \u201CFifty feet is not too far, but is not easy shot. And to do it with bag of heavy spheres tied to it? Ha! You also need to get arrow close to side of bridge, so Lopen can reach. If you miss with this thing, you could lose all spheres. And what if scouts near bridges above see arrow come from chasm? Will think it suspicious, eh?\u201D\r\nKaladin eyed the Horneater.\r\nIs simple,he\u2019d said.\r\nPoint away from self\u2026let go\u2026\r\n\u201CWell,\u201D Kaladin said, watching Rock from the corner of his eye. \u201CI guess we\u2019ll just have to take that chance. Without these spheres, the wounded die.\u201D\r\n\u201CWe could wait until the next bridge run,\u201D Teft said. \u201CTie a rope to the bridge and toss it over, then tie the bag to it next time\u2026.\u201D\r\n\u201CFifty feet of rope?\u201D Kaladin said flatly. \u201CIt would draw enough attention to buy something like that.\u201D\r\n\u201CNah, gancho,\u201D Lopen said. \u201CI have a cousin who works in a place that sells rope. I could get some for you easy, with money.\u201D\r\n\u201CPerhaps,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CBut you\u2019d still have to hide it in the litter, then hang it down into the chasm without anyone seeing. And to leave it dangling there for several days? It would be noticed.\u201D\r\nThe others nodded. Rock seemed very uncomfortable. Sighing, Kaladin took out the bow and several arrows. \u201CWe\u2019ll just have to chance this. Teft, why don\u2019t you\u2026\u201D\r\n\u201COh, Kali\u2019kalin\u2019s ghost,\u201D Rock muttered. \u201CHere, give me bow.\u201D He shoved his way through the bridgemen, taking the bow from Kaladin. Kaladin hid a smile.\r\nRock glanced upward, judging the distance in the waning light. He strung the bowstring, then held out a hand. Kaladin handed him an arrow. He leveled the bow back down the chasm and launched. The arrow flew swiftly, clattering against chasm walls.\r\nRock nodded to himself, then pointed at Kaladin\u2019s pouch. \u201CWe take only five spheres,\u201D Rock said. \u201CAny more would be too heavy. Is crazy to try with even five. Airsick lowlanders.\u201D\r\nKaladin smiled, then counted out five sapphire marks\u2014together about two and a half months\u2019 worth of pay for a bridgeman\u2014and placed them in a spare pouch. He handed that to Rock, who pulled out a knife and dug a\u00A0notch into an arrow\u2019s wood next to the arrowhead.\r\nSkar folded his arms and leaned against the mossy wall. \u201CThis is stealing, you know.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D Kaladin said, watching Rock. \u201CAnd I don\u2019t feel the least bit bad about it. Do you?\u201D\r\n\u201CNot at all,\u201D Skar said, grinning. \u201CI figure once someone is trying to get you killed, all expectations of your loyalty are tossed to the storm. But if someone were to go to Gaz\u2026\u201D\r\nThe other bridgemen suddenly grew nervous, and more than a few eyes darted toward Shen, though Kaladin could see that Skar wasn\u2019t thinking of the Parshman. If one of the bridgemen were to betray the rest of them, he might earn himself a reward.\r\n\u201CMaybe we should post a watch,\u201D Drehy said. \u201CYou know, make sure nobody sneaks off to talk to Gaz.\u201D\r\n\u201CWe\u2019ll do no such thing,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CWhat are we going to do? Lock ourselves in the barrack, so suspicious of each other that we never get anything done?\u201D He shook his head. \u201CNo. This is just one more danger. It\u2019s a real one, but we can\u2019t waste energy spying on each other. So we keep on going.\u201D\r\nSkar didn\u2019t look convinced.\r\n\u201CWe\u2019re Bridge Four,\u201D Kaladin said firmly. \u201CWe\u2019ve faced death together. We have to trust each other. You can\u2019t run into battle wondering if your companions are going to switch sides suddenly.\u201D He met the eyes of each man in turn. \u201CI trust you. All of you. We\u2019ll make it through this, and we\u2019ll do it together.\u201D\r\nThere were several nods; Skar seemed placated. Rock finished his work cutting the arrow, then proceeded to tie the pouch tightly around the shaft.\r\nSyl still sat on Kaladin\u2019s shoulder. \u201CYou want me to watch the others? Make sure nobody does what Skar thinks they might?\u201D\r\nKaladin hesitated, then nodded. Best to be safe. He just didn\u2019t want the men to have to think that way.\r\nRock hefted the arrow, judging the weight. \u201CNear impossible shot,\u201D he complained. Then, in a smooth motion, he nocked the arrow and drew to his cheek, positioning himself directly beneath the bridge. The small pouch hung down, dangling against the wood of the arrow. The bridgemen held their breath.\r\nRock loosed. The arrow streaked up the side of the chasm wall, almost too fast to follow. A faint click sounded as arrow met wood, and Kaladin held his breath, but the arrow did not pull free. It remained hanging there, precious spheres tied to its shaft, right next to the side of the bridge where it could be reached.\r\nKaladin clapped Rock on the shoulder as the bridgemen cheered him.\r\nRock eyed Kaladin. \u201CI will not use bow to fight. You must know this thing.\u201D\r\n\u201CI promise,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CI\u2019ll take you if you agree, but I won\u2019t force you.\u201D\r\n\u201CI will not fight,\u201D Rock said. \u201CIs not my place.\u201D He glanced up at the spheres, then smiled faintly. \u201CBut shooting bridge is all right.\u201D\r\n\u201CHow did you learn?\u201D Kaladin asked.\r\n\u201CIs secret,\u201D Rock said firmly. \u201CTake bow. Bother me no more.\u201D\r\n\u201CAll right,\u201D Kaladin said, accepting the bow. \u201CBut I don\u2019t know if I can promise not to bother you. I may need a few more shots in the future.\u201D He eyed Lopen. \u201CYou really think you can buy some rope without drawing attention?\u201D\r\nLopen lounged back against the wall. \u201CMy cousin\u2019s never failed me.\u201D\r\n\u201CHow many cousins do you have, anyway?\u201D Earless Jaks asked.\r\n\u201CA man can never have enough cousins,\u201D Lopen said.\r\n\u201CWell, we need that rope,\u201D Kaladin said, the plan beginning to sprout in his mind. \u201CDo it, Lopen. I\u2019ll make change from those spheres above to pay for it.\u201D"

      "ChapterName": "56: THAT STORMING BOOK",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\n\u201CLight grows so distant. The storm never stops. I am broken, and all around me have died. I weep for the end of all things. He has won. Oh, he has beaten us.\u201D\r\n\u2014Dated Palahakev, 1173, 16 seconds pre-death. Subject: a Thaylen sailor.\r\nDalinar fought, the Thrill pulsing within him, swinging his Shardblade from atop Gallant\u2019s back. Around him, Parshendi fell with eyes burning black.\r\nThey came at him in pairs, each team trying to hit him from a different direction, keeping him busy and\u2014they hoped\u2014disoriented. If a pair could rush at him while he was distracted, they might be able to shove him off his mount. Those axes and maces\u2014swung repeatedly\u2014could crack his Plate. It was a very costly tactic; corpses lay scattered around Dalinar. But when fighting against a Shardbearer, every tactic was costly.\r\nDalinar kept Gallant moving, dancing from side to side, swinging his Blade in broad sweeps. He stayed just a little ahead of the line of his men. A Shardbearer needed space to fight; the Blades were so long that hurting one\u2019s companions was a very real danger. His honor guard would approach only if he fell or encountered trouble.\r\nThe Thrill excited him, strengthened him. He hadn\u2019t experienced the weakness again, the nausea he had on the battlefield that day weeks ago. Perhaps he\u2019d been worried about nothing.\r\nHe turned Gallant just in time to confront two pairs of Parshendi coming at him from behind, singing softly. He directed Gallant with his knees, performing an expert sweeping side-swing, cutting through the necks of two Parshendi, then the arm of a third. Eyes burned out in the first two, and they collapsed. The third dropped his weapon from a hand that grew suddenly lifeless, flopping down, its nerves all severed.\r\nThe fourth member of that squad scrambled away, glaring at Dalinar. This was one of the Parshendi who didn\u2019t wear a beard, and it seemed that there was something odd about his face. The cheek structure was just a little off\u2026.\r\nWas that a woman?Dalinar thought with amazement.\r\nIt couldn\u2019t have been. Could it?\r\nBehind him, his soldiers let out cheers as a large number of Parshendi scattered away to regroup. Dalinar lowered his Shardblade, the metal gleaming, gloryspren winking into the air around him. There was another reason for him to stay out ahead of his men. A Shardbearer wasn\u2019t just a force of destruction; he was a force of morale and inspiration. The men fought more vigorously as they saw their brightlord felling foe after foe. Shardbearers changed battles.\r\nSince the Parshendi were broken for the moment, Dalinar climbed free of Gallant and dropped to the rocks. Corpses lay unbloodied all around him, though once he approached the place where his men had been fighting, orange-red blood stained the rocks. Cremlings scuttled about on the ground, lapping up the liquid, and painspren wriggled between them. Wounded Parshendi lay staring up into the air, faces masks of pain, singing a quiet, haunting song to themselves. Often just as whispers. They never yelled as they died.\r\nDalinar felt the Thrill retreat as he joined his honor guard. \u201CThey\u2019re getting too close to Gallant,\u201D Dalinar said to Teleb, handing over the reins. The massive Ryshadium\u2019s coat was flecked with frothy sweat. \u201CI don\u2019t want to risk him. Have a man run him to the back lines.\u201D\r\nTeleb nodded, waving a soldier to obey the order. Dalinar hefted his Shardblade, scanning the battlefield. The Parshendi force was regrouping. As always, the two-person teams were the focus of their strategy. Each pair would have different weapons, and often one was clean-shaven while the other had a beard woven with gemstones. His scholars had suggested this was some kind of primitive apprenticeship.\r\nDalinar inspected the clean-shaven ones for signs of any stubble. There was none, and more than a few had a faintly feminine shape to their faces. Could the ones without beards all be women? They didn\u2019t appear to have much in the way of breasts, and their builds were like those of men, but the strange Parshendi armor could be masking things. The beardless ones\r\ndidseem smaller by a few fingers, and the shapes of the faces\u2026studying them, it seemed possible. Could the pairs be husbands and wives fighting together? That struck him as strangely fascinating. Was it possible that, despite six years of war, nobody had taken the time to investigate the genders of those they fought?\r\nYes. The contested plateaus were so far out, nobody ever brought back Parshendi bodies; they just set men to pulling the gemstones out of their beards or gathering their weapons. Since Gavilar\u2019s death, very little effort had been given to studying the Parshendi. Everyone just wanted them dead, and if there was one thing the Alethi were good at, it was killing.\r\nAndyou\u2019re\r\nsupposed to be killing them now,Dalinar told himself,\r\nnot analyzing their culture.But he did decide to have his soldiers collect a few bodies for the scholars.\r\nHe charged toward another section of the battlefield, Shardblade before him in two hands, making certain not to outpace his soldiers. To the south, he could see Adolin\u2019s banner flying as he led his division against the Parshendi there. The lad had been uncharacteristically reserved lately. Being wrong about Sadeas seemed to have made him more contemplative.\r\nOn the west side, Sadeas\u2019s own banner flew proudly, Sadeas\u2019s forces keeping the Parshendi from the chrysalis. He\u2019d arrived first, as before, engaging the Parshendi so Dalinar\u2019s companies could arrive. Dalinar had considered cutting out the gemheart so the Alethi could retreat, but why end the battle that quickly? He and Sadeas both felt the real point of their alliance was to crush as many Parshendi as possible.\r\nThe more they killed, the faster this war would be through. And so far, Dalinar\u2019s plan was working. The two armies complemented one another. Dalinar\u2019s assaults had been too slow, and he\u2019d allowed the Parshendi to position themselves too well. Sadeas was fast\u2014more so now that he could leave men behind and concentrate fully on speed\u2014and he was frighteningly effective at getting men onto the plateaus to fight, but his men weren\u2019t trained as well as Dalinar\u2019s. So if Sadeas could arrive first, then hold out long enough for Dalinar to get his men across, the superior training\u2014and superior Shards\u2014of his forces worked like a hammer against the Parshendi, smashing them against Sadeas\u2019s anvil.\r\nIt was still by no means easy. The Parshendi fought like chasmfiends.\r\nDalinar crashed against them, swinging out with his blade, slaying Parshendi on all sides. He couldn\u2019t help but feel a grudging respect for the Parshendi. Few men dared assault a Shardbearer directly\u2014at least not without the entire weight of their army forcing them forward, almost against their will.\r\nThese Parshendi attacked with bravery. Dalinar spun, laying about him, the Thrill surging within. With an ordinary sword, a fighter focused on controlling his blows, striking and expecting recoil. You wanted quick, rapid strikes with small arcs. A Shardblade was different. The Blade was enormous, yet remarkably light. There was never recoil; landing a blow felt nearly like passing the blade through the air itself. The trick was to control momentum and keep the blade moving.\r\nFour Parshendi threw themselves at him; they seemed to know that working into close quarters was one of the best ways to drop him. If they got too close, the length of his Blade\u2019s hilt and the nature of his armor would make fighting more difficult for him. Dalinar spun in a long, waist-high attack, and noted the deaths of Parshendi by the slight tug on the Blade as it passed through their chests. He got all four of them, and felt a surge of satisfaction.\r\nIt was followed immediately by nausea.\r\nDamnation!he thought.\r\nNot again!He turned toward another group of Parshendi as the eyes of the dead burned out and smoked.\r\nHe threw himself into another attack\u2014raising Blade in a twisting swing over his head, then bringing it down parallel to the ground. Six Parshendi died. He felt a spike of regret along with displeasure at the Thrill. Surely these Parshendi\u2014these soldiers\u2014deserved respect, not glee, as they were slaughtered.\r\nHe remembered the times when the Thrill had been the strongest. Subduing the highprinces with Gavilar during their youths, forcing back the Vedens, fighting the Herdazians and destroying the Akak Reshi. Once, the thirst for battle had nearly led him to attack Gavilar himself. Dalinar could remember the jealousy on that day some ten years ago, when the itch to attack Gavilar\u2014the only worthy opponent he could see, the man who had won Navani\u2019s hand\u2014had nearly consumed him.\r\nHis honor guard cheered as his foes dropped. He felt hollow, but he seized the Thrill and got a tight grip on his feelings and emotions. He let the Thrill pulse through him. Blessedly, the sickness went away, which was good, for another group of Parshendi charged him from the side. He executed a Windstance turn, shifting his feet, lowering his shoulder, and throwing his weight behind his Blade as he swung.\r\nHe got three in the sweep, but the fourth and final Parshendi shoved past his wounded comrades, getting inside Dalinar\u2019s reach, swinging his hammer. His eyes were wide with anger and determination, though he did not yell or bellow. He just continued his song.\r\nHis blow cracked into Dalinar\u2019s helm. It pushed his head to the side but the Plate absorbed most of the hit, a few tiny weblike lines cracking along its length. Dalinar could see them glowing faintly, releasing Stormlight at the edges of his vision.\r\nThe Parshendi was in too close. Dalinar dropped his Blade. The weapon puffed away to mist as Dalinar raised an armored arm and blocked the next hammer blow. Then he swung with his other arm, smashing his fist into the Parshendi\u2019s shoulder. The blow tossed the man to the ground. The Parshendi\u2019s song cut off. Gritting his teeth, Dalinar stepped up and kicked the man in the chest, throwing the body a good twenty feet through the air. He\u2019d learned to be wary of Parshendi who weren\u2019t fully incapacitated.\r\nDalinar lowered his hands and began to resummon his Shardblade. He felt strong again, passion for battle returning to him.\r\nI shouldn\u2019t feel bad for killing the Parshendi,he thought.\r\nThis is right.\r\nHe paused, noticing something. What was that on the next plateau over? It looked like\u2026\r\nLike a second Parshendi army.\r\nSeveral groups of his scouts were dashing toward the main battle lines, but Dalinar could guess the news they brought. \u201CStormfather!\u201D he cursed, pointing with his Shardblade. \u201CPass the warning! A second army approaches!\u201D\r\nSeveral men scattered in accordance to his command.\r\nWe should have expected this,Dalinar thought.\r\nWe started bringing two armies to a plateau, so they have done the same.\r\nBut that implied that they had limited themselves before. Did they do it because they realized that the battlefields left little room for maneuvering? Or was it for speed? But that didn\u2019t make sense\u2014the Alethi had to worry about bridges as choke points, slowing them more and more if they brought more troops. But the Parshendi could jump the chasms. So why commit fewer troops than their all?\r\nCurse it all,he thought with frustration.\r\nWe know so little about them!\r\nHe shoved his Shardblade into the rock beside him, placing it intentionally so that it didn\u2019t vanish. He began calling out orders. His honor guard formed around him, ushering in scouts and sending out runners. For a short time, he became a tactical general rather than an advance warrior.\r\nIt took time to change their battlefield strategy. An army was like a massive chull at times, lumbering along, slow to react. Before his orders could be executed, the new Parshendi force began crossing over onto the north side. That was where Sadeas was fighting. Dalinar couldn\u2019t get a good view, and scout reports were taking too long.\r\nHe glanced to the side; there was a tall rock formation nearby. It had uneven sides, making it look a little like a pile of boards stacked one atop another. He grabbed his Shardblade in the middle of a report and ran across the stony ground, smashing a few Rockbuds beneath his plated boots. The Cobalt Guard and the messengers followed quickly.\r\nAt the rock formation, Dalinar tossed his Blade aside, letting it dissolve to smoke. He threw himself up and grabbed the rock, scaling the formation. Seconds later, he heaved himself up onto its flat top.\r\nThe battlefield stretched out below him. The main Parshendi army was a mass of red and black at the center of the plateau, now pressed on two sides by the Alethi. Sadeas\u2019 bridge crews waited on a western plateau, ignored, while the new force of Parshendi crossed from the north onto the battlefield.\r\nStormfather, but they can jump,Dalinar thought, watching the Parshendi span the gap in powerful leaps. Six years of fighting had shown Dalinar that human soldiers\u2014particularly if lightly armored\u2014could outrun Parshendi troops if they had to go more than a few dozen yards. But those thick, powerful Parshendi legs could send them far when they leaped.\r\nNot a single Parshendi lost his footing as they crossed the chasm. They approached the chasm at a trot, then dashed with a burst of speed for about ten feet, launching themselves forward. The new force pushed south, directly into Sadeas\u2019s army. Raising a hand against the bright white sunlight, Dalinar found he could make out Sadeas\u2019s personal banner.\r\nIt was directly in the path of the oncoming Parshendi force; he tended to remain at the back of his armies, in a secure position. Now, that position suddenly became the front lines, and Sadeas\u2019s other troops were too slow to disengage and react. He didn\u2019t have any support.\r\nSadeas!Dalinar thought, stepping right up to the lip of the stone, his cape streaming behind him in the breeze.\r\nI need to send him my reserve spearmen\u2014\r\nBut no, they\u2019d be too slow.\r\nThe spearmen couldn\u2019t get to him. But someone mounted might be able to.\r\n\u201CGallant!\u201D Dalinar bellowed, throwing himself off the rock formation. He fell to the rocks below, Plate absorbing the shock as he hit, cracking the stone. Stormlight puffed up around him, rising from his armor, and the greaves cracked slightly.\r\nGallant pulled away from his minders, galloping across the stones at Dalinar\u2019s call. As the horse approached, Dalinar grabbed the saddle-holds and heaved himself up and into place. \u201CFollow if you can,\u201D he bellowed at his honor guard, \u201Cand send a runner to tell my son he now commands our army!\u201D\r\nDalinar reared Gallant and galloped alongside the perimeter of the battlefield. His guard called for their horses, but they\u2019d have difficulty keeping up with a Ryshadium.\r\nSo be it.\r\nFighting soldiers became a blur to Dalinar\u2019s right. He leaned low in the saddle, wind hissing as it blew over his Shardplate. He held a hand out and summoned Oathbringer. It dropped into his hand, steaming and frosted, as he turned Gallant around the western tip of the battlefield. By design, the original Parshendi army lay between his force and Sadeas\u2019s. He didn\u2019t have time to round them. So, taking a deep breath, Dalinar struck out through the middle of it. Their ranks were spread out because of how they fought.\r\nGallant galloped through them, and Parshendi threw themselves out of the massive stallion\u2019s way, cursing in their melodic language. Hooves beat a thunder upon the rocks; Dalinar urged Gallant on with his knees. They had to keep momentum. Some Parshendi fighting on the front against Sadeas\u2019s force turned and ran at him. They saw the opportunity. If Dalinar fell, he\u2019d land alone, surrounded by thousands of enemies.\r\nDalinar\u2019s heart thumped as he held his Blade out, trying to swipe at Parshendi who came too close. Within minutes, he approached the northwestern Parshendi line. There, his enemies formed up, raising spears and setting them against the ground.\r\nBlast!Dalinar thought. Parshendi had never set spears like that against heavy cavalry before. They were starting to learn.\r\nDalinar charged the formation, then wheeled Gallant at the last moment, turning parallel to the Parshendi spear wall. He swung his Shardblade out to the side, shearing the tips from their weapons and hitting a few arms. A patch of Parshendi just ahead wavered, and Dalinar took a deep breath, urging Gallant directly into them, shearing off a few spear tips. Another one bounced off his shoulder armor, and Gallant took a long gash on the left flank.\r\nTheir momentum carried them forward, trampling over the Parshendi, and with a whinny, Gallant burst free of the Parshendi line just to the side of where Sadeas\u2019s main force was engaging the enemy.\r\nDalinar\u2019s heart pumped. He passed Sadeas\u2019s force in a blur, galloping toward the back lines, where a churning, disorganized chaos of men tried to react to the new Parshendi force. Men screamed and died, a mess of forest green Alethi and Parshendi in black and red.\r\nThere!Dalinar saw Sadeas\u2019s banner flap for a moment before falling. He threw himself from Gallant\u2019s saddle and hit the stones. The horse turned away, understanding. His wound was bad, and Dalinar would not risk him any further.\r\nIt was time for the slaughter to begin again.\r\nHe tore into the Parshendi force from the side, and some turned, looks of surprise in their usually stoic black eyes. At times the Parshendi seemed alien, but their emotions were so human. The Thrill rose and Dalinar did not force it down. He needed it too much. An ally was in danger.\r\nIt was time to let the Blackthorn loose.\r\nDalinar punched through the Parshendi ranks. He felled Parshendi like a man sweeping crumbs from the table after a meal. There was no controlled precision here, no careful engagement of a few squads with his honor guard at the back. This was a full-out attack, with all the power and deadly force of a life-long killer enhanced by Shards. He was like a tempest, slashing through legs, torsos, arms, necks, killing, killing, killing. He was a maelstrom of death and steel. Weapons bounced off his armor, leaving tiny cracks. He killed dozens, always moving, forcing his way toward where Sadeas\u2019s banner had fallen.\r\nEyes burned, swords flashed in the sky, and Parshendi sang. The close press of their own troops\u2014bunching up as they hit Sadeas\u2019s line\u2014inhibited them. But not Dalinar. He didn\u2019t have to worry about striking friends, nor did he have to worry about his weapon getting caught in flesh or stuck in armor. And if corpses got in his way, he sheared through them\u2014dead flesh would cut like steel and wood.\r\nSoon, Parshendi blood splashed in the air as he killed, then hacked, then shoved his way through the press. Blade from shoulder to side, back and forth, occasionally turning to sweep at those trying to kill him from behind.\r\nHe stumbled on a swath of green cloth. Sadeas\u2019s banner. Dalinar spun, searching. Behind him, he\u2019d left a line of corpses that was quickly yet carefully being stepped past by more Parshendi focused on him. Except just to his left. None of the Parshendi there turned toward him.\r\nSadeas!Dalinar thought, leaping forward, cutting down Parshendi from behind. That revealed a group of them bunched in a circle, beating on something below them. Something leaking Stormlight.\r\nJust to the side lay a large Shardbearer\u2019s hammer, fallen where Sadeas had apparently dropped it. Dalinar leaped forward, dropping his Blade and grabbing the hammer. He roared as he slammed it into the group, tossing a dozen Parshendi away from him, then turned and swung again on the other side. Bodies sprayed into the air, hurled backward.\r\nThe hammer worked better in such close quarters; the Blade would simply have killed the men, dropping their corpses to the ground, leaving him still pressed and pinned. The hammer, however, flung the bodies away. He leaped into the middle of the area he\u2019d just cleared, positioning himself with one foot on either side of the fallen Sadeas. He began the process of summoning his Blade again and laid about him with the hammer, scattering his enemies.\r\nAt the ninth beat of his heart, he threw the hammer into the face of a Parshendi, then let Oathbringer reform in his hands. He fell immediately into Windstance, glancing downward. Sadeas\u2019s armor leaked Stormlight from a dozen different breaks and rifts. The breastplate had been shattered completely; broken, jagged bits of metal jutted out, revealing the uniform underneath. Wisps of radiant smoke trailed from the holes.\r\nThere was no time to check if he still lived. The Parshendi now saw not one, but two Shardbearers within their grasp, and they threw themselves at Dalinar. Warrior after warrior fell as Dalinar slaughtered them in sweeps, protecting the space just around him.\r\nHe couldn\u2019t stop them all. His armor took hits, mostly on the arms and back. The armor cracked, like a crystal under too much stress.\r\nHe roared, striking down four Parshendi as two more hit him from behind, making his armor vibrate. He spun and killed one, the other barely dancing out of range. Dalinar began to pant, and when he moved quickly, he left trails of blue Stormlight in the air. He felt like a bloodied prey beast trying to fend off a thousand different snapping predators at once.\r\nBut he was no chull, whose only protection was to hide. He killed, and the Thrill rose to a crescendo within him. He sensed real danger, a chance of falling, and that made the Thrill surge. He nearly choked on it, the joy, the pleasure, the desire. The danger. More and more blows got through; more and more Parshendi were able to duck or dodge out of the way of his Blade.\r\nHe felt a breeze through the back of his breastplate. Cooling, terrible, frightening. The cracks were widening. If the breastplate burst\u2026\r\nHe screamed, slamming his blade down through a Parshendi, burning out his eyes, dropping the man without a mark on his skin. Dalinar brought his Blade up, spinning, cutting through the legs of another foe. His insides were a tempest of emotions, and his brow beneath the helm streamed with sweat. What would happen to the Alethi army if both he and Sadeas fell here? Two highprinces dead in the same battle, two sets of Plate and one Blade lost?\r\nIt couldn\u2019t happen. He wouldn\u2019t fall here. He didn\u2019t yet know if he was mad or not. He couldn\u2019t die until he knew!\r\nSuddenly, a wave of Parshendi died that he hadn\u2019t attacked. A figure in brilliant blue Shardplate burst through them. Adolin held his massive Shardblade in a single hand, the metal gleaming.\r\nAdolin swung again, and the Cobalt Guard rushed forward, pouring into the gap Adolin created. The Parshendi song changed tempo, becoming frantic, and they fell back as more and more troops punched through, some in green, others in blue.\r\nDalinar knelt down, exhausted, letting his Blade vanish. His guard surrounded him, and Adolin\u2019s army washed over them all, overrunning the Parshendi, forcing them back. In a few minutes, the area was secure.\r\nThe danger was past.\r\n\u201CFather,\u201D Adolin said, kneeling beside him, pulling his helm off. The youth\u2019s blond and black hair was disheveled and sweat-slick. \u201CStorms! You gave me a fright! Are you well?\u201D\r\nDalinar pulled his own helm free, sweet cooling air washing across his damp face. He took a deep breath, then nodded. \u201CYour timing is\u2026quite good, son.\u201D\r\nAdolin helped Dalinar back to his feet. \u201CI had to punch through the entire Parshendi army. No disrespect, Father, but what in the storms made you pull a stunt like that?\u201D\r\n\u201CThe knowledge that you could handle the army if I fell,\u201D Dalinar said, clapping his son on the arm, their Plate clinking.\r\nAdolin caught sight of the back of Dalinar\u2019s Shardplate, and his eyes opened wide.\r\n\u201CBad?\u201D Dalinar asked.\r\n\u201CLooks like it\u2019s held together with spit and twine,\u201D Adolin said. \u201CYou\u2019re leaking Light like a wineskin used for archery practice.\u201D\r\nDalinar nodded, sighing. Already his Plate was feeling sluggish. He\u2019d probably have to remove it before they returned to the camp, lest it freeze on him.\r\nTo the side, several soldiers were pulling Sadeas free of his Plate. It was so far gone that the Light had stopped save for a few tiny wisps. It could be fixed, but it would be expensive\u2014regenerating Shardplate generally shattered the gemstones it drew Light from.\r\nThe soldiers pulled Sadeas\u2019s helm off, and Dalinar was relieved to see his former friend blinking, looking disoriented but largely uninjured. He had a cut on his thigh where one of the Parshendi had gotten him with a sword, and a few scrapes on his chest.\r\nSadeas looked up at Dalinar and Adolin. Dalinar stiffened, expecting recrimination\u2014this had only happened because Dalinar had insisted on fighting with two armies on the same plateau. That had goaded the Parshendi into bringing another army. Dalinar should have set proper scouts to watch for that.\r\nSadeas, however, smiled a wide grin. \u201CStormfather, but that was close! How goes the battle?\u201D\r\n\u201CThe Parshendi are routed,\u201D Adolin said. \u201CThe last force resisting was the one around you. Our men are cutting the gemheart free at this moment. The day is ours.\u201D\r\n\u201CWe win again!\u201D Sadeas said triumphantly. \u201CDalinar, once in a while, it appears that senile old brain of yours can come up with a good idea or two!\u201D\r\n\u201CWe\u2019re the same age, Sadeas.\u201D Dalinar noted as messengers approached, bearing reports from the rest of the battlefield.\r\n\u201CSpread the word,\u201D Sadeas proclaimed. \u201CTonight, all my soldiers will feast as if they were lighteyes!\u201D He smiled as his soldiers helped him to his feet, and Adolin moved over to take the scout reports. Sadeas waved away the help insisting he could stand despite his wound, and began calling for his officers.\r\nDalinar turned to seek out Gallant and make sure the horse\u2019s wound was cared for. As he did, however, Sadeas caught his arm.\r\n\u201CI should be dead,\u201D Sadeas said softly.\r\n\u201CPerhaps.\u201D\r\n\u201CI didn\u2019t see much. But I thought I saw you alone. Where was your honor guard?\u201D\r\n\u201CI had to leave it behind,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CIt was the only way to get to you in time.\u201D\r\nSadeas frowned. \u201CThat was a terrible risk, Dalinar. Why?\u201D\r\n\u201CYou do not abandon your allies on the battlefield. Not unless there\u2019s no recourse. It is one of the Codes.\u201D\r\nSadeas shook his head. \u201CThat honor of yours is going to get you killed, Dalinar.\u201D He seemed bemused. \u201CNot that I feel like offering a complaint about it this day!\u201D\r\n\u201CIf I should die,\u201D Dalinar said, \u201Cthen I would do so having lived my life right. It is not the destination that matters, but how one arrives there.\u201D\r\n\u201CThe Codes?\u201D\r\n\u201CNo.\r\nThe Way of Kings.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat storming book.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat storming book saved your life today, Sadeas,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CI think I\u2019m starting to understand what Gavilar saw in it.\u201D\r\nSadeas scowled at that, though he glanced at his armor, lying in pieces nearby. He shook his head. \u201CPerhaps I shall let you tell me what you mean. I\u2019d like to understand you again, old friend. I\u2019m beginning to wonder if I ever really did.\u201D He let go of Dalinar\u2019s arm. \u201CSomeone bring me my storming horse! Where are my officers?\u201D\r\nDalinar left, and quickly found several members of his guard seeing to Gallant. As he joined them, he was struck by the sheer number of corpses on the ground. They ran in a line where he had punched through the Parshendi ranks to get to Sadeas, a trail of death.\r\nHe looked back to where he\u2019d made his stand. Dozens dead. Perhaps hundreds.\r\nBlood of my fathers,Dalinar thought.\r\nDid I do that?He hadn\u2019t killed in such numbers since the early days of helping Gavilar unite Alethkar. And he hadn\u2019t grown sick at the sight of death since his youth.\r\nYet now he found himself revolted, barely able to keep his stomach under control. He would not retch on the battlefield. His men should not see that.\r\nHe stumbled away, one hand to his head, the other carrying his helm. He should be exulting. But he couldn\u2019t. He just\u2026couldn\u2019t.\r\nYou will need luck trying to understand me, Sadeas,he thought.\r\nBecause I\u2019m having Damnation\u2019s own trouble trying to do so myself."

      "ChapterName": "57: WANDERSAIL",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\n\u201CI hold the suckling child in my hands, a knife at his throat, and know that all who live wish me to let the blade slip. Spill its blood upon the ground, over my hands, and with it gain us further breath to draw.\u201D\r\n\u2014Dated Shashanan, 1173, 23 seconds pre-death. Subject: a darkeyed youth of sixteen years. Sample is of particular note.\r\n\u201CAnd all the world was shattered!\u201D Maps yelled, back arching, eyes wide, flecks of red spittle on his cheeks. \u201CThe rocks trembled with their steps, and the stones reached toward the heavens. We die! We die!\u201D\r\nHe spasmed one last time, and the light faded from his eyes. Kaladin sat back, crimson blood slick on his hands, the dagger he\u2019d been using as a surgical knife slipping from his fingers and clicking softly against the stone. The affable man lay dead on the stones of a plateau, arrow wound in his left breast open to the air, splitting the birthmark he\u2019d claimed looked like Alethkar.\r\nIt\u2019s taking them,Kaladin thought.\r\nOne by one. Open them up, bleed them out. We\u2019re nothing more than pouches to carry blood. Then we die, rain it down on the stones like a highstorm\u2019s floods.\r\nUntil only I remain. I always remain.\r\nA layer of skin, a layer of fat, a layer of muscle, a layer of bone. That was what men were.\r\nThe battle raged across the chasm. It might as well have been another kingdom, for all the attention anyone gave the bridgemen. Die die die, then get out of our way.\r\nThe members of Bridge Four stood in a solemn ring around Kaladin. \u201CWhat was that he said at the end?\u201D Skar asked. \u201CThe rocks trembled?\u201D\r\n\u201CIt was nothing,\u201D said thick-armed Yake. \u201CJust dying delirium. It happens to men, sometimes.\u201D\r\n\u201CMore often lately, it seems,\u201D Teft said. He held his hand to his arm, where he\u2019d hastily wrapped a bandage around an arrow wound. He wouldn\u2019t be carrying a bridge anytime soon. Maps\u2019s death and Arik\u2019s death left them with only twenty-six members now. It was barely enough to carry a\u00A0bridge. The greater heaviness was very noticeable, and they had difficulty keeping up with the other bridge crews. A few more losses, and they\u2019d be in serious trouble.\r\nI should have been faster,Kaladin thought, looking down at Maps splayed open, his insides exposed for the sun to dry. The arrowhead had pierced his lung and lodged in his spine. Could Lirin have saved him? If Kaladin had studied in Kharbranth as his father had wished, would he have learned enough\u2014known enough\u2014to prevent deaths like this?\r\nThis happens sometimes, son\u2026.\r\nKaladin raised shaking bloody hands to his face, gripping his head, as memory consumed him. A young girl, a cracked head, a broken leg, an angry father.\r\nDespair, hate, loss, frustration, horror. How could any man live this way? To be a surgeon, to live knowing that you would be too weak to save some? When other men failed, a field of crops got worms in them. When a surgeon failed, someone died.\r\nYou have to learn when to care\u2026.\r\nAs if he could choose. Banish it, like snuffing a lantern. Kaladin bowed beneath the weight.\r\nI should have saved him, I should have saved him, I should have saved him.\r\nMaps, Dunny, Amark, Goshel, Dallet, Nalma. Tien.\r\n\u201CKaladin.\u201D Syl\u2019s voice. \u201CBe strong.\u201D\r\n\u201CIf I were strong,\u201D he hissed, \u201Cthey would live.\u201D\r\n\u201CThe other bridgemen still need you. You promised them, Kaladin. You\u00A0gave your oath.\u201D\r\nKaladin looked up. The bridgemen seemed anxious and worried. There were only eight of them; Kaladin had sent the others to look for fallen bridgemen from other crews. They\u2019d found three initially, minor wounds that Skar could care for. No runners had come for him. Either the bridge crews had no other wounded, or those wounded were beyond help.\r\nMaybe he should have gone to look, just in case. But\u2014numb\u2014he could not face yet another dying man he could not save. He stumbled to his feet and walked away from the corpse. He stepped up to the chasm and forced himself to fall into the old stance Tukks had taught him.\r\nFeet apart, hands behind his back, clasping forearms. Straight-backed, staring forward. The familiarity brought him strength.\r\nYou were wrong, Father,he thought.\r\nYou said I\u2019d learn to deal with the deaths. And yet here I am. Years later. Same problem.\r\nThe bridgemen fell in around him. Lopen approached with a waterskin. Kaladin hesitated, then accepted the skin, washing off his face and hands. The warm water splashed across his skin, then brought welcome coolness as it evaporated. He let out a deep breath, nodding thanks to the short Herdazian man.\r\nLopen raised an eyebrow, then gestured to the pouch tied to his waist. He had recovered the newest pouch of spheres they\u2019d stuck to the bridge with an arrow. This was the fourth time they\u2019d done that, and had recovered them each without incident.\r\n\u201CDid you have any trouble?\u201D Kaladin asked.\r\n\u201CNo, gancho,\u201D Lopen said, smiling widely. \u201CEasy as tripping a Horneater.\u201D\r\n\u201CI heard that,\u201D Rock said gruffly, standing in parade rest a short distance away.\r\n\u201CAnd the rope?\u201D Kaladin asked.\r\n\u201CI dropped the whole coil right over the side,\u201D Lopen said. \u201CBut I didn\u2019t tie the end to anything. Just like you said.\u201D\r\n\u201CGood,\u201D Kaladin said. A rope dangling from a bridge would have just been too obvious. If Hashal or Gaz caught scent of what Kaladin was planning\u2026\r\nAnd whereis\r\nGaz?Kaladin thought.\r\nWhy didn\u2019t he come on the bridge run?\r\nLopen gave Kaladin the pouch of spheres, as if eager to be rid of the responsibility. Kaladin accepted it, stuffing it into his trouser pocket.\r\nLopen retreated, and Kaladin fell back into parade rest. The plateau on the other side of the chasm was long and thin, with steep slopes on the sides. Just as in the last few battles, Dalinar Kholin helped Sadeas\u2019s force. He always arrived late. Perhaps he blamed his slow, chull-pulled bridges. Very convenient. His men often had the luxury of crossing without archery fire.\r\nSadeas and Dalinar won more battles this way. Not that it mattered to the bridgemen.\r\nMany people were dying on the other side of the chasm, but Kaladin didn\u2019t feel a thing for them. No itch to heal them, no desire to help. Kaladin could thank Hav for that, for training him to think in terms of \u201Cus\u201D and \u201Cthem.\u201D In a way, Kaladin\r\nhadlearned what his father had talked about. In the wrong way, but it was something. Protect the \u201Cus,\u201D destroy the \u201Cthem.\u201D A soldier had to think like that. So Kaladin hated the Parshendi. They were the enemy. If he hadn\u2019t learned to divide his mind like that, war would have destroyed him.\r\nPerhaps it had done so anyway.\r\nAs he watched the battle, he focused on one thing in particular to distract himself. How\r\ndidthe Parshendi treat their dead? Their actions seemed irregular. The Parshendi soldiers rarely disturbed their dead after they fell; they\u2019d take roundabout paths of attack to avoid dead bodies. And when the Alethi marched over the Parshendi dead, they formed points of terrible conflict.\r\nDid the Alethi notice? Probably not. But he could see that the Parshendi revered their dead\u2014revered them to the extent that they would endanger the living to preserve the corpses of the fallen. Kaladin could use that. He would use that. Somehow.\r\nThe Alethi eventually won the battle. Before long, Kaladin and his team were slogging back across the plateau, carrying their bridge, three wounded lashed to the top. They had found only those three, and a part of Kaladin felt sick inside as he realized another part of him was glad. He had already rescued some fifteen men from other bridge crews, and it was straining their resources\u2014even with the money from the pouches\u2014to feed them. Their barrack was crowded with the wounded.\r\nBridge Four reached a chasm, and Kaladin moved to lower his burden. The process was rote to him now. Lower the bridge, quickly untie the wounded, push the bridge across the chasm. Kaladin checked on the three wounded. Every man he rescued this way seemed bemused at what he\u2019d done, even though he\u2019d been doing it for weeks now. Satisfied that they were all right, he moved to stand at parade rest while the soldiers crossed.\r\nBridge Four fell in around him. Increasingly, they earned scowls from the soldiers\u2014both darkeyed and lighteyed\u2014who crossed. \u201CWhy do they do that?\u201D Moash said quietly as a passing soldier tossed an overripe pile-vine fruit at the bridgemen. Moash wiped the stringy, red fruit from his face, then sighed and fell back into his stance. Kaladin had never asked them to join him, but they did it each time.\r\n\u201CWhen I fought in Amaram\u2019s army,\u201D Kaladin said, \u201CI dreamed about joining the troops at the Shattered Plains. Everyone knew that the soldiers left in Alethkar were the dregs. We imagined the real soldiers, off fighting in the glorious war to bring retribution to those who had killed our king. Those soldiers would treat their fellows with fairness. Their discipline would be firm. Each would be an expert with the spear, and he would not break rank on the battlefield.\u201D\r\nTo the side, Teft snorted quietly.\r\nKaladin turned to Moash. \u201CWhy do they treat us so, Moash? Because they know they should be better than they are. Because they see discipline in bridgemen, and it embarrasses them. Rather than bettering themselves, they take the easier road of jeering at us.\u201D\r\n\u201CDalinar Kholin\u2019s soldiers don\u2019t act like that,\u201D Skar said from just behind Kaladin. \u201CHis men march in straight ranks. There is order in their camp. If they\u2019re on duty, they don\u2019t leave their coats unbuttoned or lounge about.\u201D\r\nWill I never stop hearing about Dalinar storming Kholin?Kaladin thought.\r\nMen had spoken that way of Amaram. How easy it was to ignore a blackened heart if you dressed it in a pressed uniform and a reputation for honesty.\r\nSeveral hours later, the sweaty and exhausted group of bridgemen tramped up the incline to the lumberyard. They dumped their bridge in its resting place. It was getting late; Kaladin would have to purchase food immediately if they were going to have supplies for the evening stew. He wiped his hands on his towel as the members of Bridge Four lined up.\r\n\u201CYou\u2019re dismissed for evening activities,\u201D he said. \u201CWe have chasm duty early tomorrow. Morning bridge practice will have to be moved to late afternoon.\u201D\r\nThe bridgemen nodded, then Moash raised a hand. As one, the bridgemen raised their arms and crossed them, wrists together, hands in fists. It had the look of a practiced effort. After that, they trotted away.\r\nKaladin raised an eyebrow, tucking his towel into his belt. Teft hung back, smiling.\r\n\u201CWhat was that?\u201D Kaladin asked.\r\n\u201CThe men wanted a salute,\u201D Teft said. \u201CWe can\u2019t use a regular military salute\u2014not with the spearmen already thinking we\u2019re too bigheaded. So I taught them my old squad salute.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhen?\u201D\r\n\u201CThis morning. While you were getting our schedule from Hashal.\u201D\r\nKaladin smiled. Odd, how he could still do that. Nearby, the other nineteen bridge crews on today\u2019s run dropped off their bridges, one by one. Had Bridge Four once looked like them, with those ragged beards and haunted expressions? None of them spoke to one another. Some few glanced at Kaladin as they passed, but they looked down as soon as they saw he was watching. They\u2019d stopped treating Bridge Four with the contempt they\u2019d once shown. Curiously, they now seemed to regard Kaladin\u2019s crew as they did everyone else in camp\u2014as people above them. They hastened to avoid his notice.\r\nPoor sodden fools,Kaladin thought. Could he, maybe, persuade Hashal to let him take a few into Bridge Four? He could the use extra men, and seeing those slumped figures twisted his heart.\r\n\u201CI know that look, lad,\u201D Teft said. \u201CWhy is it you always have to help everyone?\u201D\r\n\u201CBah,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CI can\u2019t even protect Bridge Four. Here, let me look at that arm of yours.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s not that bad.\u201D\r\nKaladin grabbed his arm anyway, peeling away the blood-crusted bandage. The cut was long, but shallow.\r\n\u201CWe need antiseptic on this,\u201D Kaladin said, noting a few red rotspren crawling around on the wound. \u201CI should probably sew it up.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s not that bad!\u201D\r\n\u201CStill,\u201D Kaladin said, waving for Teft to follow as he approached one of the rain barrels alongside the lumberyard. The wound was shallow enough that Teft would probably be able to show the others spear thrusts and blocks tomorrow during chasm duty, but that was no excuse for leaving it alone to fester or scar.\r\nAt the rain barrel, Kaladin washed out the wound, then called for Lopen\u2014who was standing in the shade beside the barrack\u2014to bring his medical equipment. The Herdazian man gave that salute again, though he did it with one arm, and sauntered away to get the pack.\r\n\u201CSo, lad,\u201D Teft said. \u201CHow do you feel? Any odd experiences lately?\u201D\r\nKaladin frowned, looking up from the arm. \u201CStorm it, Teft! That\u2019s the fifth time in two days you\u2019ve asked me that. What are you getting at?\u201D\r\n\u201CNothing, nothing!\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\r\nissomething,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CWhat is it you\u2019re digging for, Teft? I\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CGancho,\u201D Lopen said, walking up, carrying the medical supply pack over his shoulder. \u201CHere you go.\u201D\r\nKaladin glanced at him, then reluctantly accepted the pack. He pulled the drawstrings open. \u201CWe\u2019ll want to\u2014\u201D\r\nA quick motion came from Teft. Like a punch being thrown.\r\nKaladin moved by reflex, taking in a sharp breath, moving to a defensive stance, arms up, one hand a fist, the other back to block.\r\nSomething blossomed within Kaladin. Like a deep breath drawn in, like a burning liquor injected directly into his blood. A powerful wave pulsed through his body. Energy, strength, awareness. It was like the body\u2019s natural alert response to danger, only it was a hundredfold more intense.\r\nKaladin caught Teft\u2019s fist, moving blurringly quick. Teft froze.\r\n\u201CWhat are you doing?\u201D Kaladin demanded.\r\nTeft was smiling. He stepped back, pulling his fist free. \u201CKelek,\u201D he said, shaking his hand. \u201CThat\u2019s some grip you\u2019ve got.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhy did you try to strike me?\u201D\r\n\u201CI wanted to see something,\u201D Teft said. \u201CYou\u2019re holding that pouch of spheres Lopen gave you, you see, and your own pouch with what we\u2019ve gathered lately. More Stormlight than you\u2019ve probably ever carried, at least recently.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat does that have to do with anything?\u201D Kaladin demanded. What was that heat inside of him, that burning in his veins?\r\n\u201CGancho,\u201D Lopen said, his voice awed. \u201CYou\u2019re glowing.\u201D\r\nKaladin frowned.\r\nWhat is he\u2014\r\nAnd then he noticed it. It was very faint, but it was there, wisps of luminescent smoke curling up from his skin. Like steam coming off a bowl of hot water on a cold winter night.\r\nShaking, Kaladin put the medical pack on the broad rim of the water barrel. He felt a moment of coldness on his skin. What was that? Shocked, he raised his other hand, looking at the wisps streaming off of it.\r\n\u201CWhat did you do to me?\u201D he demanded, looking up at Teft.\r\nThe older bridgeman was still smiling.\r\n\u201CAnswer me!\u201D Kaladin said, stepping forward, grabbing the front of Teft\u2019s shirt.\r\nStormfather, but I feel strong!\r\n\u201CI didn\u2019t do anything, lad,\u201D Teft said. \u201CYou\u2019ve been doing this for a while now. I caught you feeding off Stormlight when you were sick.\u201D\r\nStormlight. Kaladin hastily released Teft, fishing at the pouch of spheres in his pocket. He yanked it free and pulled it open.\r\nIt was dark inside. All five gemstones had been drained. The white light streaming from Kaladin\u2019s skin faintly illuminated the inside of the bag.\r\n\u201CNow that\u2019s something,\u201D Lopen said from the side. Kaladin spun to find the Herdazian man bending down and looking at the medical pack. Why was that so important?\r\nThen Kaladin saw it. He thought he\u2019d set the pack on the rim of the barrel, but in his haste he\u2019d just pressed it against the side of the barrel. The pack now clung to the wood. Stuck there, hanging as if from an invisible hook. Faintly streaming light, just like Kaladin. As Kaladin watched, the light faded, and the pack slumped free and fell to the ground.\r\nKaladin raised a hand to his forehead, looking from the surprised Lopen to the curious Teft. Then he glanced around the lumberyard, frantic. Nobody else was looking at them; in the sunlight, the vapors were too faint to see from a distance.\r\nStormfather\u2026what\u2026how\u2026\r\nHe caught sight of a familiar shape above. Syl moved like a blown leaf, tossed this way and that, leisurely, faint.\r\nShe did it!Kaladin thought.\r\nWhat has she done to me?\r\nHe stumbled away from Lopen and Teft, running toward Syl. His footsteps propelling him forward with too much speed. \u201CSyl!\u201D he bellowed, stopping beneath her.\r\nShe zipped down to hover before him, changing from a leaf to a young woman standing in the air. \u201CYes?\u201D\r\nKaladin glanced around. \u201CCome with me,\u201D he said, hurrying to one of the alleys between barracks. He pressed himself up against a wall, standing in the shade, breathing in and out. Nobody could see him here.\r\nSyl alighted in the air before him, hands behind her back, looking closely at him. \u201CYou\u2019re glowing.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat have you done to me?\u201D\r\nShe cocked her head, then shrugged.\r\n\u201CSyl\u2026\u201D he said threateningly, though he wasn\u2019t certain what harm he could do a spren.\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know, Kaladin,\u201D she said frankly, sitting down, her legs hanging over the side of the invisible platform. \u201CI can\u2026I can only faintly remember things I used to know so well. This world, interacting with men.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut you did do something.\u201D\r\n\u201C\r\nWehave done something. It wasn\u2019t me. It wasn\u2019t you. But together\u2026\u201D She shrugged again.\r\n\u201CThat isn\u2019t very helpful.\u201D\r\nShe grimaced. \u201CI know. I\u2019m sorry.\u201D\r\nKaladin raised a hand. In the shade, the light streaming off of him was more obvious. If someone walked by\u2026\u201CHow do I get rid of it?\u201D\r\n\u201CWhy do you want to get rid of it?\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, because\u2026I\u2026Because.\u201D\r\nSyl didn\u2019t respond.\r\nSomething occurred to Kaladin. Something, perhaps, he should have asked long ago. \u201CYou\u2019re not a windspren, are you?\u201D\r\nShe hesitated, then shook her head. \u201CNo.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat are you, then?\u201D\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know. I bind things.\u201D\r\nBind things. When she played pranks, she made items stick together. Shoes stuck to the ground and made men trip. People reached for their jackets hanging on hooks and couldn\u2019t pull them free. Kaladin reached down, picking a stone up off the ground. It was as big as his palm, weathered smooth by highstorm winds and rain. He pressed it against the wall of the barrack and willed his Light into the stone.\r\nHe felt a chill. The rock began to stream with luminescent vapors. When Kaladin pulled his hand away, the stone remained where it was, clinging to the side of the building.\r\nKaladin leaned close, squinting. He thought he could faintly make out tiny spren, dark blue and shaped like little splashes of ink, clustering around the place where the rock met the wall.\r\n\u201CBindspren,\u201D Syl said, walking up beside his head; she was still standing in the air.\r\n\u201CThey\u2019re holding the rock in place.\u201D\r\n\u201CMaybe. Or maybe they\u2019re attracted to what you\u2019ve done in affixing the stone there.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s not how it works. Is it?\u201D\r\n\u201CDo rotspren cause sickness,\u201D Syl said idly, \u201Cor are they attracted to it?\u201D\r\n\u201CEveryone knows they cause it.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd do windspren cause the wind? Rainspren cause the rain? Flamespren cause fires?\u201D\r\nHe hesitated. No, they didn\u2019t. Did they? \u201CThis is pointless. I need to find out how to get rid of this light, not study it.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd\r\nwhy,\u201D Syl repeated, \u201Cmust you get rid of it? Kaladin, you\u2019ve heard the stories. Men who walked on walls, men who bound the storms to them. Windrunners. Why would you want to be rid of something like this?\u201D\r\nKaladin struggled to define it. The healing, the way he never got hit, running at the front of the bridge\u2026Yes, he\u2019d known something odd was happening. Why did it frighten him so? Was it because he feared being set apart, like his father always was as the surgeon in Hearthstone? Or was it something greater?\r\n\u201CI\u2019m doing what the Radiants did,\u201D he said.\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s what I just said.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve been wondering if I\u2019m bad luck, or if I\u2019ve run afoul of something like the Old Magic. Maybe this explains it! The Almighty cursed the Lost Radiants for betraying mankind. What if I\u2019m cursed too, because of what I\u2019m doing?\u201D\r\n\u201CKaladin,\u201D she said, \u201Cyou are\r\nnotcursed.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou just said you don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening.\u201D He paced in the alleyway. To the side, the rock finally plopped free and clattered to the ground. \u201CCan you say, with all certainty, that what I\u2019m doing might not have drawn bad luck down upon me? Do you know enough to deny it completely, Syl?\u201D\r\nShe stood in the air, her arms folded, saying nothing.\r\n\u201CThis\u2026thing,\u201D Kaladin said, gesturing toward the stone. \u201CIt isn\u2019t natural. The Radiants betrayed mankind. Their powers left them, and they were cursed. Everyone knows the legends.\u201D He looked down at his hands, still glowing, though more faintly than before. \u201CWhatever we\u2019ve done, whatever has happened to me, I\u2019ve somehow brought upon myself their same curse. That\u2019s why everyone around me dies when I try to help them.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd you think I\u2019m a curse?\u201D she asked him.\r\n\u201CI\u2026Well, you said you\u2019re part of it, and\u2026\u201D\r\nShe strode forward, pointing at him, a tiny, irate woman hanging in the air. \u201CSo you think I\u2019ve caused all of this? Your failures? The deaths?\u201D\r\nKaladin didn\u2019t respond. He realized almost immediately that silence might be the worst response. Syl\u2014surprisingly human in her emotions\u2014spun in the air with a wounded look and zipped away, forming a ribbon of light.\r\nI\u2019m overreacting,he told himself. He was just so unsettled. He leaned back against the wall, hand to head. Before he had time to collect his thoughts, shadows darkened the entry to the alleyway. Teft and Lopen.\r\n\u201CRock talkers!\u201D Lopen said. \u201CYou really shine in shade, gancho!\u201D\r\nTeft gripped Lopen\u2019s shoulder. \u201CHe\u2019s not going to tell anyone, lad. I\u2019ll make certain of it.\u201D\r\n\u201CYeah, gancho,\u201D Lopen said. \u201CI swore I\u2019d say nothing. You can trust a Herdazian.\u201D\r\nKaladin looked at the two, overwhelmed. He pushed past them, running out of the alley and across the lumberyard, fleeing from watching eyes.\r\nBy the time night drew close, the light had long since stopped streaming from Kaladin\u2019s body. It had faded like a fire going out, and had only taken a few minutes to vanish.\r\nKaladin walked southward along the edge of the Shattered Plains, in that transitional area between the warcamps and the Plains themselves. In some areas\u2014like at the staging area near Sadeas\u2019s lumbercamp\u2014there was a soft slope leading down between the two. At other points, there was a short ridge, eight or so feet tall. He passed one of these now, rocks to his right, open Plains to his left.\r\nHollows, crevasses, and nooks scored the rock. Some shadowed sections here still hid pools of water from the highstorms days ago. Creatures still scuttled around the rocks, though the cooling evening air would soon drive them to hide. He passed a place pocked with small, water-filled holes; cremlings\u2014multilegged, bearing tiny claws, their elongated bodies plated with carapace\u2014lapped and fed at the edges. A small tentacle snapped out, yanking one down into the hole. Probably a grasper.\r\nGrass grew up the side of the ridge beside him, and the blades peeked from their holes. Bunches of fingermoss sprouted like flowers amid the green. The bright pink and purple fingermoss tendrils were reminiscent of tentacles themselves, waving at him in the wind. When he passed, the timid grass pulled back, but the fingermoss was bolder. The clumps would only pull into their shells if he tapped the rock near them.\r\nAbove him, on the ridge, a few scouts stood watch over the Shattered Plains. This area beneath the ridge belonged to no specific highprince, and the scouts ignored Kaladin. He would only be stopped if he tried to leave the warcamps at the southern or northern sides.\r\nNone of the bridgemen had come after him. He wasn\u2019t certain what Teft had told them. Perhaps he\u2019d said Kaladin was distraught following Maps\u2019s death.\r\nIt felt odd to be alone. Ever since he\u2019d been betrayed by Amaram and made a slave, he had been in the company of others. Slaves with whom he\u2019d plotted. Bridgemen with whom he\u2019d worked. Soldiers to guard him, slavemasters to beat him, friends to depend on him. The last time he\u2019d been alone had been that night when he\u2019d been tied up for the highstorm to kill him.\r\nNo,he thought.\r\nI wasn\u2019t alone that night. Syl was there.He lowered his head, passing small cracks in the ground to his left. Those lines eventually grew into chasms as they moved eastward.\r\nWhat was happening to him? He wasn\u2019t delusional. Teft and Lopen had seen it too. Teft had actually seemed to expect it.\r\nKaladin\r\nshouldhave died during that highstorm. And yet, he had been up and walking shortly afterward. His ribs should still be tender, but they hadn\u2019t ached in weeks. His spheres, and those of the other bridgemen near him, had consistently run out of Stormlight.\r\nHad it been the highstorm that had changed him? But no, he\u2019d discovered drained spheres before being hung out to die. And Syl\u2026she\u2019d as much as admitted responsibility for some of what had happened. This had been going on a long time.\r\nHe stopped beside a rock outcropping, resting against it, causing grass to shrink away. He looked eastward, over the Shattered Plains. His home. His sepulcher. This life on them was ripping him apart. The bridgemen looked up to him, thought him their leader, their savior. But he had cracks in him, like the cracks in the stone here at the edges of the Plains.\r\nThose cracks were growing larger. He kept making promises to himself, like a man running a long distance with no energy left. Just a little farther. Run just to that next hill. Then you can give up. Tiny fractures, fissures in the stone.\r\nIt\u2019s right that I came here,he thought.\r\nWe belong together, you and I. I\u2019m like you.What had made the Plains break in the first place? Some kind of great weight?\r\nA melody began playing distantly, carrying over the Plains. Kaladin jumped at the sound. It was so unexpected, so out of place, that it was startling despite its softness.\r\nThe sounds were coming from the Plains. Hesitant, yet unable to resist, he walked forward. Eastward, onto the flat, windswept rock. The sounds grew louder as he walked, but they were still haunting, elusive. A flute, though one lower in pitch than most he\u2019d heard.\r\nAs he grew closer, Kaladin smelled smoke. A light was burning out there. A tiny campfire.\r\nKaladin walked out to the edge of this particular peninsula, a chasm growing from the cracks until it plunged down into darkness. At the very tip of the peninsula\u2014surrounded on three sides by chasm\u2014Kaladin found a man sitting on a boulder, wearing a lighteyes\u2019s black uniform. A small fire of rockbud shell burned in front of him. The man\u2019s hair was short and black, his face angular. He wore a thin, black-sheathed sword at his waist.\r\nThe man\u2019s eyes were a pale blue. Kaladin had never heard of a lighteyed man playing a flute. Didn\u2019t they consider music a feminine pursuit? Lighteyed men sang, but they didn\u2019t play instruments unless they were ardents.\r\nThis man was extremely talented. The odd melody he played was alien, almost unreal, like something from another place and time. It echoed down the chasm and came back; it almost sounded like the man was playing a duet with himself.\r\nKaladin stopped a short distance away, realizing that the last thing he wanted to do now was deal with a brightlord, particularly one who was eccentric enough to dress in black and wander out onto the Shattered Plains to practice his flute. Kaladin turned to go.\r\nThe music cut off. Kaladin paused.\r\n\u201CI always worry that I\u2019ll forget how to play her,\u201D a soft voice said from behind. \u201CIt\u2019s silly, I know, considering how long I\u2019ve practiced. But these days I rarely give her the attention she deserves.\u201D\r\nKaladin turned toward the stranger. His flute was carved from a dark wood that was almost black. The instrument seemed too ordinary to belong to a lighteyes, yet the man held it reverently.\r\n\u201CWhat are you doing here?\u201D Kaladin asked.\r\n\u201CSitting. Occasionally playing.\u201D\r\n\u201CI mean, why are you here?\u201D\r\n\u201CWhy am I here?\u201D the man asked, lowering his flute, leaning back and relaxing. \u201CWhy are any of us here? That\u2019s a rather deep question for a first meeting, young bridgeman. I generally prefer introductions before theology. Lunch too, if it can be found. Perhaps a nice nap. Actually, practically anything should come before theology. But especially introductions.\u201D\r\n\u201CAll right,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CAnd you are\u2026?\u201D\r\n\u201CSitting. Occasionally playing\u2026 with the minds of bridgemen.\u201D\r\nKaladin reddened, turning again to go. Let the fool lighteyes say, and do, what he wished. Kaladin had difficult decisions to think about.\r\n\u201CWell, off with you then,\u201D the lighteyes said from behind. \u201CGlad you are going. Wouldn\u2019t want you too close. I\u2019m rather attached to my Stormlight.\u201D\r\nKaladin froze. Then he spun. \u201CWhat?\u201D\r\n\u201CMy spheres,\u201D the strange man said, holding up what appeared to be a fully infused emerald broam. \u201CEveryone knows that bridgemen are thieves, or at least beggars.\u201D\r\nOf course. He had been talking about spheres. He didn\u2019t know about Kaladin\u2019s\u2026 affliction. Did he? The man\u2019s eyes twinkled as if at a grand joke.\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t be insulted at being called a thief,\u201D the man said, raising a finger. Kaladin frowned. Where had the sphere gone? He had been holding it in that hand. \u201CI meant it as a compliment.\u201D\r\n\u201CA compliment? Calling someone a thief?\u201D\r\n\u201COf course. I myself am a thief.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou are? What do you steal?\u201D\r\n\u201CPride,\u201D the man said, leaning forward. \u201CAnd occasionally boredom, if I may take the pride unto myself. I am the King\u2019s Wit. Or I was until recently. I think I shall probably lose the title soon.\u201D\r\n\u201CThe king\u2019s what?\u201D\r\n\u201CWit. It was my job to be witty.\u201D\r\n\u201CSaying confusing things isn\u2019t the same as being witty.\u201D\r\n\u201CAh,\u201D the man said, eyes twinkling. \u201CAlready you prove yourself more wise than most who have been my acquaintance lately. What is it to be witty, then?\u201D\r\n\u201CTo say clever things.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd what is cleverness?\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2026\u201D Why was he having this conversation? \u201CI guess it\u2019s the ability to say and do the right things at the right time.\u201D\r\nThe King\u2019s Wit cocked his head, then smiled. Finally, he held out his hand to Kaladin. \u201CAnd what is your name, my thoughtful bridgeman?\u201D\r\nKaladin hesitantly raised his own hand. \u201CKaladin. And yours?\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve many.\u201D The man shook Kaladin\u2019s hand. \u201CI began life as a thought, a concept, words on a page. That was another thing I stole. Myself. Another time, I was named for a rock.\u201D\r\n\u201CA pretty one, I hope.\u201D\r\n\u201CA beautiful one,\u201D the man said. \u201CAnd one that became completely worthless for my wearing it.\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, what do men call you now?\u201D\r\n\u201CMany a thing, and only some of them polite. Almost all are true, unfortunately. You, however, you may call me Hoid.\u201D\r\n\u201CYour name?\u201D\r\n\u201CNo. The name of someone I should have loved. Once again, this is a thing I stole. It is something we thieves do.\u201D He glanced eastward, over the rapidly darkening Plains. The little fire burning beside Hoid\u2019s boulder shed a fugitive light, red from glimmering coals.\r\n\u201CWell, it was pleasant to meet you,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CI will be on my way\u2026.\u201D\r\n\u201CNot before I give you something.\u201D Hoid picked up his flute. \u201CWait, please.\u201D\r\nKaladin sighed. He had a feeling that this odd man was not going to let him escape until he was done.\r\n\u201CThis is a Trailman\u2019s flute,\u201D Hoid said, inspecting the length of dark wood. \u201CIt is meant to be used by a storyteller, for him to play while he is telling a story.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou mean to\r\naccompanya storyteller. Being played by someone else while he speaks.\u201D\r\n\u201CActually, I meant what I said.\u201D\r\n\u201CHow would a man tell a story while playing the flute?\u201D\r\nHoid raised an eyebrow, then lifted the flute to his lips. He played it differently from flutes Kaladin had seen\u2014instead of holding it down in front of him, Hoid held it out to the side and blew across its top. He tested a few notes. They had the same melancholy tone that Kaladin had heard before.\r\n\u201CThis story,\u201D Hoid said, \u201Cis about Derethil and the\r\nWandersail.\u201D\r\nHe began to play. The notes were quicker, sharper, than the ones he\u2019d played earlier. They almost seemed to tumble over one another, scurrying out of the flute like children racing one another to be first. They were beautiful and crisp, rising and falling scales, intricate as a woven rug.\r\nKaladin found himself transfixed. The tune was powerful, almost\r\ndemanding. As if each note were a hook, flung out to spear Kaladin\u2019s flesh and hold him near.\r\nHoid stopped abruptly, but the notes continued to echo in the chasm, coming back as he spoke. \u201CDerethil is well known in some lands, though I have heard him spoken of less here in the East. He was a king during the shadowdays, the time before memory. A powerful man. Commander of thousands, leader of tens of thousands. Tall, regal, blessed with fair skin and fairer eyes. He was a man to envy.\u201D\r\nJust as the echoes faded below, Hoid began to play again, picking up the rhythm. He actually seemed to continue just where the echoing notes grew too soft, as if there had never been a break in the music. The notes grew more smooth, suggesting a king walking through court with his attendants. As Hoid played, eyes closed, he leaned forward toward the fire. The air he blew over the flute churned the smoke, stirring it.\r\nThe music grew softer. The smoke swirled, and Kaladin thought he could make out the face of a man in the patterns of smoke, a man with a pointed chin and lofty cheekbones. It wasn\u2019t really there, of course. Just imagination. But the haunting song and the swirling smoke seemed to encourage his imagination.\r\n\u201CDerethil fought the Voidbringers during the days of the Heralds and Radiants,\u201D Hoid said, eyes still closed, flute just below his lips, the song echoing in the chasm and seeming to accompany his words. \u201CWhen there was finally peace, he found he was not content. His eyes always turned westward, toward the great open sea. He commissioned the finest ship men had ever known, a majestic vessel intended to do what none had dared before: sail the seas during a highstorm.\u201D\r\nThe echoes tapered off, and Hoid began playing again, as if alternating with an invisible partner. The smoke swirled, rising in the air, twisting in the wind of Hoid\u2019s breath. And Kaladin almost thought he could see an enormous ship in a shipyard, with a sail as large as a building, secured to an arrowlike hull. The melody became quick and clipped, as if to imitate the sounds of mallets pounding and saws cutting.\r\n\u201CDerethil\u2019s goal,\u201D Hoid paused and said, \u201Cwas to seek the origin of the Voidbringers, the place where they had been spawned. Many called him a fool, yet he could not hold himself back. He named the vessel the\r\nWandersailand gathered a crew of the bravest of sailors. Then, on a day when a highstorm brewed, this ship cast off. Riding out into the ocean, the sail hung wide, like arms open to the stormwinds\u2026.\u201D\r\nThe flute was at Hoid\u2019s lips in a second and he stirred the fire by kicking at a piece of rockbud shell. Sparks of flame rose in the air and smoke puffed, swirling as Hoid rotated his head down and pointed the flute\u2019s holes at the smoke. The song became violent, tempestuous, notes falling unexpectedly and trilling with quick undulations. Scales rippled into high notes, where they screeched airily.\r\nAnd Kaladin saw it in his mind\u2019s eye. The massive ship suddenly miniscule before the awesome power of a highstorm. Blown, carried out into the endless sea. What had this Derethil hoped or expected to find? A highstorm on land was terrible enough. But on the sea?\r\nThe sounds bounced off the echoing walls below. Kaladin found himself sinking down to the rocks, watching the swirling smoke and rising flames. Seeing the tiny ship captured and held within a furious maelstrom.\r\nEventually, Hoid\u2019s music slowed, and the violent echoes faded, leaving a much gentler song. Like lapping waves.\r\n\u201CThe\r\nWandersailwas nearly destroyed in the crash, but Derethil and most of his sailors survived. They found themselves on a ring of small islands surrounding an enormous whirlpool, where, it is said, the ocean drains. Derethil and his men were greeted by a strange people with long, limber bodies who wore robes of single color and shells in their hair unlike any that grow back on Roshar.\r\n\u201CThese people took the survivors in, fed them, and nursed them back to health. During his weeks of recovery, Derethil studied the strange people, who called themselves the Uvara, the People of the Great Abyss. They lived curious lives. Unlike the people in Roshar\u2014who constantly argue\u2014 the Uvara always seemed to agree. From childhood, there were no questions. Each and every person went about his duty.\u201D\r\nHoid began the music again, letting the smoke rise unhindered. Kaladin thought he could see in it a people, industrious, always working. A building rose among them with a figure at the window, Derethil, watching. The music was calming, curious.\r\n\u201COne day,\u201D Hoid said, \u201Cwhile Derethil and his men were sparring to regain strength, a young serving girl brought them refreshment. She tripped on an uneven stone, dropping the goblets to the floor and shattering them. In a flash, the other Uvara descended on the hapless child and slaughtered her in a brutal way. Derethil and his men were so stunned that by the time they regained their wits, the child was dead. Angry, Derethil demanded to know the cause of the unjustified murder. One of the other natives explained. \u2018Our emperor will not suffer failure.\u2019\u201D\r\nThe music began again, sorrowful, and Kaladin shivered. He witnessed the girl being bludgeoned to death with rocks, and the proud form of Derethil bowing above her fallen body.\r\nKaladin knew that sorrow. The sorrow of failure, of letting someone die when he should have been able to do something. So many people he loved had died.\r\nHe had a reason for that now. He\u2019d drawn the ire of the Heralds and the Almighty. It had to be that, didn\u2019t it?\r\nHe knew he should be getting back to Bridge Four. But he couldn\u2019t pull himself away. He hung on the storyteller\u2019s words.\r\n\u201CAs Derethil began to pay more attention,\u201D Hoid said, his music echoing softly to accompany him, \u201Che saw other murders. These Uvara, these People of the Great Abyss, were prone to astonishing cruelty. If one of their members did something wrong\u2014something the slightest bit untoward or unfavorable\u2014the others would slaughter him or her. Each time he asked, Derethil\u2019s caretaker gave him the same answer. \u2018Our emperor will not suffer failure.\u2019\u201D\r\nThe echoing music faded, but once again Hoid lifted his flute just as it grew too soft to hear. The melody grew solemn. Soft, quiet, like a lament for one who had passed. And yet it was edged with mystery, occasional quick bursts, hinting at secrets.\r\nKaladin frowned as he watched the smoke spin, making what appeared to be a tower. Tall, thin, with an open structure at the top.\r\n\u201CThe emperor, Derethil discovered, resided in the tower on the eastern coast of the largest island among the Uvara.\u201D\r\nKaladin felt a chill. The smoke images were just from his mind, adding to the story, weren\u2019t they? Had he really seen a tower\r\nbeforeHoid mentioned it?\r\n\u201CDerethil determined that he needed to confront this cruel emperor. What kind of monster would demand that such an obviously peaceful people kill so often and so terribly? Derethil gathered his sailors, a heroic group, and they armed themselves. The Uvara did not try to stop them, though they watched with fright as the strangers stormed the emperor\u2019s tower.\u201D\r\nHoid fell silent, and didn\u2019t turn back to his flute. Instead, he let the music echo in the chasm. It seemed to linger this time. Long, sinister notes.\r\n\u201CDerethil and his men came out of the tower a short time later, carrying a desiccated corpse in fine robes and jewelry. \u2018This is your emperor?\u2019 Derethil demanded. \u2018We found him in the top room, alone.\u2019 It appeared that the man had been dead for years, but nobody had dared enter his tower. They were too frightened of him.\r\n\u201CWhen he showed the Uvara the dead body, they began to wail and weep. The entire island was cast into chaos, as the Uvara began to burn homes, riot, or fall to their knees in torment. Amazed and confused, Derethil and his men stormed the Uvara shipyards, where the\r\nWandersailwas being repaired. Their guide and caretaker joined them, and she begged to accompany them in their escape. So it was that Nafti joined the crew.\r\n\u201CDerethil and his men set sail, and though the winds were still, they rode the\r\nWandersailaround the whirlpool, using the momentum to spin them out and away from the islands. Long after they left, they could see the smoke rising from the ostensibly peaceful lands. They gathered on the deck, watching, and Derethil asked Nafti the reason for the terrible riots.\u201D\r\nHoid fell silent, letting his words rise with the strange smoke, lost to the night.\r\n\u201CWell?\u201D Kaladin demanded. \u201CWhat was her response?\u201D\r\n\u201CHolding a blanket around herself, staring with haunted eyes at her lands, she replied, \u2018Do you not see, Traveling One? If the emperor is dead, and has been all these years, then the murders we committed are not his responsibility. They are our own.\u2019\u201D\r\nKaladin sat back. Gone was the taunting, playful tone Hoid had used earlier. No more mockery. No more quick tongue intended to confuse. This story had come from within his heart, and Kaladin found he could not speak. He just sat, thinking of that island and the terrible things that had been done.\r\n\u201CI think\u2026\u201D Kaladin finally replied, licking his dry lips, \u201CI think that is cleverness.\u201D\r\nHoid raised an eyebrow, looking up from his flute.\r\n\u201CBeing able to remember a story like that,\u201D Kaladin said, \u201Cto tell it with such care.\u201D\r\n\u201CBe wary of what you say,\u201D Hoid said, smiling. \u201CIf all you need for cleverness is a good story, then I\u2019ll find myself out of a job.\u201D\r\n\u201CDidn\u2019t you say you were already out of a job?\u201D\r\n\u201CTrue. The king is finally without wit. I wonder what that makes him.\u201D\r\n\u201CUm\u2026 witless?\u201D Kaladin said.\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll tell him you said that,\u201D Hoid noted, eyes twinkling. \u201CBut I think it\u2019s inaccurate. One can have a wit, but not a witless. What is a wit?\u201D\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know. Some kind of spren in your head, maybe, that makes you think?\u201D\r\nHoid cocked his head, then laughed. \u201CWhy, I suppose that\u2019s as good an explanation as any.\u201D He stood up, dusting off his black trousers.\r\n\u201CIs the story true?\u201D Kaladin asked, rising too.\r\n\u201CPerhaps.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut how would we know it? Did Derethil and his men return?\u201D\r\n\u201CSome stories say they did.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut how could they? The highstorms only blow one direction.\u201D\r\n\u201CThen I guess the story is a lie.\u201D\r\n\u201CI didn\u2019t say that.\u201D\r\n\u201CNo, I said it. Fortunately, it\u2019s the best kind of lie.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd what kind is that?\u201D\r\n\u201CWhy, the kind\r\nItell, of course.\u201D Hoid laughed, then kicked out the fire, grinding the last of the coals beneath his heel. It didn\u2019t really seem there had been enough fuel to make the smoke Kaladin had seen.\r\n\u201CWhat did you put in the fire?\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CTo make that special smoke?\u201D\r\n\u201CNothing. It was just an ordinary fire.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut, I saw\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat you saw belongs to you. A story doesn\u2019t live until it is imagined in someone\u2019s mind.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat does the story mean, then?\u201D\r\n\u201CIt means what you want it to mean,\u201D Hoid said. \u201CThe purpose of a storyteller is not to tell you how to think, but to give you questions to think upon. Too often, we forget that.\u201D\r\nKaladin frowned, looking westward, back toward the warcamps. They were alight now with spheres, lanterns, and candles. \u201CIt means taking responsibility,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CThe Uvara, they were happy to kill and murder, so long as they could blame the emperor. It wasn\u2019t until they realized there was nobody to take the responsibility that they showed grief.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s one interpretation,\u201D Hoid said. \u201CA fine one, actually. So what is it you don\u2019t want to take responsibility for?\u201D\r\nKaladin started. \u201CWhat?\u201D\r\n\u201CPeople see in stories what they\u2019re looking for, my young friend.\u201D He reached behind his boulder, pulling out a pack and slinging it on his shoulder. \u201CI have no answers for you. Most days, I feel I never have had any answers. I\u2019ve come to your land to chase an old acquaintance, but I end up spending most of my time hiding from him instead.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou said\u2026 about me and responsibility\u2026\u201D\r\n\u201CJust an idle comment, nothing more.\u201D He reached over, laying a hand on Kaladin\u2019s shoulder. \u201CMy comments are often idle. I never can get them to do any solid work. Would that I could make my words carry stones. That would be something to see.\u201D He held out the dark wood flute. \u201CHere. I\u2019ve carried her for longer than you\u2019d believe, were I to tell you the truth. Take her for yourself.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut I don\u2019t know how to play it!\u201D\r\n\u201CThen learn,\u201D Hoid said, pressing the flute into Kaladin\u2019s hand. \u201CWhen you can make the music sing back at you, then you\u2019ve mastered it.\u201D He began to walk away. \u201CAnd take good care of that blasted apprentice of mine. He really should have let me know he was still alive. Perhaps he feared I\u2019d come to rescue him again.\u201D\r\n\u201CApprentice?\u201D\r\n\u201CTell him I graduate him,\u201D Hoid said, still walking. \u201CHe\u2019s a full Worldsinger now. Don\u2019t let him get killed. I spent far too long trying to force some sense into that brain of his.\u201D\r\nSigzil,Kaladin thought. \u201CI\u2019ll give him the flute,\u201D he called after Hoid.\r\n\u201CNo you won\u2019t,\u201D Hoid said, turning, walking backward as he left. \u201CIt\u2019s a gift to\r\nyou, Kaladin Stormblessed. I expect you to be able to play it when next we meet!\u201D\r\nAnd with that, the storyteller turned and broke into a jog, heading off toward the warcamps. He didn\u2019t move to go up into them, however. His shadowed figure turned to the south, as if he were intending to leave the camps. Where was he going?\r\nKaladin looked down at the flute in his hand. It was heavier than he had expected. What kind of wood was it? He rubbed its smooth length, thinking.\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t like him,\u201D Syl\u2019s voice said suddenly, coming from behind. \u201CHe\u2019s strange.\u201D\r\nKaladin spun to find her on the boulder, sitting where Hoid had been a moment ago.\r\n\u201CSyl!\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CHow long have you been here?\u201D\r\nShe shrugged. \u201CYou were watching the story. I didn\u2019t want to interrupt.\u201D She sat with hands in her lap, looking uncomfortable.\r\n\u201CSyl\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m behind what is happening to you,\u201D she said, voice soft. \u201CI\u2019m doing it.\u201D\r\nKaladin frowned, stepping forward.\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s both of us,\u201D she said. \u201CBut without me, nothing would be changing in you. I\u2019m\u2026 taking something from you. And giving something in return. It\u2019s the way it used to work, though I can\u2019t remember how or when. I just know that it was.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CHush,\u201D she said. \u201CI\u2019m talking.\u201D\r\n\u201CSorry.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m willing to stop it, if you want,\u201D she said. \u201CBut I would go back to being as I was before. That scares me. Floating on the wind, never remembering anything for longer than a few minutes. It\u2019s because of this tie between us that I can think again, that I can remember what and who I am. If we end it, I lose that.\u201D\r\nShe looked up at Kaladin, sorrowful.\r\nHe looked into those eyes, then took a deep breath. \u201CCome,\u201D he said, turning, walking back down the peninsula.\r\nShe flew over, becoming a ribbon of light, floating idly in the air beside his head. Soon they reached the place beneath the ridge leading to the warcamps. Kaladin turned north, toward Sadeas\u2019s camp. The cremlings had retreated to their cracks and burrows, but many of the plants still continued to let their fronds float in the cool wind. When he passed, the grass pulled back in, looking like the fur of some black beast in the night, lit by Salas.\r\nWhat responsibility are you avoiding\u2026.\r\nHe wasn\u2019t avoiding responsibility. He took too much responsibility! Lirin had said it constantly, chastising Kaladin for feeling guilt over deaths he couldn\u2019t have prevented.\r\nThough there was one thing he clung to. An excuse, perhaps, like the dead emperor. It was the soul of the wretch. Apathy. The belief that nothing was his fault, the belief that he couldn\u2019t change anything. If a man was cursed, or if he believed he didn\u2019t have to care, then he didn\u2019t need to hurt when he failed. Those failures couldn\u2019t have been prevented. Someone or something else had ordained them.\r\n\u201CIf I\u2019m not cursed,\u201D Kaladin said softly, \u201Cthen why do I live when others die?\u201D\r\n\u201CBecause of us,\u201D Syl said. \u201CThis bond. It makes you stronger, Kaladin.\u201D\r\n\u201CThen why can\u2019t it make me strong enough to help the others?\u201D\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know,\u201D Syl said. \u201CMaybe it can.\u201D\r\nIf I get rid of it, I\u2019ll go back to being normal. For what purpose\u2026 so I can die with the others?\r\nHe continued to walk in the darkness, passing lights above that made vague, faint shadows on the stones in front of him. The tendrils of fingermoss, clumped in bunches. Their shadows seemed arms.\r\nHe thought often about saving the bridgemen. And yet, as he considered, he realized that he often framed saving them in terms of saving himself. He told himself he wouldn\u2019t\r\nletthem die, because he knew what it\u00A0would do to him if they did. When he lost men, the wretch threatened to take over because of how much Kaladin hated failing.\r\nWas that it? Was that why he searched for reasons why he might be cursed? To explain his failure away? Kaladin began to walk more quickly.\r\nHe was doing something good in helping the bridgemen\u2014but he also was doing something selfish. The powers had unsettled him because of the responsibility they represented.\r\nHe broke into a jog. Before long, he was sprinting.\r\nBut if it wasn\u2019t about\r\nhim\u2014if he wasn\u2019t helping the bridgemen because he loathed failure, or because he feared the pain of watching them die\u2014 then it would be about\r\nthem. About Rock\u2019s affable gibes, about Moash\u2019s intensity, about Teft\u2019s earnest gruff ness or Peet\u2019s quiet dependability. What would he do to protect them? Give up his illusions? His excuses?\r\nSeize whatever opportunity he could, no matter how it changed him? No matter how it unnerved him, or what burdens it represented?\r\nHe dashed up the incline to the lumberyard.\r\nBridge Four was making their evening stew, chatting and laughing. The nearly twenty wounded men from other crews sat eating gratefully. It was gratifying, how quickly they had lost their hollow-eyed expressions and begun laughing with the other men.\r\nThe smell of spicy Horneater stew was thick in the air. Kaladin slowed his jog, coming to a stop beside the bridgemen. Several looked concerned as they saw him, panting and sweating. Syl landed on his shoulder.\r\nKaladin sought out Teft. The aging bridgeman sat alone below the barrack\u2019s eaves, staring down at the rock in front of him. He hadn\u2019t noticed Kaladin yet. Kaladin gestured for the others to continue, then walked over to Teft. He squatted down before the man.\r\nTeft looked up in surprise. \u201CKaladin?\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat do you know?\u201D Kaladin said quietly, intense. \u201CAnd how do you know it?\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2014\u201D Teft said. \u201CWhen I was a youth, my family belonged to a secret sect that awaited the return of the Radiants. I quit when I was just a youth. I thought it was nonsense.\u201D\r\nHe was holding things back; Kaladin could tell from the hesitation in his voice.\r\nResponsibility.\u201CHow much do you know about what I can do?\u201D\r\n\u201CNot much,\u201D Teft said. \u201CJust legends and stories. Nobody really knows what the Radiants could do, lad.\u201D\r\nKaladin met his eyes, then smiled. \u201CWell, we\u2019re going to find out.\u201D"

      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\n\u201CReShephir, the Midnight Mother, giving birth to abominations with her essence so dark, so terrible, so consuming. She is here! She watches me die!\u201D\r\n\u2014Dated Shashabev, 1173, 8 seconds pre-death. Subject: a darkeyed dock-worker in his forties, father of three.\r\n\u201CI have a serious loathing of being wrong.\u201D Adolin reclined in his chair, one hand resting leisurely on the crystal-topped table, the other swirling wine in his cup. Yellow wine. He wasn\u2019t on duty today, so he could indulge just a tad.\r\nWind ruffled his hair; he was sitting with a group of other young lighteyes at the outdoor tables of an Outer Market wineshop. The Outer Market was a collection of buildings that had grown up near the king\u2019s palace, outside the warcamps. An eclectic mix of people passed on the street below their terraced seating.\r\n\u201CI should think that everyone shares your dislike, Adolin,\u201D Jakamav said, leaning with both elbows on the table. He was a sturdy man, a lighteyes of the third dahn from Highprince Roion\u2019s camp. \u201CWho\r\nlikesbeing wrong?\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve known a number of people who prefer it,\u201D Adolin said thoughtfully. \u201COf course, they don\u2019t\r\nadmitthat fact. But what else could one presume from the frequency of their error?\u201D\r\nInkima\u2014Jakamav\u2019s accompaniment for the afternoon\u2014gave a tinkling laugh. She was a plump thing with light yellow eyes who dyed her hair black. She wore a red dress. The color did not look good on her.\r\nDanlan was also there, of course. She sat on a chair beside Adolin, keeping proper distance, though she\u2019d occasionally touch his arm with her freehand. Her wine was violet. She\r\ndidlike her wine, though she seemed to match it to her outfits. A curious trait. Adolin smiled. She looked extremely fetching, with that long neck and graceful build wrapped in a sleek dress. She didn\u2019t dye her hair, though it was mostly auburn. There was nothing wrong with light hair. In fact, why was it that they all were so fond of\r\ndarkhair, when light eyes were the ideal?\r\nStop it,Adolin told himself.\r\nYou\u2019ll end up brooding as much as Father.\r\nThe other two\u2014Toral and his companion Eshava\u2014were both lighteyes from Highprince Aladar\u2019s camp. House Kholin was currently out of favor, but Adolin had acquaintances or friends in nearly all of the warcamps.\r\n\u201CWrongness can be amusing,\u201D Toral said. \u201CIt keeps life interesting. If we were all right all the time, where would that leave us?\u201D\r\n\u201CMy dear,\u201D his companion said. \u201CDidn\u2019t you once claim to me that you were nearly always right?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D Toral said. \u201CAnd so if everyone were like me, who would I make sport of? I\u2019d dread being made so mundane by everyone else\u2019s competence.\u201D\r\nAdolin smiled, taking a drink of his wine. He had a formal duel in the arena today, and he\u2019d found that a cup of yellow beforehand helped him relax. \u201CWell, you needn\u2019t worry about\r\nmebeing right too often, Toral. I was sure Sadeas would move against my father. It doesn\u2019t make sense. Why wouldn\u2019t he?\u201D\r\n\u201CPositioning, perhaps?\u201D Toral said. He was a keen fellow, known for his refined sense of taste. Adolin always wanted him along when trying wines. \u201CHe wants to look strong.\u201D\r\n\u201CHe\r\nwasstrong,\u201D Adolin said. \u201CHe gains no more by not moving against us.\u201D\r\n\u201CNow,\u201D Danlan said, voice soft with a breathless quality to it, \u201CI know that I\u2019m quite new to the warcamps, and my assessment is bound to reflect my ignorance, but\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CYou always say that, you know,\u201D Adolin said idly. He liked her voice quite a bit.\r\n\u201CI always say what?\u201D\r\n\u201CThat you\u2019re ignorant,\u201D Adolin said. \u201CHowever, you\u2019re anything but. You\u2019re among the most clever women I\u2019ve met.\u201D\r\nShe hesitated, looking oddly annoyed for a moment. Then she smiled. \u201CYou shouldn\u2019t say such things\u2014Adolin\u2014when a woman is attempting humility.\u201D\r\n\u201COh, right. Humility. I\u2019ve forgotten that existed.\u201D\r\n\u201CToo much time around Sadeas\u2019s lighteyes?\u201D Jakamav said, eliciting another tinkling laugh from Inkima.\r\n\u201CAnyway,\u201D Adolin said. \u201CI\u2019m sorry. Please continue.\u201D\r\n\u201CI was saying,\u201D Danlan said, \u201Cthat I doubt Sadeas would wish to start a war. Moving against your father in such an obvious way would have done that, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201D\r\n\u201CUndoubtedly,\u201D Adolin said.\r\n\u201CSo perhaps that is why he held himself back.\u201D\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know,\u201D Toral said. \u201CHe could have cast shame on your family without attacking you\u2014he could have implied, for instance, that you\u2019d been negligent and foolish in not protecting the king, but that you hadn\u2019t been behind the assassination attempt.\u201D\r\nAdolin nodded.\r\n\u201CThat still could have started a war,\u201D Danlan said.\r\n\u201CPerhaps,\u201D Toral said. \u201CBut you have to admit, Adolin, that the Blackthorn\u2019s reputation is a little less than\u2026 impressive of late.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd what does that mean?\u201D Adolin snapped.\r\n\u201COh, Adolin,\u201D Toral said waving a hand and raising his cup for some more wine. \u201CDon\u2019t be tiresome. You know what I\u2019m saying, and you\r\nalsoknow I mean no insult by it. Where\r\nisthat serving woman?\u201D\r\n\u201COne would think,\u201D Jakamav added, \u201Cthat after six years out here, we could get a decent winehouse.\u201D\r\nInkima laughed at that too. She was\r\nreallygetting annoying.\r\n\u201CMy father\u2019s reputation is sound,\u201D Adolin said. \u201COr have you not been paying attention to our victories lately?\u201D\r\n\u201CAchieved with Sadeas\u2019s help,\u201D Jakamav said.\r\n\u201CAchieved nonetheless,\u201D Adolin said. \u201CIn the last few months, my father\u2019s saved not only Sadeas\u2019s life, but that of the king himself. He fights boldly. Surely you can see that previous rumors about him were absolutely unfounded.\u201D\r\n\u201CAll right, all right,\u201D Toral said. \u201CNo need to get upset, Adolin. We can all agree that your father is a wonderful man. But you\r\nwerethe one who complained to us that you wanted to change him.\u201D\r\nAdolin studied his wine. Both of the other men at the table wore the sort of outfits Adolin\u2019s father frowned upon. Short jackets over colorful silk shirts. Toral wore a thin yellow silk scarf at the neck and another around his right wrist. It was quite fashionable, and looked far more comfortable than Adolin\u2019s uniform. Dalinar would have said that the outfits looked silly, but sometimes fashion\r\nwassilly. Bold, different. There was something invigorating about dressing in a way that interested others, moving with the waves of style. Once, before joining his father at the war, Adolin had loved being able to design a look to match a given day. Now he had only two options: summer uniform coat or winter uniform coat.\r\nThe serving maid finally arrived, bringing two carafes of wine, one yellow and one deep blue. Inkima giggled as Jakamav leaned over and whispered something in her ear.\r\nAdolin held up a hand to forestall the maid from filling his cup. \u201CI\u2019m not sure I want to see my father change. Not anymore.\u201D\r\nToral frowned. \u201CLast week\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CI know,\u201D Adolin said. \u201CThat was before I saw him rescue Sadeas. Every time I start to forget how amazing my father is, he does something to prove me one of the ten fools. It happened when Elhokar was in danger too. It\u2019s like\u2026 my father only acts like that when he\r\nreallycares about something.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou imply that he doesn\u2019t really care about the war, Adolin dear,\u201D Danlan said.\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D Adolin said. \u201CJust that the lives of Elhokar and Sadeas might be more important than killing Parshendi.\u201D\r\nThe others took that for an explanation, moving on toward other topics. But Adolin found himself circling the thought. He felt unsettled lately. Being wrong about Sadeas was one cause; the chance that they might actually be able to prove the visions right or wrong was another.\r\nAdolin felt trapped. He\u2019d pushed his father to confront his own sanity, and now\u2014by what their last conversation had established\u2014he had all but agreed to accept his father\u2019s decision to step down if the visions proved false.\r\nEveryone hates being wrong,Adolin thought.\r\nExcept my father said he\u2019drather\r\nbe wrong, if it would be better for Alethkar.Adolin doubted many lighteyes would rather be proven mad than right.\r\n\u201CPerhaps,\u201D Eshava was saying. \u201CBut that doesn\u2019t change all of his foolish restrictions. I wish he\r\nwouldstep down.\u201D\r\nAdolin started. \u201CWhat? What was that?\u201D\r\nEshava glanced at him. \u201CNothing. Just seeing if you were attending the conversation, Adolin.\u201D\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D Adolin said. \u201CTell me what you were saying.\u201D\r\nShe shrugged, looking at Toral.\r\nToral leaned forward. \u201CYou don\u2019t think the warcamps are\r\nignoringwhat happens to your father during highstorms, Adolin. Word is that he should abdicate because of it.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat would be foolish,\u201D Adolin said firmly. \u201CConsidering how much success he\u2019s showing in battle.\u201D\r\n\u201CStepping down would be far too much of an overreaction,\u201D Danlan agreed. \u201CThough, Adolin, I\r\ndowish you could get your father to relax all of these foolish restrictions our camp is under. You and the other Kholin men would be able to\r\ntrulyjoin society again.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve tried,\u201D he said, checking the position of the sun. \u201CTrust me. And, unfortunately, I have a duel to prepare for. If you\u2019ll excuse me.\u201D\r\n\u201CSome more of Sadeas\u2019s sycophants?\u201D Jakamav asked.\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D Danlan said, smiling. \u201CIt\u2019s Brightlord Resi. There\u2019ve been some vocal provocations from Thanadal, and this might serve to shut his mouth.\u201D She looked at Adolin fondly. \u201CI\u2019ll meet you there.\u201D\r\n\u201CThanks,\u201D he said, rising, doing up the buttons on his coat. He kissed Danlan\u2019s freehand, waved to the others, and trotted out onto the street.\r\nThat was something of an abrupt departure for me,he thought.\r\nWill they see how uncomfortable the discussion made me?Probably not. They didn\u2019t know him as Renarin did. Adolin liked to be familiar with a large number of people, but not terribly close with any of them. He didn\u2019t even know Danlan that well yet. He\r\nwouldmake his relationship with her last, though. He was tired of Renarin teasing him for jumping in and out of courtships. Danlan was very pretty; it seemed the courtship could work.\r\nHe passed through the Outer Market, Toral\u2019s words weighing on him. Adolin didn\u2019t want to become highprince. He wasn\u2019t ready. He liked dueling and chatting with his friends. Leading the army was one thing\u2014but as highprince, he\u2019d have to think of other things. Such as the future of the war on the Shattered Plains, or protecting and advising the king.\r\nThat shouldn\u2019t have to be our problem,he thought. But it was as his father always said. If they didn\u2019t do it, who would?\r\nThe Outer Market was far more disorganized than the markets inside Dalinar\u2019s warcamp. Here, the ramshackle buildings\u2014mostly built of stone blocks quarried from nearby\u2014had grown up without any specific plan. A large number of the merchants were Thaylen, with their typical caps, vests, and long, wagging eyebrows.\r\nThe busy market was one of the few places where soldiers from all ten warcamps mingled. In fact, that had become one of the main functions of the place; it was neutral ground where men and women from different warcamps could meet. It also provided a market that wasn\u2019t heavily regulated, though Dalinar had stepped in to provide some rules once the marketplace had begun to show signs of lawlessness.\r\nAdolin nodded to a passing group of Kholin soldiers in blue, who saluted him. They were on patrol, halberds held at their shoulders, helms gleaming. Dalinar\u2019s troops patrolled this place, and his scribes watched over it. All at his own cost.\r\nHis father didn\u2019t like the layout of the Outer Market or its lack of walls. He said that a raid could be catastrophic to it, that it violated the spirit of the Codes. But it had been years since the Parshendi had raided the Alethi side of the Plains. And if they did decide to strike at the warcamps, the scouts and guards would give ample warning.\r\nSo what was the point of the Codes? Adolin\u2019s father acted as if they were vitally important. Always be in uniform, always be armed, always stay sober. Be ever vigilant while under threat of attack. But there\r\nwasno threat of attack.\r\nAs he walked through the market, Adolin looked\u2014really looked\u2014for the first time and tried to see what it was his father was doing.\r\nHe could pick out Dalinar\u2019s officers easily. They wore their uniforms, as commanded. Blue coats and trousers with silver buttons, knots on the shoulders for rank. Officers who weren\u2019t from Dalinar\u2019s camp wore all kinds of clothing. It was difficult to pick them out from the merchants and other wealthy civilians.\r\nBut that doesn\u2019t matter,Adolin told himself again.\r\nBecause we\u2019re not going to be attacked.\r\nHe frowned, passing a group of lighteyes lounging outside another winehouse. Much as he\u2019d just been doing. Their clothing\u2014indeed, their postures and mannerisms\u2014made them look like they cared only about their revelry. Adolin found himself annoyed. There was a war going on. Almost every day, soldiers died. They did so while lighteyes drank and chatted.\r\nMaybe the Codes weren\u2019t just about protecting against the Parshendi. Maybe they were about something more\u2014about giving the men commanders they could respect and rely on. About treating war with the gravity it deserved. Maybe it was about not turning a war zone into a festival. The common men had to remain on watch, vigilant. Therefore, Adolin and Dalinar did the same.\r\nAdolin hesitated in the street. Nobody cursed at him or called for him to move\u2014they could see his rank. They just went around him.\r\nI think I see now,he thought. Why had it taken him so long?\r\nDisturbed, he hurried on his way toward the day\u2019s match.\r\n\u201C\u2018I walked from Abamabar to Urithiru,\u2019\u201D Dalinar said, quoting from memory. \u201C\u2018In this, the metaphor and experience are one, inseparable to me like my mind and memory. One contains the other, and though I can explain one to you, the other is only for me.\u2019\u201D\r\nSadeas\u2014sitting beside him\u2014raised an eyebrow. Elhokar sat on Dalinar\u2019s other side, wearing his Shardplate. He\u2019d taken to that more and more, sure that assassins were thirsting for his life. Together, they watched the men dueling down below, at the bottom of a small crater that Elhokar had designated the warcamps\u2019 dueling arena. The rocky shelves running around the inside of the ten-foot-tall wall made excellent seating platforms.\r\nAdolin\u2019s duel hadn\u2019t started yet, and the men who fought right now were lighteyes, but not Shardbearers. Their dull-edged dueling swords were crusted with a white, chalklike substance. When one achieved a hit on the other\u2019s padded armor, it would leave a visible mark.\r\n\u201CSo, wait,\u201D Sadeas said to him. \u201CThis man who wrote the book\u2026\u201D\r\n\u201CNohadon is his holy name. Others call him Bajerden, though we\u2019re not certain whether that was actually his real name or not.\u201D\r\n\u201CHe decided to walk from where to where?\u201D\r\n\u201CAbamabar to Urithiru,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CI think it must have been a great distance, from the way the story is told.\u201D\r\n\u201CWasn\u2019t he a king?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut why\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s confusing,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CBut listen. You\u2019ll see.\u201D He cleared his throat and continued. \u201C\u2018I strode this insightful distance on my own, and forbade attendants. I had no steed beyond my well-worn sandals, no companion beside a stout staff to offer conversation with its beats against the stone. My mouth was to be my purse; I stuffed it not with gems, but with song. When singing for sustenance failed me, my arms worked well for cleaning a floor or hogpen, and often earned me a satisfactory reward.\r\n\u201C\u2018Those dear to me took fright for my safety and, perhaps, my sanity. Kings, they explained, do not walk like beggars for hundreds of miles. My response was that if a beggar could manage the feat, then why not a king? Did they think me less capable than a beggar?\r\n\u201C\u2018Sometimes I think that I am. The beggar knows much that the king can only guess. And yet who draws up the codes for begging ordinances? Often I wonder what my experience in life\u2014my easy life following the Desolation, and my current level of comfort\u2014has given me of any true experience to use in making laws. If we had to rely on what we knew, kings would only be of use in creating laws regarding the proper heating of tea and cushioning of thrones.\u2019\u201D\r\nSadeas frowned at this. In front of them, the two swordsmen continued their duel; Elhokar watched keenly. He loved duels. Bringing in sand to coat the floor of this arena had been one of his first acts at the Shattered Plains.\r\n\u201C\u2018Regardless,\u2019\u201D Dalinar said, still quoting from\r\nThe Way of Kings, \u201C\u2018I made the trip and\u2014as the astute reader has already concluded\u2014survived it. The stories of its excitements will stain a different page in this narrative, for first I must explain my purpose in walking this strange path. Though I was quite willing to let my family think me insane, I would not leave the same as my cognomen upon the winds of history.\r\n\u201C\u2018My family traveled to Urithiru via the direct method, and had been awaiting me for weeks when I arrived. I was not recognized at the gate, for my mane had grown quite robust without a razor to tame it. Once I revealed myself, I was carried away, primped, fed, worried over, and scolded in precisely that order. Only after all of this was through was I finally asked the purpose of my excursion. Couldn\u2019t I have just taken the simple, easy, and common route to the holy city?\u2019\u201D\r\n\u201CExactly,\u201D Sadeas interjected. \u201CHe could at the very least have ridden a horse!\u201D\r\n\u201C\u2018For my answer,\u2019\u201D Dalinar quoted, \u201C\u2018I removed my sandals and proffered my callused feet. They were comfortable upon the table beside my half-consumed tray of grapes. At this point, the expressions of my companions proclaimed that they thought me daft, and so I explained by relating the stories of my trip. One after another, like stacked sacks of tallew, stored for the winter season. I would make flatbread of them soon, then stuff it between these pages.\r\n\u201C\u2018Yes, I could have traveled quickly. But all men have the same ultimate destination. Whether we find our end in a hallowed sepulcher or a pauper\u2019s ditch, all save the Heralds themselves must dine with the Nightwatcher.\r\n\u201C\u2018And so, does the destination matter? Or is it the path we take? I declare that no accomplishment has substance nearly as great as the road used to achieve it. We are not creatures of destinations. It is the journey that shapes us. Our callused feet, our backs strong from carrying the weight of our travels, our eyes open with the fresh delight of experiences lived.\r\n\u201C\u2018In the end, I must proclaim that no good can be achieved of false means. For the substance of our existence is not in the achievement, but in the method. The Monarch must understand this; he must not become so focused on what he wishes to accomplish that he diverts his gaze from the path he must take to arrive there.\u2019\u201D\r\nDalinar sat back. The rock beneath them had been cushioned and augmented with wooden armrests and back supports. The duel ended with one of the lighteyes\u2014wearing green, as he was subject to Sadeas\u2014scoring a hit on the breastplate of the other, leaving a long white mark. Elhokar clapped his approval, gauntleted hands clanking, and both duelists bowed. The winner\u2019s victory would be recorded by the women sitting in the judging seats. They also held the books of dueling code, and would adjudicate disputes or infractions.\r\n\u201CThat is the end of your story, I presume,\u201D Sadeas said, as the next two duelists walked out onto the sand.\r\n\u201CIt is,\u201D Dalinar said.\r\n\u201CAnd you have that entire passage memorized?\u201D\r\n\u201CI likely got a few of the words wrong.\u201D\r\n\u201CKnowing you, that means you might have forgotten a single \u2018an\u2019 or \u2018the.\u2019\u201D\r\nDalinar frowned.\r\n\u201COh, don\u2019t be so stiff, old friend,\u201D Sadeas said. \u201CThat was a compliment. Of sorts.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat did you think of the story?\u201D Dalinar asked as the dueling resumed.\r\n\u201CIt was ridiculous,\u201D Sadeas said frankly, waving for a servant to bring him some wine. Yellow, as it was yet morning. \u201CHe walked all that distance just to make the point that kings should consider the consequences of their commands?\u201D\r\n\u201CIt wasn\u2019t just to prove the point,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CI thought that myself, but I\u2019ve begun to see. He walked because he wanted to experience the things his people did. He used it as a metaphor, but I think he really wanted to know what it was like to walk that far.\u201D\r\nSadeas took a sip of his wine, then squinted up at the sun. \u201CCouldn\u2019t we get an awning or something set up out here?\u201D\r\n\u201CI like the sun,\u201D Elhokar said. \u201CI spend too much time locked away in those caves we call buildings.\u201D\r\nSadeas glanced at Dalinar, rolling his eyes.\r\n\u201CMuch of\r\nThe Way of Kingsis organized like that passage I quoted you,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CA metaphor from Nohadon\u2019s life\u2014a real event turned into an example. He calls them the forty parables.\u201D\r\n\u201CAre they all so ridiculous?\u201D\r\n\u201CI think this one is beautiful,\u201D Dalinar said softly.\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t doubt that you do. You always have loved sentimental stories.\u201D He raised a hand. \u201CThat was also intended to be a compliment.\u201D\r\n\u201COf sorts?\u201D\r\n\u201CExactly. Dalinar, my friend, you always have been emotional. It makes you genuine. It can also get in the way of levelheaded thinking\u2014but so long as it continues to prompt you to save my life, I think I can live with it.\u201D He scratched his chin. \u201CI suppose, by definition, I would have to, wouldn\u2019t I?\u201D\r\n\u201CI guess.\u201D\r\n\u201CThe other highprinces think you are self-righteous. Surely you can see why.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2026\u201D What could he say? \u201CI don\u2019t mean to be.\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, you do provoke them. Take, for example, the way you refuse to rise to their arguments or insults.\u201D\r\n\u201CProtesting simply draws attention to the issue,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CThe finest defense of character is correct action. Acquaint yourself with virtue, and you can expect proper treatment from those around you.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou see, there,\u201D Sadeas said. \u201CWho talks like that?\u201D\r\n\u201CDalinar does,\u201D Elhokar said, though he was still watching the dueling. \u201CMy father used to.\u201D\r\n\u201CPrecisely,\u201D Sadeas said. \u201CDalinar, friend, the others simply cannot accept that the things you say are serious. They assume it must be an act.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd you? What do you think of me?\u201D\r\n\u201CI can see the truth.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhich is?\u201D\r\n\u201CThat you are a self-righteous prude,\u201D Sadeas said lightly. \u201CBut you come by it honestly.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m certain you mean that to be a compliment too.\u201D\r\n\u201CActually, this time I\u2019m just trying to annoy you.\u201D Sadeas raised his cup of wine to Dalinar.\r\nTo the side, Elhokar grinned. \u201CSadeas. That was quite nearly clever. Shall I have to name you the new Wit?\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat happened to the old one?\u201D Sadeas\u2019s voice was curious, even eager, as if hoping to hear that tragedy had befallen Wit.\r\nElhokar\u2019s grin became a scowl. \u201CHe vanished.\u201D\r\n\u201CIs that so? How disappointing.\u201D\r\n\u201CBah.\u201D Elhokar waved a gauntleted hand. \u201CHe does this on occasion. He\u2019ll return eventually. Unreliable as Damnation itself, that one. If he didn\u2019t make me laugh so, I\u2019d have replaced him seasons ago.\u201D\r\nThey fell silent, and the dueling continued. A few other lighteyes\u2014both women and men\u2014watched, seated on the benchlike ridges. Dalinar noted with discomfort that Navani had arrived, and was chatting with a group of women, including Adolin\u2019s latest infatuation, the auburn-haired scribe.\r\nDalinar\u2019s eyes lingered on Navani, drinking in her violet dress, her mature beauty. She\u2019d recorded his most recent visions without complaint, and seemed to have forgiven him for throwing her out of his rooms so sharply. She never mocked him, never acted skeptical. He appreciated that. Should he thank her, or would she see that as an invitation?\r\nHe averted his gaze from her, but found that he couldn\u2019t watch the dueling swordsmen without catching sight of her in the corner of his eye. So, instead, he glanced up into the sky, squinting against the afternoon sun. The sounds of metal hitting metal came from below. Behind him, several large snails clung to the rock, waiting for highstorm water.\r\nHe had so many questions, so many uncertainties. He listened to\r\nThe Way of Kingsand worked to discover what Gavilar\u2019s last words had meant. As if, somehow, they held the key to both his madness and the nature of the visions. But the truth was that he didn\u2019t know anything, and he couldn\u2019t rely on his own decisions. That was unhinging him, bit by bit, point by point.\r\nClouds seemed less frequent here, in these windswept plains. Just the blazing sun broken by the furious highstorms. The rest of Roshar was influenced by the storms\u2014but here in the East, the feral, untamed highstorms ruled supreme. Could any mortal king hope to claim these lands? There were legends of them being inhabited, of there being more than just unclaimed hills, desolate plains, and overgrown forests. Natanatan, the Granite Kingdom.\r\n\u201CAh,\u201D Sadeas said, sounding as if he\u2019d tasted something bitter. \u201CDid he have to come?\u201D\r\nDalinar lowered his head and followed Sadeas\u2019s gaze. Highprince Vamah had arrived to watch the dueling, retinue in tow. Though most of them wore his traditional brown and grey colorings, the highprince himself wore a long grey coat that had slashes cut across it to reveal the bright red and orange silk underneath, matched by the ruffles peeking out of the cuffs and collar.\r\n\u201CI thought you had a fondness for Vamah,\u201D Elhokar said.\r\n\u201CI tolerate him,\u201D Sadeas replied. \u201CBut his fashion sense is absolutely repulsive. Red and orange? Not even a burnt orange, but a blatant, eye-breaking orange. And the rent style hasn\u2019t been fashionable for ages. Ah, wonderful, he\u2019s sitting directly across from us. I shall be forced to stare at him for the rest of the session.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou shouldn\u2019t judge people so harshly based on how they look,\u201D Dalinar said.\r\n\u201CDalinar,\u201D Sadeas said flatly, \u201Cwe are highprinces. We\r\nrepresentAlethkar. Many around the world view us as a center of culture and influence. Should I not, therefore, have the right to encourage a proper presentation to the world?\u201D\r\n\u201CA proper presentation, yes,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CIt is right for us to be fit and neat.\u201D\r\nIt would be nice if your soldiers, for instance, kept their uniforms clean.\r\n\u201CFit, neat, and fashionable,\u201D Sadeas corrected.\r\n\u201CAnd me?\u201D Dalinar asked, looking down at his simple uniform. \u201CWould you have me dress in those ruffles and bright colors?\u201D\r\n\u201CYou?\u201D Sadeas asked. \u201CYou\u2019re completely hopeless.\u201D He raised a hand to forestall objection. \u201CNo, I am unfair. That uniform has a certain\u2026 timeless quality to it. The military suit, by virtue of its utility, will never be completely out of fashion. It\u2019s a safe choice\u2014steady. In a way, you avoid the issue of fashion by not playing the game.\u201D He nodded to Vamah. \u201CVamah tries to play, but does so very poorly. And that is unforgivable.\u201D\r\n\u201CI still say you place too much importance on those silks and scarves,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CWe are soldiers at war, not courtiers at a ball.\u201D\r\n\u201CThe Shattered Plains are quickly becoming a destination for foreign dignitaries. It is important to present ourselves properly.\u201D He raised a finger to Dalinar. \u201CIf I am to accept your moral superiority, my friend, then perhaps it is time for you to accept my sense of fashion. One might note that\r\nyoujudge people by their clothing even more than I do.\u201D\r\nDalinar fell silent. That comment stung in its truthfulness. Still, if dignitaries were going to meet with the highprinces on the Shattered Plains, was it too much to ask for them to find an efficient group of warcamps led by men who at least looked like generals?\r\nDalinar settled back to watch the match end. By his count, it was time for Adolin\u2019s bout. The two lighteyes who had been fighting bowed to the king, then withdrew into a tent on the side of the dueling grounds. A moment later, Adolin stepped out onto the sand, wearing his deep blue Shardplate. He carried his helm under his arm, his blond-and-black hair a stylish mess. He raised a gauntleted hand to Dalinar and bowed his head to the king, then put on his helm.\r\nThe man who walked out behind him wore Shardplate painted yellow. Brightlord Resi was the only full Shardbearer in Highprince Thanadal\u2019s army\u2014though their warcamp had three men who carried only the Blade or the Plate. Thanadal himself had neither. It wasn\u2019t uncommon for a highprince to rely on his finest warriors as Shardbearers; it made sound sense, particularly if you were the sort of general who preferred to stay behind the lines and direct tactics. In Thanadal\u2019s own princedom, the tradition for centuries had been to appoint the holder of Resi\u2019s Shards as something known as the Royal Defender.\r\nThanadal had recently been vocal about Dalinar\u2019s faults, and so Adolin\u2014 in a moderately subtle move\u2014had challenged the highprince\u2019s star Shardbearer to a friendly bout. Few duels were for Shards; in this case, losing wouldn\u2019t cost either man anything other than statistics in the rankings. The match drew an unusual amount of attention, and the small arena filled over the next quarter hour while the duelists stretched and prepared. More than one woman set up a board to sketch or write impressions of the bout. Thanadal himself didn\u2019t attend.\r\nThe bout began as the highjudge in attendance, Lady Istow, called for the combatants to summon their Blades. Elhokar leaned forward again, intent, as Resi and Adolin circled one another on the sand, Shardblades materializing. Dalinar found himself leaning forward as well, though he did feel a stab of shame. According to the Codes, most duels should be avoided when Alethkar was at war. There was a fine line between sparring for practice and dueling another man for an insult, potentially leaving important officers wounded.\r\nResi stood in Stonestance, his Shardblade held before him in two hands, point toward the sky, arms all the way extended. Adolin used Windstance, turned sideways slightly, hands before him and elbows bent, Shardblade pointing back over his head. They circled. The winner would be the first one who completely shattered a section of the other\u2019s Plate. That wasn\u2019t too dangerous; weakened Plate could usually still rebuff a blow, even if it shattered in the process.\r\nResi attacked first, taking a hopping leap forward and striking by whipping his Shardblade back over his head, then down to his right in a powerful blow. Stonestance focused on that type of attack, delivering the most possible momentum and strength behind each strike. Dalinar found it unwieldy\u2014you didn\u2019t need that much power behind a Shardblade on the battlefield, though it was helpful against other Shardbearers.\r\nAdolin jumped back out of the way, Shardplate-enhanced legs giving him a nimbleness that defied the fact that he was wearing over a hundred stoneweights of thick armor. Resi\u2019s attack\u2014though well-executed\u2014left him open, and Adolin made a careful strike at his opponent\u2019s left vambrace, cracking the forearm plate. Resi attacked again, and Adolin again danced out of the way, then scored a hit on his opponent\u2019s left thigh.\r\nSome poets described combat as a dance. Dalinar rarely felt that way about regular combat. Two men fighting with sword and shield would go at one another in a furious rush, slamming their weapons down again and again, tying to get around their opponent\u2019s shield. Less a dance, and more like wrestling with weapons.\r\nFighting with Shardblades, though,\r\nthatcould be like a dance. The large weapons took a great deal of skill to swing properly, and Plate was resilient, so exchanges were generally drawn out. The fights were filled with grand motions, wide sweeps. There was a fluidity to fighting with a Shardblade. A grace.\r\n\u201CHe\u2019s quite good, you know,\u201D Elhokar said. Adolin made a hit on Resi\u2019s helm, prompting a round of applause from those watching. \u201CBetter than my father was. Better than even you, Uncle.\u201D\r\n\u201CHe works very hard,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CHe truly loves it. Not the war, not the fighting. The dueling.\u201D\r\n\u201CHe could be champion, if he wished it.\u201D\r\nAdolin did wish it, Dalinar knew. But he had refused bouts that would put him within reach of the title. Dalinar suspected that Adolin did it to hold, somewhat, to the Codes. Dueling championships and tournaments were things for those rare times between wars. It could be argued that protecting one\u2019s family honor, however, was for all times.\r\nEither way, Adolin didn\u2019t duel for ranking, and that made other Shardbearers underestimate him. They were quick to accept duels with him, and some non-Shardbearers challenged him. By tradition, the king\u2019s own Shardplate and Blade were available for a large fee to those who both had his favor and the wish to duel a Shardbearer.\r\nDalinar shivered at the thought of someone else wearing his Plate or holding Oathbringer. It was unnatural. And yet, the lending of the king\u2019s Blade and Plate\u2014or before the kingship had been restored, the lending of a highprince\u2019s Blade and Plate\u2014was a strong tradition. Even Gavilar had not broken it, though he had complained about it in private.\r\nAdolin dodged another blow, but he had begun to move into Windstance\u2019s offensive forms. Resi wasn\u2019t ready for this\u2014though he managed to hit Adolin once on the right pauldron, the blow was a glancing one. Adolin advanced, Blade sweeping in a fluid pattern. Resi backed away, falling into a parrying posture\u2014Stonestance was one of the few to rely on those.\r\nAdolin batted his opponent\u2019s Blade away, knocking it out of stance. Resi reset, but Adolin knocked it away again. Resi grew sloppier and sloppier getting back into stance and Adolin began to strike, hitting him on one side, then on the other. Small, quick blows, meant to unnerve.\r\nThey worked. Resi bellowed and threw himself into one of Stonestance\u2019s characteristic overhand blows. Adolin handled it perfectly, dropping his Blade to one hand, raising his left arm and taking the blow on his unharmed vambrace. It cracked badly, but the move allowed Adolin to bring his own Blade to the side and strike Resi\u2019s cracked left cuisse.\r\nThe thigh plate shattered with the sound of ripping metal, pieces blasting away, trailing smoke, glowing like molten steel. Resi stumbled back; his left leg could no longer bear the weight of the Shardplate. The match was over. More important duels might go for two or three broken plates, but that grew dangerous.\r\nThe highjudge stood, calling an end. Resi stumbled away, ripping off his helm. His curses were audible. Adolin saluted his enemy, tapping the blunt edge of his Blade to his forehead, then dismissing the Blade. He bowed to the king. Other men sometimes went into the crowd to brag or accept accolades, but Adolin retreated to the preparation tent.\r\n\u201CTalented indeed,\u201D Elhokar said.\r\n\u201CAnd such a\u2026 proper lad,\u201D Sadeas said, sipping his drink.\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CAt times, I wish there were peace, simply so that Adolin could dedicate himself to his dueling.\u201D\r\nSadeas sighed. \u201CMore talk of abandoning the war, Dalinar?\u201D\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s not what I meant.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou keep complaining that you\u2019ve given up that argument, Uncle,\u201D Elhokar said, turning to regard him. \u201CYet you continue to dance around it, speaking longingly of peace. People in the camps call you coward.\u201D\r\nSadeas snorted. \u201CHe\u2019s no coward, Your Majesty. I can attest to that.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhy, then?\u201D Elhokar asked.\r\n\u201CThese rumors have grown far beyond what is reasonable,\u201D Dalinar said.\r\n\u201CAnd yet, you do not answer my questions,\u201D Elhokar said. \u201CIf you could make the decision, Uncle, would you have us leave the Shattered Plains? Are you a coward?\u201D\r\nDalinar hesitated.\r\nUnite them,that voice had told him.\r\nIt is your task, and I give it to you.\r\nAm I a coward?he wondered. Nohadon challenged him, in the book, to examine himself. To never become so certain or high that he wasn\u2019t willing to seek truth.\r\nElhokar\u2019s question hadn\u2019t been about his visions. And yet, Dalinar had the distinct impression that he\r\nwasbeing a coward, at least in relation to his desire to abdicate. If he left because of what was happening to him, that would be taking the easy path.\r\nI can\u2019t leave,he realized.\r\nNo matter what happens. I have to see this through.Even if he was mad. Or, an increasingly worrisome thought, even if the visions were real, but their origins suspect.\r\nI have to stay. But I also have to plan, to make sure I don\u2019t tow my house down.\r\nSuch a careful line to walk. Nothing clear, everything clouded. He\u2019d been ready to run because he liked to make clear decisions. Well, nothing was clear about what was happening to him. It seemed that in making the decision to remain highprince, he placed one important cornerstone into rebuilding the foundation of who he was.\r\nHe would not abdicate. And that was that.\r\n\u201CDalinar?\u201D Elhokar asked. \u201CAre you\u2026 well?\u201D\r\nDalinar blinked, realizing that he had stopped paying attention to the king and Sadeas. Staring off into space like that wouldn\u2019t help his reputation. He turned to the king. \u201CYou want to know the truth,\u201D he said. \u201CYes, if I could make the order, I would bring all ten warcamps and return to Alethkar.\u201D\r\nDespite what others said, that was not cowardly. No, he\u2019d just confronted cowardice inside of him, and he knew what it was. This was something different.\r\nThe king looked shocked.\r\n\u201CI\r\nwouldleave,\u201D Dalinar said firmly. \u201CBut not because I wish to flee or because I fear battle. It would be because I fear for Alethkar\u2019s stability; leaving this war would help secure our homeland and the loyalty of the highprinces. I would send more envoys and scholars to find out why the Parshendi killed Gavilar. We gave up on that too easily. I still wonder if the assassination was initiated by miscreants or rebels among their own people.\r\n\u201CI\u2019d discover what their culture is\u2014and yes, they do have one. If rebels weren\u2019t the cause of the assassination, I\u2019d keep asking until I learned\r\nwhythey did it. I\u2019d demand repayment\u2014perhaps their own king, delivered to us for execution in turn\u2014in exchange for granting them peace. As for the gemhearts, I\u2019d speak with my scientists and discover a better method of holding this territory. Perhaps with mass homesteading of the area, securing all of the Unclaimed Hills, we could truly expand our borders and claim the Shattered Plains. I wouldn\u2019t\r\nabandonvengeance, Your Majesty, but I would approach it\u2014and our war here\u2014more thoughtfully. Right now, we know too little to be effective.\u201D\r\nElhokar looked surprised. He nodded. \u201CI\u2026 Uncle, that actually makes sense. Why didn\u2019t you explain it before?\u201D\r\nDalinar blinked. Just several weeks ago, Elhokar had been indignant when Dalinar had merely mentioned the idea of turning back. What had changed?\r\nI don\u2019t give the boy enough credit,he realized. \u201CI have had trouble explaining my own thoughts recently, Your Majesty.\u201D\r\n\u201CYour Majesty!\u201D Sadeas said. \u201CSurely you wouldn\u2019t actually consider\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CThis latest attempt on my life has me unsettled, Sadeas. Tell me. Have you made any progress in determining who put the weakened gems in my Plate?\u201D\r\n\u201CNot yet, Your Majesty.\u201D\r\n\u201CThey\u2019re trying to kill me,\u201D Elhokar said softly, huddling down in his armor. \u201CThey\u2019ll see me dead, like my father. Sometimes I do wonder if we\u2019re chasing after the ten fools here. The assassin in white\u2014he was Shin.\u201D\r\n\u201CThe Parshendi took responsibility for sending him,\u201D Sadeas said.\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D Elhokar replied. \u201CAnd yet they are savages, and easily manipulated. It would be a perfect distraction, pinning the blame on a group of parshmen. We go to war for years and years, never noticing the real villains, working quietly in my own camp. They watch me. Always. Waiting. I see their faces in mirrors. Symbols, twisted, inhuman\u2026\u201D\r\nDalinar glanced at Sadeas, and the two shared a disturbed look. Was Elhokar\u2019s paranoia growing worse, or had it always been hidden? He saw phantom cabals in every shadow, and now\u2014with the attempt on his life\u2014 he had proof to feed those worries.\r\n\u201CRetreating from the Shattered Plains could be a good idea,\u201D Dalinar said carefully. \u201CBut not if it is to begin another war with someone else. We must stabilize and unify our people.\u201D\r\nElhokar sighed. \u201CChasing the assassin is only an idle thought right now. Perhaps we won\u2019t need it. I hear that your efforts with Sadeas have been fruitful.\u201D\r\n\u201CThey have indeed, Your Majesty,\u201D Sadeas said, sounding proud\u2014perhaps a little smug. \u201CThough Dalinar still insists on using his own, slow bridges. Sometimes, my forces are nearly wiped out before he arrives. This would work better if Dalinar would use modern bridge tactics.\u201D\r\n\u201CThe waste of life\u2026\u201D Dalinar said.\r\n\u201CIs acceptable,\u201D Sadeas said. \u201CThey\u2019re mostly slaves, Dalinar. It\u2019s an honor for them to have a chance to participate in some small way.\u201D\r\nI doubt they see it in that light.\r\n\u201CI wish you\u2019d at least\r\ntrymy way,\u201D Sadeas continued. \u201CWhat we\u2019ve been doing so far has worked, but I worry that the Parshendi will continue to send two armies against us. I don\u2019t relish the idea of fighting both on my own before you arrive.\u201D\r\nDalinar hesitated. That would be a problem. But to give up the siege bridges?\r\n\u201CWell, why not a compromise?\u201D Elhokar said. \u201CNext plateau assault, Uncle, you let Sadeas\u2019s bridgemen help you for the initial march to the contested plateau. Sadeas has plenty of extra bridge crews he could lend you. He could still rush on ahead with a smaller army, but you\u2019d follow more quickly than you have been, using his bridge crews.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat would be the same as using my own bridge crews,\u201D Dalinar said.\r\n\u201CNot necessarily,\u201D Elhokar said. \u201CYou\u2019ve said that the Parshendi can rarely set up and fire on you once Sadeas engages them. Sadeas\u2019s men can start the assault as usual, and you can join once he\u2019s secured a foothold for you.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes\u2026\u201D Sadeas said, thoughtful. \u201CThe bridgemen\r\nyouuse will be safe, and you won\u2019t be costing any additional lives. But you\u2019ll arrive at the plateau to help me twice as quickly.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat if you can\u2019t distract the Parshendi well enough?\u201D Dalinar asked. \u201CWhat if they still set up archers to fire on my bridgemen when I cross?\u201D\r\n\u201CThen we\u2019ll retreat,\u201D Sadeas said with a sigh. \u201CAnd we\u2019ll call it a failed experiment. But at least we\u2019ll have tried. This is how you get ahead, old friend. You try new things.\u201D\r\nDalinar scratched his chin in thought.\r\n\u201COh, go on, Dalinar,\u201D Elhokar said. \u201CHe took your suggestion to attack together. Try it once his way.\u201D\r\n\u201CVery well,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CWe will see how it works.\u201D\r\n\u201CExcellent,\u201D Elhokar said, standing. \u201CAnd now, I believe I\u2019ll go congratulate your son. That bout was exciting!\u201D\r\nDalinar hadn\u2019t found it particularly exciting\u2014Adolin\u2019s opponent hadn\u2019t ever held the upper hand. But that was the best kind of battle. Dalinar didn\u2019t buy the arguments about a \u2018good\u2019 fight being a close one. When you won, it was always better to win quickly and with extreme advantage.\r\nDalinar and Sadeas stood in respect as the king descended the stairlike stone outcroppings toward the sandy floor below. Dalinar then turned to Sadeas. \u201CI should be leaving. Send me a clerk to detail the plateaus you feel we could try this maneuver on. Next time one of them is up for assault, I\u2019ll march my army to your staging area and we\u2019ll leave together. You and the smaller, quicker group can go on ahead, and we\u2019ll catch up once you\u2019re in position.\u201D\r\nSadeas nodded.\r\nDalinar turned to climb up the steps toward the ramp out.\r\n\u201CDalinar,\u201D Sadeas called after him.\r\nDalinar looked back at the other highprince. Sadeas\u2019s scarf fluttered in a gust of wind, his arms folded, the metallic golden embroidery glistening. \u201CSend me one of your clerks as well. With a copy of that book of Gavilar\u2019s. It may amuse me to hear its other stories.\u201D\r\nDalinar smiled. \u201CI will do so, Sadeas.\u201D"

      "ChapterName": "59: AN HONOR",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\n\u201CAbove the final void I hang, friends behind, friends before. The feast I must drink clings to their faces, and the words I must speak spark in my mind. The old oaths will be spoken anew.\u201D\r\n\u2014Dated Betabanan, 1173, 45 seconds pre-death. Subject: a lighteyed child of five years. Diction improved remarkably when giving sample.\r\nKaladin glared at the three glowing topaz spheres on the ground in front of him. The barrack was dark, empty save for Teft and himself. Lopen leaned in the sunlit doorway, watching with a casual air. Outside, Rock called out commands to the other bridgemen. Kaladin had them working on battle formations. Nothing overt. It would be construed as practice for bridge carrying, but he was actually training them to obey orders and rearrange themselves efficiently.\r\nThe three little spheres\u2014only chips\u2014lit the stone ground around themselves in little tan rings. Kaladin focused on them, holding his breath, willing the light into him.\r\nNothing happened.\r\nHe tried harder, staring into their depths.\r\nNothing happened.\r\nHe picked one up, cupping it in his palm, raising it so that he could see the light and nothing else. He could pick out the details of the storm, the shifting, spinning vortex of light. He commanded it, willed it, begged it.\r\nNothing happened.\r\nHe groaned, lying back on the rock, staring at the ceiling.\r\n\u201CMaybe you don\u2019t want it badly enough,\u201D Teft said.\r\n\u201CI want it as badly as I know how. It won\u2019t budge, Teft.\u201D\r\nTeft grunted and picked up one of the spheres.\r\n\u201CMaybe we\u2019re wrong about me,\u201D Kaladin said. It seemed poetically appropriate that the moment he accepted this strange, frightening part of himself, he couldn\u2019t make it work. \u201CIt could have been a trick of the sunlight.\u201D\r\n\u201CA trick of the sunlight,\u201D Teft said flatly. \u201CSticking a bag to the barrel was a trick of the light.\u201D\r\n\u201CAll right. Then maybe it was some odd fluke, something that happened just that once.\u201D\r\n\u201C\r\nAndwhen you were wounded,\u201D Teft said, \u201C\r\nandwhenever on a bridge run you needed an extra burst of strength or endurance.\u201D\r\nKaladin let out a frustrated sigh and tapped his head back lightly against the rock floor a few times. \u201CWell, if I\u2019m one of these Radiants you keep talking about, why can\u2019t I do anything?\u201D\r\n\u201CI figure,\u201D the grizzled bridgeman said, rolling the sphere in his fingers, \u201Cthat you\u2019re like a baby, making his legs work. At first it just kind of happens. Slowly, he figures how to make them move on purpose. You just need practice.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve spent a week staring at spheres, Teft. How much practice can it take?\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, more than you\u2019ve had, obviously.\u201D\r\nKaladin rolled his eyes and sat back up. \u201CWhy am I listening to you? You\u2019ve admitted that you don\u2019t know any more than I do.\u201D\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know anything about using the Stormlight,\u201D Teft said, scowling. \u201CBut I know what\r\nshouldhappen.\u201D\r\n\u201CAccording to stories that contradict one another. You\u2019ve told me that the Radiants could fly and walk on walls.\u201D\r\nTeft nodded. \u201CThey sure could. And make stone melt by looking at it. And move great distances in a single heartbeat. And command the sunlight. And\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd why,\u201D Kaladin said, \u201Cwould they need to both walk on walls\r\nandfly? If they can fly, why would they bother running up walls?\u201D\r\nTeft said nothing.\r\n\u201CAnd why bother with either one,\u201D Kaladin added, \u201Cif they can just \u2018move great distances in a heartbeat\u2019?\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m not sure,\u201D Teft admitted.\r\n\u201CWe can\u2019t trust the stories or legends,\u201D Kaladin said. He glanced at Syl, who had landed beside one of the spheres, staring at it with childlike interest. \u201CWho knows what is true and what has been fabricated? The only thing we know for certain is this.\u201D He plucked up one of the spheres and held it up in two fingers. \u201CThe Radiant sitting in this room is very, very tired of the color brown.\u201D\r\nTeft grunted. \u201CYou\u2019re not a Radiant, lad.\u201D\r\n\u201CWeren\u2019t we just talking about\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201COh, you can infuse,\u201D Teft said. \u201CYou can drink in the Stormlight and command it. But being a Radiant was more than that. It was their way of life, the things they did. The Immortal Words.\u201D\r\n\u201CThe what?\u201D\r\nTeft rolled his sphere between his fingers again, holding it up and staring into its depths. \u201CLife before death. Strength before weakness. Journey before destination. That was their motto, and was the First Ideal of the Immortal Words. There were four others.\u201D\r\nKaladin raised an eyebrow. \u201CWhich were?\u201D\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t actually know,\u201D Teft said. \u201CBut the Immortal Words\u2014these Ideals\u2014guided everything they did. The four later Ideals were said to be different for every order of Radiants. But the First Ideal was the same for each of the ten: Life before death, strength before weakness, journey before destination.\u201D He hesitated. \u201COr so I was told.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes, well, that seems a little obvious to me,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CLife comes before death. Just like day comes before night, or one comes before two. Obvious.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou\u2019re not taking this seriously. Maybe that\u2019s why the Stormlight refuses you.\u201D\r\nKaladin stood and stretched. \u201CI\u2019m sorry, Teft. I\u2019m just tired.\u201D\r\n\u201CLife before death,\u201D Teft said, wagging a finger at Kaladin. \u201CThe Radiant seeks to defend life, always. He never kills unnecessarily, and never risks his own life for frivolous reasons. Living is harder than dying. The Radiant\u2019s duty is to live.\r\n\u201CStrength before weakness. All men are weak at some time in their lives. The Radiant protects those who are weak, and uses his strength for others. Strength does not make one capable of rule; it makes one capable of service.\u201D\r\nTeft picked up spheres, putting them in his pouch. He held the last one for a second, then tucked it away too. \u201CJourney before destination. There are always several ways to achieve a goal. Failure is preferable to winning through unjust means. Protecting ten innocents is not worth killing one. In the end, all men die. How you lived will be far more important to the Almighty than what you accomplished.\u201D\r\n\u201CThe Almighty? So the knights were tied to religion?\u201D\r\n\u201CIsn\u2019t everything? There was some old king who came up with all this. Had his wife write it in a book or something. My mother read it. The Radiants based the Ideals on what was written there.\u201D\r\nKaladin shrugged, moving over to begin sorting through the pile of bridgemen\u2019s leather vests. Ostensibly, he and Teft were here checking those over for tears or broken straps. After a few moments, Teft joined him.\r\n\u201CDo you actually believe that?\u201D Kaladin asked, lifting up a vest, tugging on its straps. \u201CThat anyone would follow those vows, particularly a bunch of lighteyes?\u201D\r\n\u201CThey weren\u2019t just lighteyes. They were Radiants.\u201D\r\n\u201CThey were people,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CMen in power always pretend things like virtue, or divine guidance, some kind of mandate to \u2018protect\u2019 the rest of us. If we believe that the Almighty put them where they are, it\u2019s easier for us to swallow what they do to us.\u201D\r\nTeft turned a vest over. It was beginning to tear beneath the left shoulder pad. \u201CI never used to believe. And then\u2026 then I saw you infusing Light, and I began to wonder.\u201D\r\n\u201CStories and legends, Teft,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CWe want to believe that there were better men once. That makes us think it could be that way again. But people don\u2019t change. They are corrupt now. They were corrupt then.\u201D\r\n\u201CMaybe,\u201D Teft said. \u201CMy parents believed in all of it. The Immortal Words, the Ideals, the Knights Radiant, the Almighty. Even old Vorinism. In fact, especially old Vorinism.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat led to the Hierocracy. The devotaries and the ardents shouldn\u2019t hold land or property. It\u2019s too dangerous.\u201D\r\nTeft snorted. \u201CWhy? You think they\u2019d be worse at being in charge than the lighteyes?\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, you\u2019ve probably got a point there.\u201D Kaladin frowned. He\u2019d spent so long assuming the Almighty had abandoned him, or even cursed him, that it was difficult to accept that maybe\u2014as Syl had said\u2014he\u2019d instead been blessed. Yes, he\u2019d been preserved, and he supposed he should be grateful for that. But what could be worse than being granted great power, yet still being too weak to save those he loved?\r\nFurther speculation was interrupted as Lopen stood up straight in the doorway, gesturing covertly to Kaladin and Teft. Fortunately, there wasn\u2019t anything to hide anymore. In fact, there hadn\u2019t ever been anything to hide, other than Kaladin sitting on the floor and staring at the spheres like an idiot. He set aside the vest and walked to the entrance.\r\nHashal\u2019s palanquin was being carried directly toward Kaladin\u2019s barrack, her tall, oft-silent husband walking alongside. The sash at his neck was violet, as was the embroidery on the cuffs of his short, vestlike jacket. Gaz still hadn\u2019t reappeared. It had been a week now, and no sign of him. Hashal and her husband\u2014along with their lighteyed attendants\u2014did what he\u2019d once done, and they rebuffed any questions about the bridge sergeant.\r\n\u201CStorm it,\u201D Teft said, stepping up beside Kaladin. \u201CThose two make my skin itch, same way it does when I know someone\u2019s got a knife and is standing behind me.\u201D\r\nRock had the bridgemen lined up and waiting quietly, as if for inspection. Kaladin walked out to join them, Teft and Lopen following behind. The bearers set the palanquin down in front of Kaladin. Open-sided with only a small canopy on the top, it was little more than an armchair on a platform. Many of the lighteyed women used them in the warcamps.\r\nKaladin reluctantly gave Hashal a proper bow, prompting the other bridgemen to do so as well. Now was not the time to be beaten for insubordination.\r\n\u201CYou have such a well-trained band, bridgeleader,\u201D she said, idly scratching her cheek with a ruby-red nail, her elbow on her armrest. \u201CSo\u2026 efficient at bridge runs.\u201D\r\n\u201CThank you, Brightness Hashal,\u201D Kaladin said, trying\u2014but failing\u2014to keep the stiff ness and hostility from his voice. \u201CMay I ask? Gaz hasn\u2019t been seen for some days now. Is he well?\u201D\r\n\u201CNo.\u201D Kaladin waited for further reply, but she didn\u2019t give one. \u201CMy husband has made a decision. Your men are so good at bridge runs that you are a model to the other crews. As such, you will be on bridge duty every day from now on.\u201D\r\nKaladin felt a chill. \u201CAnd scavenging duty?\u201D\r\n\u201COh, there will still be time for that. You need to take torches down anyway, and plateau runs never happen at night. So your men will sleep during the day\u2014always on call\u2014and will work the chasms at night. A much better use of your time.\u201D\r\n\u201CEvery bridge run,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CYou\u2019re going to make us go on\r\nevery one.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D she said idly, tapping for her bearers to raise her. \u201CYour team is just too good. It must be used. You\u2019ll start full-time bridge duty tomorrow. Consider it an\u2026 honor.\u201D\r\nKaladin inhaled sharply to keep himself from saying what he thought of her \u201Chonor.\u201D He couldn\u2019t bring himself to bow as she retreated, but she didn\u2019t seem to care. Rock and the men started muttering.\r\nEvery bridge run. She\u2019d just doubled the rate at which they\u2019d be killed. Kaladin\u2019s team wouldn\u2019t last another few weeks. They were already so low on members that losing one or two men on an assault would cause them to flounder. The Parshendi would focus on them then, cutting them down.\r\n\u201CKelek\u2019s breath!\u201D Teft said. \u201CShe\u2019ll see us dead!\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s not fair,\u201D Lopen added.\r\n\u201CWe\u2019re bridgemen,\u201D Kaladin said, looking at them. \u201CWhat made you think that any kind of \u2018fairness\u2019 applied to us?\u201D\r\n\u201CShe hasn\u2019t killed us fast enough for Sadeas,\u201D Moash said. \u201CYou know that soldiers have been beaten for coming to look for you, to see the man who survived the highstorm? He hasn\u2019t forgotten about you, Kaladin.\u201D\r\nTeft was still swearing. He pulled Kaladin aside, Lopen following, but the others remained talking among themselves. \u201CDamnation!\u201D Teft said softly. \u201CThey like to pretend to be evenhanded with the bridge crews. Makes \u2019em seem fair. Looks like they gave up on that. Bastards.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat do we do, gancho?\u201D Lopen asked.\r\n\u201CWe go to the chasms,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CJust like we\u2019re scheduled to. Then make sure we get some extra sleep tonight, as we\u2019re apparently going to be staying up all night tomorrow.\u201D\r\n\u201CThe men will hate going into the chasms at night, lad,\u201D Teft said.\r\n\u201CI know.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut we\u2019re not ready for\u2026 what we need to do,\u201D Teft said, looking to make sure nobody could hear. It was only him, Kaladin, and Lopen. \u201CIt will be another few weeks at least.\u201D\r\n\u201CI know.\u201D\r\n\u201CWe won\u2019t last another few weeks!\u201D Teft said. \u201CWith Sadeas and Kholin working together, runs happen nearly every day. Just one bad run\u2014one time with the Parshendi drawing bead on us\u2014and it will all be over. We\u2019ll be wiped out.\u201D\r\n\u201CI know!\u201D Kaladin said, frustrated, taking a deep breath and forming fists to keep himself from exploding.\r\n\u201CGancho!\u201D Lopen said.\r\n\u201CWhat?\u201D Kaladin snapped.\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s happening again.\u201D\r\nKaladin froze, then looked down at his arms. Sure enough, he caught a hint of luminescent smoke rising from his skin. It was extremely faint\u2014he didn\u2019t have many gemstones near him\u2014but it was there. The wisps faded quickly. Hopefully the other bridgemen hadn\u2019t seen.\r\n\u201CDamnation. What did I do?\u201D\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know,\u201D Teft said. \u201CIs it because you were angry at Hashal?\u201D\r\n\u201CI was angry before.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou breathed it in,\u201D Syl said eagerly, whipping around him in the air, a ribbon of light.\r\n\u201CWhat?\u201D\r\n\u201CI saw it.\u201D She twisted herself around. \u201CYou were mad, you drew in a breath, and the Light\u2026 it came too.\u201D\r\nKaladin glanced at Teft, but of course the older bridgeman hadn\u2019t heard. \u201CGather the men,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CWe\u2019re going down to our chasm duty.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd what about what has happened?\u201D Teft said. \u201CKaladin, we can\u2019t go on that many bridge runs. We\u2019ll be cut to pieces.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m doing something about it today. Gather the men. Syl, I need something from you.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat?\u201D She landed in front of him and formed into a young woman.\r\n\u201CGo find us a place where some Parshendi corpses have fallen.\u201D\r\n\u201CI thought you were going to do spear practice today.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s what the men will be doing,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CI\u2019ll get them organized first. After that, I have a different task.\u201D\r\nKaladin clapped a quick signal, and the bridgemen made a decent arrowhead formation. They carried the spears they\u2019d stashed in the chasm, secured in a large sack filled with stones and stuck in a crevice. He clapped his hands again, and they rearranged into a double-line wall formation. He clapped again, and they formed into a ring with one man standing behind every two as a quick step-in reserve.\r\nThe walls of the chasm dripped with water, and the bridgemen splashed through puddles. They were good. Better than they had any right to be, better\u2014for their level of training\u2014than any team he\u2019d worked with.\r\nBut Teft was right. They still wouldn\u2019t last long in a fight. A few more weeks and he\u2019d have them practiced enough with thrusts and shielding one another that they\u2019d begin to be dangerous. Until then, they were just bridgemen who could move in fancy patterns. They needed more time.\r\nKaladin had to buy them some.\r\n\u201CTeft,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CTake over.\u201D\r\nThe older bridgeman gave one of those cross-armed salutes.\r\n\u201CSyl,\u201D Kaladin said to the spren, \u201Clet\u2019s go see these bodies.\u201D\r\n\u201CThey\u2019re close. Come on.\u201D She zipped off down the chasm, a glowing ribbon. Kaladin started after her.\r\n\u201CSir,\u201D Teft called.\r\nKaladin hesitated. When had Teft started calling him \u201Csir\u201D? Odd, how right that felt. \u201CYes?\u201D\r\n\u201CYou want an escort?\u201D Teft stood at the head of the gathered bridgemen, who were looking more and more like soldiers, with their leather vests and spears held in practiced grips.\r\nKaladin shook his head. \u201CI\u2019ll be fine.\u201D\r\n\u201CChasmfiends\u2026\u201D\r\n\u201CThe lighteyes have killed any who prowl this close to our side. Besides, if I did run into one, what difference would two or three extra men make?\u201D\r\nTeft grimaced behind his short, greying beard, but offered no further objection. Kaladin continued to follow Syl. In his pouch, he carried the rest of the spheres they\u2019d discovered on bodies while scavenging. They made a habit of keeping some of each discovery and sticking them to bridges, and with Syl helping at scavenging, they now found more than they used to. He had a small fortune in his pouch. That Stormlight\u2014he hoped\u2014 would serve him well today.\r\nHe got out a sapphire mark for light, avoiding pools of water strewn with bones. A skull protruded from one, wavy green moss growing across the scalp like hair, lifespren bobbing above. Perhaps it should have felt eerie to walk through these darkened slots alone, but they didn\u2019t bother Kaladin. This was a sacred place, the sarcophagus of the lowly, the burial cavern of bridgemen and spearmen who died upon lighteyed edicts, spilling blood down the sides of these ragged walls. This place wasn\u2019t eerie; it was holy.\r\nHe was actually glad to be alone with his silence and the remains of those who had died. These men hadn\u2019t cared about the squabbles of those born with lighter eyes than they. These men had cared about their families or\u2014at the very least\u2014their sphere pouches. How many of them were trapped in this foreign land, these endless plateaus, too poor to escape back to Alethkar? Hundreds died each week, winning gems for men who were already rich, winning vengeance for a king long dead.\r\nKaladin passed another skull, missing its lower jaw, the crown split by an axe\u2019s blow. The bones seemed to watch him, curious, the blue Stormlight in his hand giving a haunted cast to the uneven ground and walls.\r\nThe devotaries taught that when men died, the most valiant among them\u2014the ones who fulfilled their Callings best\u2014would rise to help reclaim heaven. Each man would do as he had done in life. Spearmen to fight, farmers to work spiritual farms, lighteyes to lead. The ardents were careful to point out that excellence in any Calling would bring power. A farmer would be able to wave his hand and create great fields of spiritual crops. A spearman would be a great warrior, able to cause thunder with his shield and lightning with his spear.\r\nBut what of the bridgemen? Would the Almighty demand that all of these fallen rise and continue their drudgery? Would Dunny and the others run bridges in the afterlife? No ardents came to them to test their abilities or grant them Elevations. Perhaps the bridgemen wouldn\u2019t be needed in the War for Heaven. Only the very most skilled went there anyway. Others would simply slumber until the Tranquiline Halls were reclaimed.\r\nSo do I believe again now?He climbed over a boulder wedged in the chasm.\r\nJust like that?He wasn\u2019t sure. But it didn\u2019t matter. He would do the best he could for his bridgemen. If there was a Calling in that, so be it.\r\nOf course, if he did escape with his team, Sadeas would replace them with others who would die in their stead.\r\nI have to worry about what I can do,he told himself.\r\nThose other bridgemen aren\u2019t my responsibility.\r\nTeft talked about the Radiants, about ideals and stories. Why couldn\u2019t men actually be like that? Why did they have to rely on dreams and fabrications for inspiration?\r\nIf you flee\u2026 you leave all the other bridgemen to be slaughtered,a voice whispered within him.\r\nThere has to be something you can do for them.\r\nNo!he fought back.\r\nIf I worry about that, I won\u2019t be able to save Bridge Four. If I find a way out, we\u2019re going.\r\nIf you leave,the voice seemed to say,\r\nthen who will fight for them? Nobody cares. Nobody\u2026.\r\nWhat was it his father had said all those years ago? He did what he felt was right because someone had to start. Someone had to take the first step.\r\nKaladin\u2019s hand felt warm. He stopped in the chasm, closing his eyes. You couldn\u2019t feel any heat from a sphere, usually, but the one in his hand seemed warm. And then\u2014feeling completely natural about it\u2014Kaladin breathed in deeply. The sphere grew cold and a wave of heat shot up his arm.\r\nHe opened his eyes. The sphere in his hand was dun and his fingers were crispy with frost. Light rose from him like smoke from a fire, white, pure.\r\nHe raised a hand and felt alive with energy. He had no need to breathe\u2014 in fact, he held the breath in, trapping the Stormlight. Syl zipped back down the corridor toward him. She twisted around him, then came to rest in the air, taking the form of a woman. \u201CYou did it. What happened?\u201D\r\nKaladin shook his head, holding his breath. Something was surging within him, like\u2026\r\nLike a storm. Raging inside his veins, a tempest sweeping about inside his chest cavity. It made him want to run, jump, yell. It almost made him want to burst. He felt as if he could walk on air. Or walls.\r\nYes!he thought. He broke into a run, leaping at the side of the chasm. He hit feetfirst.\r\nThen bounced off and slammed back into the ground. He was so stunned that he cried out, and he felt the storm within dampen as breath escaped.\r\nHe lay on his back as Stormlight rose from him more quickly now that he was breathing. He lay there as the last of it burned away.\r\nSyl landed on his chest. \u201CKaladin? What was that?\u201D\r\n\u201CMe being an idiot,\u201D he replied, sitting up and feeling an ache in his back and a sharp pain in his elbow where he\u2019d hit the ground. \u201CTeft said that the Radiants were able to walk on walls, and I felt so alive\u2026.\u201D\r\nSyl walked on air, stepping as if down a set of stairs. \u201CI don\u2019t think you\u2019re ready for that yet. Don\u2019t be so risky. If you die, I go stupid again, you know.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll try to keep that in mind,\u201D Kaladin said, climbing to his feet. \u201CMaybe I\u2019ll remove dying from my list of tasks to do this week.\u201D\r\nShe snorted, zipping into the air, becoming a ribbon again. \u201CCome on, hurry up.\u201D She shot off down the chasm. Kaladin collected the dun sphere, then dug into the pouch for another one to provide light. Had he drained them all? No. The others still glowed strongly. He selected a ruby mark, then hurried after Syl.\r\nShe led him to a narrow chasm that contained a small group of fresh Parshendi corpses. \u201CThis is morbid, Kaladin,\u201D Syl noted, standing above the bodies.\r\n\u201CI know. Do you know where Lopen went?\u201D\r\n\u201CI sent him scavenging nearby, fetching the things you asked him for.\u201D\r\n\u201CBring him, please.\u201D\r\nSyl sighed, but zipped away. She always got testy when he made her appear to someone other than him. Kaladin knelt down. Parshendi all looked so similar. That same square face, those blocky\u2014almost rocklike\u2014features. Some had the beards with bits of gemstone tied in them. Those glowed, but not brightly. Cut gemstones held Stormlight better. Why was that?\r\nRumors in camp claimed that the Parshendi took the wounded humans away and ate them. Rumors also said they left their dead, not caring for the fallen, never building them proper pyres. But that last part was false. They did care about their dead. They all seemed to have the same sensibility that Shen did; he threw a fit every time one of the bridgemen so much as touched a Parshendi corpse.\r\nI\u2019d better be right about this,Kaladin thought grimly, slipping a knife off one of the Parshendi bodies. It was beautifully ornamented and forged, the steel lined with glyphs Kaladin didn\u2019t recognize. He began to cut at the strange breastplate armor that grew from the corpse\u2019s chest.\r\nKaladin quickly determined that Parshendi physiology was very different from human physiology. Small blue ligaments held the breastplate to the skin underneath. It was attached all the way across. He continued working. There wasn\u2019t much blood; it had pooled at the corpse\u2019s back or leaked away. His knife wasn\u2019t a surgeon\u2019s tool, but it did the job just fine. By the time Syl returned with Lopen, Kaladin had gotten the breastplate free and had moved on to the carapace helm. It was harder to remove; it had grown into the skull in places, and he had to saw with the serrated section of the blade.\r\n\u201CHo, gancho,\u201D Lopen said, a sack slung over his shoulder. \u201CYou don\u2019t like them at all, do you?\u201D\r\nKaladin stood, wiping his hands on the Parshendi man\u2019s skirt. \u201CDid you find what I asked for?\u201D\r\n\u201CSure did,\u201D Lopen said, letting down the sack and digging into it. He pulled out an armored leather vest and cap, the type that spearmen used. Then he took out some thin leather straps and a medium-sized wooden spearman\u2019s shield. Finally came a series of deep red bones. Parshendi bones. At the very bottom of the sack was the rope, the one Lopen had bought and tossed into the chasm, then stashed down below.\r\n\u201CYou haven\u2019t lost your wits, have you?\u201D Lopen asked, eyeing the bones. \u201CBecause if you have, I\u2019ve got a cousin who makes this drink for people who\u2019ve lost their wits, and it might make you better, sure.\u201D\r\n\u201CIf I\u2019d lost my wits,\u201D Kaladin said, walking over to a pool of still water to wash off the carapace helm, \u201Cwould I say that I had?\u201D\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know,\u201D Lopen said, leaning back. \u201CMaybe. Guess it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re crazy or not.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou\u2019d follow a crazy man into battle?\u201D\r\n\u201CSure,\u201D Lopen said. \u201CIf you\u2019re crazy, you\u2019re a good type, and I like you. Not a killing-people-in-their-sleep type of crazy.\u201D He smiled. \u201CBesides. We all follow crazies all the time. Do it every day with lighteyes.\u201D\r\nKaladin chuckled.\r\n\u201CSo what\u2019s this all for?\u201D\r\nKaladin didn\u2019t answer. He brought the breastplate over to the leather vest, then tied it onto the front with some of the leather straps. He did the same with the cap and the helm, though he eventually had to saw some grooves into the helm with his knife to make it stay.\r\nOnce done, Kaladin used the last straps to tie the bones together and attach them to the front of the round wooden shield. The bones rattled as he lifted the shield, but he decided it was good enough.\r\nHe took shield, cap, and breastplate and put them all into Lopen\u2019s sack. They barely fit. \u201CAll right,\u201D he said, standing up. \u201CSyl, lead us to the short chasm.\u201D They\u2019d spent some time investigating, finding the best place to launch arrows into the bottom of permanent bridges. One bridge in particular was close to Sadeas\u2019s warcamp\u2014so they often traversed it on the way out on a bridge run\u2014and spanned a particularly shallow chasm. Only about forty feet deep, rather than the usual hundred or more.\r\nShe nodded, then zipped away, leading them there. Kaladin and Lopen followed. Teft had orders to lead the others back and meet Kaladin at the base of the ladder, but Kaladin and Lopen should be far ahead of them. He spent the hike listening with half an ear as Lopen talked about his extended family.\r\nThe more Kaladin thought about what he was planning, the more brazen it seemed. Perhaps Lopen was right to question his sanity. But Kaladin had tried being rational. He\u2019d tried being careful. That had failed; now there wasn\u2019t any more time for logic or care. Hashal obviously intended Bridge Four to be exterminated.\r\nWhen clever, careful plans failed, it was time to try something desperate.\r\nLopen cut off suddenly. Kaladin hesitated. The Herdazian man had grown pale-faced and frozen in place. What was\u2026\r\nScraping. Kaladin froze as well, a panic rising in him. One of the side corridors echoed with a deep grinding sound. Kaladin turned slowly, just in time to catch sight of something large\u2014no, something\r\nenormous\u2014 moving down the distant chasm. Shadows in the dim light, the sound of chitinous legs scratching on rock. Kaladin held his breath, sweating, but the beast didn\u2019t come in their direction.\r\nThe scraping grew softer, then eventually faded. He and Lopen stood immobile for a long time after the last sound had vanished.\r\nFinally, Lopen spoke. \u201CGuess the nearby ones aren\u2019t all dead, eh, gancho?\u201D\r\n\u201CYeah,\u201D Kaladin said. He jumped suddenly as Syl zipped back to find them. He unconsciously sucked in Stormlight as he did so, and when she alighted in the air, she found him sheepishly glowing.\r\n\u201CWhat is going on?\u201D she demanded, hands on hips.\r\n\u201CChasmfiend,\u201D Kaladin said.\r\n\u201CReally?\u201D She sounded excited. \u201CWe should chase after it!\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat?\u201D\r\n\u201CSure,\u201D she said. \u201CYou could fight it, I\u2019ll bet.\u201D\r\n\u201CSyl\u2026\u201D\r\nHer eyes were twinkling with amusement. Just a joke. \u201CCome on.\u201D She zipped away.\r\nHe and Lopen stepped more softly now. Eventually Syl landed on the side of the chasm, standing there as if in mockery of when Kaladin had tried to walk up the wall.\r\nKaladin looked up at the shadow of a wooden bridge forty feet above. This was the shallowest chasm they\u2019d been able to find; they tended to get deeper and deeper the farther eastward you went. More and more, he was certain that trying to escape to the east was impossible. It was too far, and surviving the highstorm floods was too difficult a challenge. The original plan\u2014fighting or bribing the guards, then running\u2014was the best one.\r\nBut they needed to live long enough to try that. The bridge above offered an opportunity, if Kaladin could reach it. He hefted his small bag of spheres and his slung sack full of armor and bones over his shoulder. He\u2019d originally intended to have Rock shoot an arrow with a rope tied to it over the bridge, then back down into the chasm. With some men holding one end, another could have climbed up and tied the sack to the bridge\u2019s underside.\r\nBut that would risk letting an arrow shoot out of the chasm where scouts could see. They were said to be very keen-eyed, as the armies depended on them to spot chasmfiends making chrysalises.\r\nKaladin thought he had a better way than the arrow. Maybe. \u201CWe need rocks,\u201D he said. \u201CFist-size ones. A lot of them.\u201D\r\nLopen shrugged and began searching about. Kaladin joined him, fishing them out of puddles and pulling them from crevasses. There was no shortage of stones in the chasms. In a short time, he had a large pile of rocks in a sack.\r\nHe took the pouch of spheres in his hand and tried to think the same way he had earlier, when he\u2019d drawn in the Stormlight.\r\nThis is our last chance.\r\n\u201CLife before death,\u201D he whispered. \u201CStrength before weakness. Journey before destination.\u201D\r\nThe First Ideal of the Knights Radiant. He breathed in deeply, and a thick jolt of power shot up his arm. His muscles burned with energy, with the desire to move. The tempest spread within, pushing at his skin, causing his blood to pump in a powerful rhythm. He opened his eyes. Glowing smoke rose around him. He was able to contain much of the Light, holding it in by holding his breath.\r\nIt\u2019s like a storm inside me.It felt as if it would rip him apart.\r\nHe set the sack with the armor on the ground, but wound the rope around his arm and tied the sack of rocks to his belt. He took out a single fist-size stone and hefted it, feeling its storm-smoothed sides.\r\nThis had better work\u2026.\r\nHe infused the stone with Stormlight, frost crystallizing on his arm. He wasn\u2019t sure how he did it, but it felt natural, like pouring liquid into a cup. Light seemed to pool underneath the skin of his hand, then transfer to the rock\u2014as if he were painting it with a vibrant, glowing liquid.\r\nHe pressed the stone to the rock wall. It fixed in place, leaking Stormlight, clinging so strongly that he couldn\u2019t pry it free. He tested his weight on it, and it held. He placed another one a little lower, then another a little higher. Then, wishing he had someone to burn him a prayer for success, he started climbing.\r\nHe tried not to think about what he was doing. Climbing on rocks stuck to the wall by\u2026 what? Light? Spren? He kept on going. It was a lot like climbing the stone formations back near Hearthstone with Tien, except that he could make handholds exactly where he wanted.\r\nShould have found some rock dust to cover my hands,he thought, pulling himself up, then taking another stone from his sack and sticking it into place.\r\nSyl walked along beside him, her casual stroll seeming to mock the difficulty of his climb. As he shifted his weight to another rock, he heard an ominous click from below. He risked a glance downward. The first of his rocks had fallen free. The ones near it were leaking Stormlight only faintly now.\r\nThe rocks led up toward him like a set of burning footprints. The storm inside him had quieted, though it still blew and raged inside his veins, thrilling and distracting at the same time. What would happen if he ran out of Light before he reached the top?\r\nThe next rock fell free. The one beside it followed a few seconds later. Lopen stood on the other side of the chasm bottom, leaning against the wall, interested but relaxed.\r\nKeep moving!Kaladin thought, annoyed at himself for getting distracted. He turned back to his work.\r\nJust as his arms were beginning to burn from the climb, he reached the underside of the bridge. He reached out as two more of his stones fell free. The clatter of each one was louder now, as they fell a much larger distance.\r\nSteadying himself on the bottom of the bridge with one hand, feet still pushing against the highest rocks, he looped the end of the rope around a wooden bridge support. He pulled it around and threaded it through again to make a makeshift knot. He left plenty of extra rope on the short end.\r\nHe let the rest of the rope slide free of his shoulder and drop to the floor below. \u201CLopen,\u201D he called. Light steamed from his mouth as he spoke. \u201CPull it tight.\u201D\r\nThe Herdazian did so, and Kaladin held to his end, making the knot firm. Then he took hold of the long section of rope and let himself swing free, dangling from the bottom of the bridge. The knot held.\r\nKaladin relaxed. He was still steaming light, and\u2014save for the call to Lopen\u2014he\u2019d been holding his breath for a good quarter hour.\r\nThat could be handy,he thought, though his lungs were starting to burn, so he started to breathe normally. The Light didn\u2019t leave him altogether, though it escaped faster.\r\n\u201CAll right,\u201D Kaladin said to Lopen. \u201CTie the other sack to the bottom of the rope.\u201D\r\nThe rope wiggled, and a few moments later Lopen called up that it was done. Kaladin gripped the rope with his legs to hold himself in place, then used his hands to pull up the length underneath, hoisting up the sack full of armor. Using the rope on the short end of the knot, he slipped his pouch of dun spheres into the sack with the armor, then tied it into place underneath the bridge where\u2014he hoped\u2014Lopen and Dabbid would be able to get to it from above.\r\nHe looked down. The ground looked so much more distant than it would have from the bridge above. From this slightly different perspective, everything changed.\r\nHe didn\u2019t get vertigo from the height. Instead, he felt a little surge of excitement. Something about him had always liked being up high. It felt natural. It was being below\u2014trapped in holes and unable to see the world\u2014 that was depressing.\r\nHe considered his next move.\r\n\u201CWhat?\u201D Syl asked, stepping up to him, standing on air.\r\n\u201CIf I leave the rope here, someone might spot it while crossing the bridge.\u201D\r\n\u201CSo cut it free.\u201D\r\nHe looked at her, raising an eyebrow. \u201CWhile dangling from it?\u201D\r\n\u201CYou\u2019ll be fine.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s a forty-foot drop! I\u2019d break bones at the very least.\u201D\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D Syl said. \u201CI feel\r\nrightabout this, Kaladin. You\u2019ll be fine. Trust me.\u201D\r\n\u201CTrust you? Syl, you\u2019ve said yourself that your memory is fractured!\u201D\r\n\u201CYou insulted me the other week,\u201D she said, folding her arms. \u201CI think you owe me an apology.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m supposed to apologize by cutting a rope and dropping forty feet?\u201D\r\n\u201CNo, you apologize by trusting me. I told you. I feel right about this.\u201D\r\nHe sighed, looking down again. His Stormlight was running out. What else could he do? Leaving the rope would be foolish. Could he tie it in another knot, one he could shake free once at the bottom?\r\nIf that type of knot existed, he didn\u2019t know how to tie it. He clenched his teeth. Then, as the last of his rocks fell off and clattered to the ground, he took a deep breath and pulled out the Parshendi knife he\u2019d taken earlier. He moved swiftly, before he had a chance to reconsider, and sliced the rope free.\r\nHe dropped in a rush, one hand still holding the sliced rope, stomach lurching with the jarring distress of falling. The bridge shot away as if rising, and Kaladin\u2019s panicked mind immediately sent his eyes downward. This wasn\u2019t beautiful. This was terrifying. It was horrible. He was going to die! He\u2014\r\nIt\u2019s all right.\r\nHis emotions calmed in a heartbeat. Somehow, he knew what to do. He\u00A0twisted in the air, dropping the rope and hitting the ground with both feet down. He came to a crouch, resting one hand on the stone, a jolt of coldness shooting through him. His remaining Stormlight came out in a single burst, flung from his body in a luminescent smoke ring that crashed against the ground before spreading out, vanishing.\r\nHe stood up straight. Lopen gaped. Kaladin felt an ache in his legs from hitting, but it was like that of having leaped four or five feet.\r\n\u201CLike ten crashes of thunder on the mounts, gancho!\u201D Lopen exclaimed. \u201CThat was incredible!\u201D\r\n\u201CThank you,\u201D Kaladin said. He raised a hand to his head, glancing at the rocks scattered about the base of the wall, then looking up at the armor tied securely up above.\r\n\u201CI told you,\u201D Syl said, landing on his shoulder. She sounded triumphant.\r\n\u201CLopen,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CYou think you can get that bundle of armor during the next bridge run?\u201D\r\n\u201CSure,\u201D Lopen said. \u201CNobody will see. They ignore us Herdies, they ignore bridgemen, and they especially ignore cripples. To them, I\u2019m so invisible I should be walking through walls.\u201D\r\nKaladin nodded. \u201CGet it. Hide it. Give it to me right before the final plateau assault.\u201D\r\n\u201CThey aren\u2019t going to like you going into a bridge run armored, gancho,\u201D Lopen said. \u201CI don\u2019t think this will be any different from what you tried before.\u201D\r\n\u201CWe\u2019ll see,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CJust do it.\u201D"

      "ChapterName": "60: THAT WHICH WE CANNOT HAVE",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\n\u201CThe death is my life, the strength becomes my weakness, the journey has ended.\u201D\r\n\u2014Dated Betabanes, 1173, 95 seconds pre-death. Subject: a scholar of some minor renown. Sample collected secondhand. Considered questionable.\r\n\u201CThat is why, Father,\u201D Adolin said, \u201Cyou absolutely\r\ncannotabdicate to me, no matter\r\nwhatwe discover with the visions.\u201D\r\n\u201CIs that so?\u201D Dalinar asked, smiling to himself.\r\n\u201CYes.\u201D\r\n\u201CVery well, you\u2019ve convinced me.\u201D\r\nAdolin stopped dead in the hallway. The two of them were on their way to Dalinar\u2019s chambers. Dalinar turned and looked back at the younger man. \u201CReally?\u201D Adolin asked. \u201CI mean, I actually\r\nwonan argument with you?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CYour points are valid.\u201D He didn\u2019t add that he\u2019d come to the decision on his own. \u201CNo matter what, I will stay. I can\u2019t leave this fight now.\u201D\r\nAdolin smiled broadly.\r\n\u201CBut,\u201D Dalinar said, raising a finger. \u201CI have a requirement. I will draft an order\u2014notarized by the highest of my scribes and witnessed by Elhokar\u2014 that gives you the right to depose me, should I grow too mentally unstable. We won\u2019t let the other camps know of it, but I will not risk letting myself grow so crazy that it\u2019s impossible to remove me.\u201D\r\n\u201CAll right,\u201D Adolin said, walking up to Dalinar. They were alone in the hallway. \u201CI can accept that. Assuming you don\u2019t tell Sadeas about it. I still don\u2019t trust him.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m not asking you to trust him,\u201D Dalinar said pushing the door open to his chambers. \u201CYou just need to believe that he is capable of changing. Sadeas was once a friend, and I think he can be again.\u201D\r\nThe cool stones of the Soulcast chamber seemed to hold the chill of the spring weather. It continued to refuse to slip into summer, but at least it hadn\u2019t slid into winter either. Elthebar promised that it would not do so\u2014but, then, the stormwarden\u2019s promises were always filled with caveats. The Almighty\u2019s will was mysterious, and the signs couldn\u2019t always be trusted.\r\nHe accepted stormwardens now, though when they\u2019d first grown popular, he\u2019d rejected their aid. No man should try to know the future, nor lay claim to it, for it belonged only to the Almighty himself. And Dalinar wondered how stormwardens could do their research without reading. They claimed they didn\u2019t, but he\u2019d seen their books filled with glyphs. Glyphs. They weren\u2019t meant to be used in books; they were pictures. A man who had never seen one before could still understand what one meant, based on its shape. That made interpreting glyphs different from reading.\r\nStormwardens did a lot of things that made people uncomfortable. Unfortunately, they were just so\r\nuseful. Knowing when a highstorm might strike, well, that was just too tempting an advantage. Even though stormwardens were frequently wrong, they were more often right.\r\nRenarin knelt beside the hearth, inspecting the fabrial that had been installed there to warm the room. Navani had already arrived. She sat at Dalinar\u2019s elevated writing desk, scribbling a letter; she waved a distracted greeting with her reed as Dalinar entered. She wore the fabrial he had seen her displaying at the feast a few weeks back; the multilegged contraption was attached to her shoulder, gripping the cloth of her violet dress.\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know, Father,\u201D Adolin said, closing the door. Apparently he was still thinking about Sadeas. \u201CI don\u2019t care if he\u2019s listening to\r\nThe Way of Kings. He\u2019s just doing it to make you look less closely at the plateau assaults so that his clerks can arrange his cut of the gemhearts more favorably. He\u2019s manipulating you.\u201D\r\nDalinar shrugged. \u201CGemhearts are secondary, son. If I can reforge an alliance with him, then it\u2019s worth nearly any cost. In a way, I\u2019m the one manipulating him.\u201D\r\nAdolin sighed. \u201CVery well. But I\u2019m still going to keep a hand on my money pouch when he\u2019s near.\u201D\r\n\u201CJust try not to insult him,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201COh, and something else. I would like you to take extra care with the King\u2019s Guard. If there are soldiers we know for certain are loyal to me, put those in charge of guarding Elhokar\u2019s rooms. His words about a conspiracy have me worried.\u201D\r\n\u201CSurely you don\u2019t give them credence,\u201D Adolin said.\r\n\u201CSomething odd did happen with his armor. This whole mess stinks like cremslime. Perhaps it will turn out to be nothing. For now, humor me.\u201D\r\n\u201CI have to note,\u201D Navani said, \u201Cthat I didn\u2019t much care for Sadeas back when you, he, and Gavilar were friends.\u201D She finished her letter with a flourish.\r\n\u201CHe\u2019s not behind the attacks on the king,\u201D Dalinar said.\r\n\u201CHow can you be certain?\u201D Navani asked.\r\n\u201CBecause it\u2019s not his way,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CSadeas never wanted the title of king. Being highprince gives him plenty of power, but leaves him with someone to take the blame for large-scale mistakes.\u201D Dalinar shook his head. \u201CHe never tried to seize the throne from Gavilar, and he\u2019s even better positioned with Elhokar.\u201D\r\n\u201CBecause my son\u2019s a weakling,\u201D Navani said. It wasn\u2019t an accusation.\r\n\u201CHe\u2019s\r\nnotweak,\u201D Dalinar said, \u201CHe\u2019s inexperienced. But yes, that does make the situation ideal for Sadeas. He\u2019s telling the truth\u2014he asked to be Highprince of Information because he wants very badly to find out who is trying to kill Elhokar.\u201D\r\n\u201CMashala,\u201D Renarin said, using the formal term for aunt. \u201CThat fabrial on your shoulder, what does it do?\u201D\r\nNavani looked down at the device with a sly smile. Dalinar could see she\u2019d been hoping one of them would ask. Dalinar sat down; the highstorm would be coming soon.\r\n\u201COh, this? It\u2019s a type of painrial. Here, let me show you.\u201D She reached up with her safehand, pushing a clip that released the clawlike legs. She held it up. \u201CDo you have any aches, dear? A stubbed toe, perhaps, or a scrape?\u201D\r\nRenarin shook his head.\r\n\u201CI pulled a muscle in my hand during dueling practice earlier,\u201D Adolin said. \u201CIt\u2019s not bad, but it does ache.\u201D\r\n\u201CCome over here,\u201D Navani said. Dalinar smiled fondly\u2014Navani was always at her most genuine when playing with new fabrials. It was one of the few times when one got to see her without any pretense. This wasn\u2019t Navani the king\u2019s mother or Navani the political schemer. This was Navani the excited engineer.\r\n\u201CThe artifabrian community is doing some amazing things,\u201D Navani said as Adolin proffered his hand. \u201CI\u2019m particularly proud of this little device, as I had a hand in its construction.\u201D She clipped it onto Adolin\u2019s hand, wrapping the clawlike legs around the palm and locking them into place.\r\nAdolin raised his hand, turning it around. \u201CThe pain is gone.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut you can still feel, correct?\u201D Navani said in a self-satisfied way.\r\nAdolin prodded his palm with the fingers of his other hand. \u201CThe hand isn\u2019t numb at all.\u201D\r\nRenarin watched with keen interest, bespectacled eyes curious, intense. If only the lad could be persuaded to become an ardent. He could be an engineer then, if he wanted. And yet he refused. His reasons always seemed like poor excuses to Dalinar.\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s kind of bulky,\u201D Dalinar noted.\r\n\u201CWell, it\u2019s just an early model,\u201D Navani said defensively. \u201CI was working backward from one of those dreadful creations of Longshadow\u2019s, and I didn\u2019t have the luxury of refining the shape. I think it has a lot of potential. Imagine a few of these on a battlefield to dull the pain of wounded soldiers. Imagine it in the hands of a surgeon, who wouldn\u2019t have to worry about his patients\u2019 pain while working on them.\u201D\r\nAdolin nodded. Dalinar had to admit, it did sound like a useful device.\r\nNavani smiled. \u201CThis is a special time to be alive; we\u2019re learning all kinds of things about fabrials. This, for instance, is a diminishing fabrial\u2014 it decreases something, in this case pain. It doesn\u2019t actually make the wound any better, but it might be a step in that direction. Either way, it\u2019s a completely different type from paired fabrials like the spanreeds. If you could see the plans we have for the future\u2026\u201D\r\n\u201CLike what?\u201D Adolin asked.\r\n\u201CYou\u2019ll find out eventually,\u201D Navani said, smiling mysteriously. She removed the fabrial from Adolin\u2019s hand.\r\n\u201CShardblades?\u201D Adolin sounded excited.\r\n\u201CWell, no,\u201D Navani said. \u201CThe design and workings of Shardblades and Plate are completely different from everything we\u2019ve discovered. The closest anyone has are those shields in Jah Keved. But as far as I can tell, they use a completely different design principle from regular Shardplate. The ancients must have had a wondrous grasp of engineering.\u201D\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CI\u2019ve seen them, Navani. They\u2019re\u2026 well, they\u2019re ancient. Their technology is primitive.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd the Dawncities?\u201D Navani asked skeptically. \u201CThe fabrials?\u201D\r\nDalinar shook his head. \u201CI\u2019ve seen neither. There are Shardblades in the visions, but they seem so out of place. Perhaps they were given directly by the Heralds, as the legends say.\u201D\r\n\u201CPerhaps,\u201D Navani said. \u201CWhy don\u2019t\u2014\u201D\r\nShe vanished.\r\nDalinar blinked. He hadn\u2019t heard the highstorm approaching.\r\nHe was now in a large, open room with pillars running along the sides. The enormous pillars looked sculpted of soft sandstone, with unornamented, granular sides. The ceiling was far above, carved from the rock in geometric patterns that looked faintly familiar. Circles connected by lines, spreading outward from one another\u2026\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know what to do, old friend,\u201D a voice said from the side. Dalinar turned to see a youthful man in regal white and gold robes, walking with his hands clasped before him, hidden by voluminous sleeves. He had dark hair pulled back in a braid and a short beard that came to a point. Gold threads were woven into his hair and came together on his forehead to form a golden symbol. The symbol of the Knights Radiant.\r\n\u201CThey say that each time it is the same,\u201D the man said. \u201CWe are never ready for the Desolations. We should be getting better at resisting, but each time we step closer to destruction instead.\u201D He turned to Dalinar, as if expecting a response.\r\nDalinar glanced down. He too wore ornamental robes, though not as lavish. Where was he? What time? He needed to find clues for Navani to record and for Jasnah to use in proving\u2014or disproving\u2014these dreams.\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know what to say either,\u201D Dalinar responded. If he wanted information, he needed to act more natural than he had in previous visions.\r\nThe regal man sighed. \u201CI had hoped you would have wisdom to share with me, Karm.\u201D They continued walking toward the side of the room, approaching a place where the wall split into a massive balcony with a stone railing. It looked out upon an evening sky; the setting sun stained the air a dirty, sultry red.\r\n\u201COur own natures destroy us,\u201D the regal man said, voice soft, though his face was angry. \u201CAlakavish was a Surgebinder. He should have known better. And yet, the Nahel bond gave him no more wisdom than a regular man. Alas, not all spren are as discerning as honorspren.\u201D\r\n\u201CI agree,\u201D Dalinar said.\r\nThe other man looked relieved. \u201CI worried that you would find my claims too forward. Your own Surgebinders were\u2026 But, no, we should not look backward.\u201D\r\nWhat\u2019s a Surgebinder?Dalinar wanted to scream the question out, but there was no way. Not without sounding completely out of place.\r\nPerhaps\u2026\r\n\u201CWhat do you think should be done with these Surgebinders?\u201D Dalinar asked carefully.\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know if we can force them to do anything.\u201D Their footsteps echoed in the empty room. Were there no guards, no attendants? \u201CTheir power\u2026 well, Alakavish proves the allure that Surgebinders have for the common people. If only there were a way to encourage them\u2026.\u201D The man stopped, turning to Dalinar. \u201CThey need to be better, old friend. We all do. The responsibility of what we\u2019ve been given\u2014whether it be the crown or the Nahel bond\u2014needs to make\r\nusbetter.\u201D\r\nHe seemed to expect something from Dalinar. But what?\r\n\u201CI can read your disagreement in your face,\u201D the regal man said. \u201CIt\u2019s all right, Karm. I realize that my thoughts on this subject are unconventional. Perhaps the rest of you are right, perhaps our abilities are proof of a divine election. But if this is true, should we not be more wary of how we act?\u201D\r\nDalinar frowned. That sounded familiar to him. The regal man sighed, walking to the balcony lip. Dalinar joined him, stepping outside. The perspective finally allowed him to look down on the landscape below.\r\nThousands of corpses confronted him.\r\nDalinar gasped. Dead filled the streets of the city outside, a city that Dalinar vaguely recognized.\r\nKholinar,he thought.\r\nMy homeland.He stood with the regal man at the top of a low tower, three stories high\u2014a keep of some sort, constructed of stone. It seemed to sit where the palace would someday be.\r\nThe city was unmistakable, with its peaked stone formations rising like enormous fins into the air. The windblades, they were called. But they were less weathered than he was accustomed to, and the city around them was very different. Built of blocky stone structures, many of which had been knocked down. The destruction spread far, lining the sides of primitive streets. Had the city been hit by an earthquake?\r\nNo, those corpses had fallen in battle. Dalinar could smell the stench of blood, viscera, smoke. The bodies lay strewn about, many near the low wall that surrounded the keep. The wall was broken in places, smashed. And there were rocks of strange shape mixed about the corpses. Stones cut like\u2026\r\nBlood of my fathers,Dalinar thought, gripping the stone railing, leading forward.\r\nThose aren\u2019t stones. They\u2019re creatures.Massive creatures, easily five or six times the size of a person, their skin dull and grey like granite. They had long limbs and skeletal bodies, the forelegs\u2014or were they arms?\u2014set into wide shoulders. The faces were lean, narrow. Arrowlike.\r\n\u201CWhat happened here?\u201D Dalinar asked despite himself. \u201CIt\u2019s terrible!\u201D\r\n\u201CI ask myself this same thing. How could we let this occur? The Desolations are well named. I\u2019ve heard initial counts. Eleven years of war, and nine out of ten people I once ruled are dead. Do we even have kingdoms to lead any longer? Sur is gone, I\u2019m sure of it. Tarma, Eiliz, they won\u2019t likely survive. Too many of their people have fallen.\u201D\r\nDalinar had never heard of those places.\r\nThe man made a fist, pounding it softly against the railing. Burning stations had been set up in the distance; they had begun cremating the corpses. \u201CThe others want to blame Alakavish. And true, if he hadn\u2019t brought us to war before the Desolation, we might not have been broken this badly. But Alakavish was a symptom of a greater disease. When the Heralds next return, what will they find? A people who have forgotten them yet again? A world torn by war and squabbling? If we continue as we have, then perhaps we\r\ndeserveto lose.\u201D\r\nDalinar felt a chill. He had thought that this vision must come after his previous one, but prior visions hadn\u2019t been chronological. He hadn\u2019t seen any Knights Radiant yet, but that might not be because they had disbanded. Perhaps they didn\u2019t\r\nexistyet. And perhaps there was a reason this man\u2019s words sounded so familiar.\r\nCould it be? Could he really be standing beside the very man whose words Dalinar had listened to time and time again? \u201CThere is honor in loss,\u201D Dalinar said carefully, using words repeated several times in\r\nThe Way of Kings.\r\n\u201CIf that loss brings learning.\u201D The man smiled. \u201CUsing my own sayings against me again, Karm?\u201D\r\nDalinar felt himself grow short of breath. The man himself. Nohadon. The great king. He was real. Or he had been real. This man was younger than Dalinar had imagined him, but that humble, yet regal bearing\u2026 yes, it was right.\r\n\u201CI\u2019m thinking of giving up my throne,\u201D Nohadon said softly.\r\n\u201CNo!\u201D Dalinar stepped toward him. \u201CYou mustn\u2019t.\u201D\r\n\u201CI cannot lead them,\u201D the man said. \u201CNot if this is what my leadership brings them to.\u201D\r\n\u201CNohadon.\u201D\r\nThe man turned to him, frowning. \u201CWhat?\u201D\r\nDalinar paused. Could he be wrong about this man\u2019s identity? But no. The name Nohadon was more of a title. Many famous people in history had been given holy names by the Church, before it was disbanded. Even Bajerden wasn\u2019t likely to be his real name; that was lost in time.\r\n\u201CIt is nothing,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CYou cannot give up your throne. The people need a leader.\u201D\r\n\u201CThey\r\nhaveleaders,\u201D Nohadon said. \u201CThere are princes, kings, Soulcasters, Surgebinders. We never lack men and women who wish to lead.\u201D\r\n\u201CTrue,\u201D Dalinar said, \u201Cbut we do lack ones who are good at it.\u201D\r\nNohadon leaned over the railing. He stared at the fallen, an expression of deep grief\u2014and trouble\u2014on his face. It was so strange to see the man like this. He was so young. Dalinar had never imagined such insecurity, such torment, in him.\r\n\u201CI know that feeling,\u201D Dalinar said softly. \u201CThe uncertainty, the shame, the confusion.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou can read me too well, old friend.\u201D\r\n\u201CI know those emotions because I\u2019ve felt them. I\u2026 I never assumed that you would feel them too.\u201D\r\n\u201CThen I correct myself. Perhaps you don\u2019t know me well enough.\u201D\r\nDalinar fell silent.\r\n\u201CSo what do I do?\u201D Nohadon asked.\r\n\u201CYou\u2019re asking\r\nme?\u201D\r\n\u201CYou\u2019re my advisor, aren\u2019t you? Well, I should like some advice.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2026 You can\u2019t give up your throne.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd what should I do with it?\u201D Nohadon turned and walked along the long balcony. It seemed to run around this entire level. Dalinar joined him, passing places where the stone was ripped, the railing broken away.\r\n\u201CI haven\u2019t faith in people any longer, old friend,\u201D Nohadon said. \u201CPut two men together, and they will find something to argue about. Gather them into groups, and one group will find reason to oppress or attack another. Now this. How do I protect them? How do I stop this from happening again?\u201D\r\n\u201CYou dictate a book,\u201D Dalinar said eagerly. \u201CA grand book to give people hope, to explain your philosophy on leadership and how lives should be lived!\u201D\r\n\u201CA book? Me. Write a book?\u201D\r\n\u201CWhy not?\u201D\r\n\u201CBecause it\u2019s a fantastically\r\nstupididea.\u201D\r\nDalinar\u2019s jaw dropped.\r\n\u201CThe world as we know it has quite nearly been destroyed,\u201D Nohadon said. \u201CBarely a family exists that hasn\u2019t lost half its members! Our best men are corpses on that field, and we haven\u2019t food to last more than two or three months at best. And I\u2019m to spend my time writing a book? Who would scribe it for me? All of my wordsmen were slaughtered when Yelignar broke into the chancery. You\u2019re the only man of letters I know of who\u2019s still alive.\u201D\r\nA\r\nmanof letters? This\r\nwasan odd time. \u201CI could write it, then.\u201D\r\n\u201CWith one arm? Have you learned to write left-handed, then?\u201D\r\nDalinar looked down. He had both of his arms, though apparently the man Nohadon saw was missing his right.\r\n\u201CNo, we need to rebuild,\u201D Nohadon said. \u201CI just wish there were a way to convince the kings\u2014the ones still alive\u2014not to seek advantage over one another.\u201D Nohadon tapped the balcony. \u201CSo this is my decision. Step down, or do what is needed. This isn\u2019t a time for writing. It\u2019s a time for action. And then, unfortunately, a time for the sword.\u201D\r\nThe sword?Dalinar thought.\r\nFrom you, Nohadon?\r\nIt wouldn\u2019t happen. This man would become a great philosopher; he would teach peace and reverence for others, and would not force men to do as he wished. He would\r\nguidethem to acting with honor.\r\nNohadon turned to Dalinar. \u201CI apologize, Karm. I should not dismiss your suggestions right after asking for them. I\u2019m on edge, as I imagine that we all are. At times, it seems to me that to be human is to want that which we cannot have. For some, this is power. For me, it is peace.\u201D\r\nNohadon turned, walking back down the balcony. Though his pace was slow, his posture indicated that he wished to be alone. Dalinar let him go.\r\n\u201CHe goes on to become one of the most influential writers Roshar has ever known,\u201D Dalinar said.\r\nThere was silence, save for the calls of the people working below, gathering the corpses.\r\n\u201CI know you\u2019re there,\u201D Dalinar said.\r\nSilence.\r\n\u201CWhat does he decide?\u201D Dalinar asked. \u201CDid he unite them, as he wanted?\u201D\r\nThe voice that often spoke in his visions did not come. Dalinar received no answer to his questions. He sighed, turning to look out over the fields of dead.\r\n\u201CYou are right about one thing, at least, Nohadon. To be human is to want that which we cannot have.\u201D\r\nThe landscape darkened, the sun setting. That darkness enveloped him, and he closed his eyes. When he opened them, he was back in his rooms, standing with his hands on the back of a chair. He turned to Adolin and Renarin, who stood nearby, anxious, prepared to grab him if he got violent.\r\n\u201CWell,\u201D Dalinar said, \u201Cthat was meaningless. I learned nothing. Blast! I\u2019m doing a poor job of\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CDalinar,\u201D Navani said curtly, still scribbling with a reed at her paper. \u201CThe last thing you said before the vision ended. What was it?\u201D\r\nDalinar frowned. \u201CThe last\u2026\u201D\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D Navani said, urgent. \u201CThe very last words you spoke.\u201D\r\n\u201CI was quoting the man I\u2019d been speaking with. \u2018To be human is to want that which we cannot have.\u2019 Why?\u201D\r\nShe ignored him, writing furiously. Once done, she slid off the high-legged chair, hurrying to his bookshelf. \u201CDo you have a copy of\u2026 Yes, I thought you might. These are Jasnah\u2019s books, aren\u2019t they?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CShe wanted them cared for until she returned.\u201D\r\nNavani pulled a volume off the shelf. \u201CCorvana\u2019s\r\nAnalectics.\u201D She set the volume on the writing desk and leafed through the pages.\r\nDalinar joined her, though\u2014of course\u2014he couldn\u2019t make sense of the page. \u201CWhat does it matter?\u201D\r\n\u201CHere,\u201D Navani said. She looked up at Dalinar. \u201CWhen you go into these visions of yours, you know that you speak.\u201D\r\n\u201CGibberish. Yes, my sons have told me.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnak malah kaf, del makian habin yah,\u201DNavani said. \u201CSound familiar?\u201D\r\nDalinar shook his head, baffled.\r\n\u201CIt sounds a lot like what father was saying,\u201D Renarin said. \u201CWhen he was in the vision.\u201D\r\n\u201CNot \u2018a lot like\u2019 Renarin,\u201D Navani said, looking smug. \u201CIt\u2019s exactly the same phrase. That is the last thing you said before coming out of your trance. I wrote down everything\u2014as best I could\u2014that you babbled today.\u201D\r\n\u201CFor what purpose?\u201D Dalinar asked.\r\n\u201CBecause,\u201D Navani said \u201CI thought it might be helpful. And it was. The same phrase is in the\r\nAnalectics, almost exactly.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat?\u201D Dalinar asked, incredulous. \u201CHow?\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s a line from a song,\u201D Navani said. \u201CA chant by the Vanrial, an order of artists who live on the slopes of the Silent Mount in Jah Keved. Year after year, century after century, they\u2019ve sung these same words\u2014songs they claim were written in the Dawnchant by the Heralds themselves. They have the words of those songs, written in an ancient script. But the\r\nmeaningshave been lost. They\u2019re just sounds, now. Some scholars believe that the script\u2014and the songs themselves\u2014may indeed be in the Dawnchant.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd I\u2026\u201D Dalinar said.\r\n\u201CYou just spoke a line from one of them,\u201D Navani said. \u201CBeyond that, if the phrase you just gave me is correct, you\r\ntranslatedit. This could prove the Vanrial Hypothesis! One sentence isn\u2019t much, but it could give us the key to translating the entire script. It has been itching at me for a while, listening to these visions. I\r\nthoughtthe things you were saying had too much order to be gibberish.\u201D She looked at Dalinar, smiling deeply. \u201CDalinar, you might just have cracked one of the most perplexing\u2014and ancient\u2014 mysteries of all time.\u201D\r\n\u201CWait,\u201D Adolin said. \u201CWhat are you saying?\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat I\u2019m saying, nephew,\u201D Navani said, looking directly at him, \u201Cis that we have your proof.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut,\u201D Adolin said. \u201CI mean, he could have heard that one phrase\u2026\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd extrapolated an entire language from it?\u201D Navani said, holding up a sheet full of writings. \u201CThis\r\nis notgibberish, but it\u2019s no language that people now speak. I suspect it is what it seems, the Dawnchant. So unless you can think of another way your father learned to speak a dead language, Adolin, the visions are most certainly real.\u201D\r\nThe room fell silent. Navani herself looked stunned by what she had said. She shook it off quickly. \u201CNow, Dalinar,\u201D she said, \u201CI want you to describe this vision as accurately as possible. I need the exact words you spoke, if you can recall them. Every bit we gather will help my scholars sort through this\u2026.\u201D"

      "ChapterName": "61: RIGHT FOR WRONG",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\n\u201CIn the storm I awaken, falling, spinning, grieving.\u201D\r\n\u2014Dated Kakanev, 1173, 13 seconds pre-death. Subject was a city guardsman.\r\n\u201CHow can you be so sure it was him, Dalinar?\u201D Navani asked softly.\r\nDalinar shook his head. \u201CI just am. That was Nohadon.\u201D\r\nIt had been several hours since the end of the vision. Navani had left her writing table to sit in a more comfortable chair near Dalinar. Renarin sat across from him, accompanying them for propriety\u2019s sake. Adolin had left to get the highstorm damage report. The lad had seemed very disturbed by the discovery that the visions were real.\r\n\u201CBut the man you saw never spoke his name,\u201D Navani said.\r\n\u201CIt was him, Navani.\u201D Dalinar stared toward the wall over Renarin\u2019s head, looking at the smooth brown Soulcast rock. \u201CThere was an aura of command about him, the weight of great responsibilities. A regality.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt could have been some other king,\u201D she said. \u201CAfter all, he discarded your suggestion that he write a book.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt just wasn\u2019t the time for him to write it yet. So much death\u2026 He was cast down by some great loss. Stormfather! Nine out of ten people dead in war. Can you imagine such a thing?\u201D\r\n\u201CThe Desolations,\u201D Navani said.\r\nUnite the people\u2026. The True Desolation comes\u2026.\r\n\u201CDo you know of any references to the Desolations?\u201D Dalinar asked. \u201CNot the tales ardents tell. Historical references?\u201D\r\nNavani held a cup of warmed violet wine in her hand, beads of condensation on the rim of the glass. \u201CYes, but I am the wrong one to ask. Jasnah is the historian.\u201D\r\n\u201CI think I saw the aftermath of one. I\u2026 I may have seen corpses of Voidbringers. Could that give us more proof?\u201D\r\n\u201CNothing nearly as good as the linguistics.\u201D Navani took a sip of her wine. \u201CThe Desolations are matters of ancient lore. It could be argued that you imagined what you expected to see. But those words\u2014if we can translate them, nobody will be able to dispute that you are seeing something real.\u201D Her writing board lay on the low table between them, reed and ink set carefully across the paper.\r\n\u201CYou intend to tell others?\u201D Dalinar asked. \u201COf my visions?\u201D\r\n\u201CHow else will we explain what is happening to you?\u201D\r\nDalinar hesitated. How could he explain? On one hand, it was relieving to know that he was not mad. But what if some force were trying to mislead him with these visions, using images of Nohadon and the Radiants because he would find them trustworthy?\r\nThe Knights Radiant fell,Dalinar reminded himself.\r\nThey abandoned us. Some of the other orders may have turned against us, as the legends say.There was an unsettling edge to all of that. He had another stone in rebuilding the foundation of who he was, but the most important point still remained undecided. Did he trust his visions or not? He couldn\u2019t go back to believing them unquestioningly, not now that Adolin\u2019s challenges had raised real worries in his head.\r\nUntil he knew their source, he felt he shouldn\u2019t spread knowledge of them.\r\n\u201CDalinar,\u201D Navani said, leaning forward. \u201CThe warcamps speak of your episodes. Even the wives of your officers are uncomfortable. They think you fear the storms, or that you have some disease of the mind. This will vindicate you.\u201D\r\n\u201CHow? By making me into some kind of mystic? Many will think that the breeze of these visions blows too close to prophecy.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou see the past, Father,\u201D Renarin said. \u201CThat is not forbidden. And if the Almighty sends them, then how could men question?\u201D\r\n\u201CAdolin and I both spoke with ardents,\u201D Dalinar replied. \u201CThey said it was very unlikely that this would come from the Almighty. If we do decide the visions are to be trusted, many will disagree with me.\u201D\r\nNavani settled back, sipping her wine, safehand lying across her lap. \u201CDalinar, your sons told me that you once sought the Old Magic. Why? What did you ask of the Nightwatcher, and what curse did she give you in return?\u201D\r\n\u201CI told them that shame is my own,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CAnd I will not share it.\u201D\r\nThe room fell silent. The flurries of rain following the highstorm had ceased falling on the roof. \u201CIt might be important,\u201D Navani finally said.\r\n\u201CIt was long ago. Long before the visions began. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s related.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut it could be.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D he admitted. Would that day never stop haunting him? Was not losing all memory of his wife enough?\r\nWhat did Renarin think? Would he condemn his father for such an egregious sin? Dalinar forced himself to look up and meet his son\u2019s bespectacled eyes.\r\nCuriously, Renarin didn\u2019t seem bothered. Just thoughtful.\r\n\u201CI\u2019m sorry you had to discover my shame,\u201D Dalinar said, looking to Navani.\r\nShe waved indifferently. \u201CSoliciting the Old Magic is offensive to the devotaries, but their punishments for the act are never severe. I assume that you didn\u2019t have to do much to be cleansed.\u201D\r\n\u201CThe ardents asked for spheres to give the poor,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CAnd I had to commission a series of prayers. None of that removed the effects or my sense of guilt.\u201D\r\n\u201CI think you\u2019d be surprised at how many devout lighteyes turn to the Old Magic at one point in their lives or another. The ones who can make their way to the Valley, at least. But I\r\ndowonder if this is related.\u201D\r\n\u201CAunt,\u201D Renarin said, turning to her. \u201CI have recently asked for a number of readings about the Old Magic. I agree with his assessment. This does not feel like the work of the Nightwatcher. She gives curses in exchange for granting small desires. Always one curse and one desire. Father, I assume you know what both of those things are?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D he said. \u201CI know exactly what my curse was, and it does not relate to this.\u201D\r\n\u201CThen it is unlikely that the Old Magic is to blame.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CBut your aunt is right to question. The truth is, we don\u2019t have any proof that this came from the Almighty either. Something wants me to know of the Desolations and the Knights Radiant. Perhaps we should start asking ourselves why that is.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat\r\nwerethe Desolations, Aunt?\u201D Renarin asked. \u201CThe ardents talk of the Voidbringers. Of mankind, and the Radiants, and of fighting. But what were they really? Do we know anything specific?\u201D\r\n\u201CThere are folklorists among your father\u2019s clerks who would serve you better in this matter.\u201D\r\n\u201CPerhaps,\u201D Dalinar added, \u201Cbut I\u2019m not sure which of them I can trust.\u201D\r\nNavani paused. \u201CFair enough. Well, from what I understand, there are no primary accounts remaining. This was long, long ago. I do recall that the myth of Parasaphi and Nadris mentions the Desolations.\u201D\r\n\u201CParasaphi,\u201D Renarin said. \u201CShe\u2019s the one who searched out the seedstones.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D Navani replied. \u201CIn order to repopulate her fallen people, she climbed the peaks of Dara\u2014the myth changes, listing different modern mountain ranges as the true peaks of Dara\u2014to find stones touched by the Heralds themselves. She brought them to Nadris on his deathbed and harvested his seed to bring life to the stones. They hatched forth ten children, which she used to found a new nation. Marnah, I believe it was called.\u201D\r\n\u201COrigin of the Makabaki,\u201D Renarin said. \u201CMother told me that story when I was a child.\u201D\r\nDalinar shook his head. \u201CBorn from rocks?\u201D The old stories rarely made much sense to him, although the devotaries had canonized many of them.\r\n\u201CThe story mentions the Desolations at the beginning,\u201D Navani said. \u201CGiving them credit for having wiped out Parasaphi\u2019s people.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut what\r\nwerethey?\u201D\r\n\u201CWars.\u201D Navani took a sip of wine. \u201CThe Voidbringers came again and again, trying to force mankind off Roshar and into Damnation. Just as they once forced mankind\u2014and the Heralds\u2014out of the Tranquiline Halls.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhen were the Knights Radiant founded?\u201D Dalinar asked.\r\nNavani shrugged. \u201CI don\u2019t know. Perhaps they were some military group from a specific kingdom, or perhaps they were originally a mercenary band. That would make it easy to see how they could eventually become tyrants.\u201D\r\n\u201CMy visions don\u2019t imply that they were tyrants,\u201D he said. \u201CPerhaps that is the true purpose of the visions. To make me believe lies about the Radiants. Making me trust them, perhaps trying to lead me to mimic their downfall and betrayal.\u201D\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know,\u201D Navani said, sounding skeptical. \u201CI don\u2019t think you\u2019ve seen anything untrue about the Radiants. The legends tend to agree that the Radiants weren\u2019t always so bad. As much as the legends agree on anything, at least.\u201D\r\nDalinar stood and took her nearly empty cup, then walked over to the serving table and refilled it. Discovering that he was not mad should have helped clear things up, but instead left him more disturbed. What if the Voidbringers were behind the visions? Some stories he heard said that they could possess the bodies of men and make them do evil. Or, if they\r\nwerefrom the Almighty, what was their purpose?\r\n\u201CI need to think on all of this,\u201D he said. \u201CIt has been a long day. Please, if I could be left to my own thoughts now.\u201D\r\nRenarin rose and bowed his head in respect before heading to the door. Navani rose more slowly, sleek dress rustling as she set her cup on the table, then walked over to fetch her pain-drinking fabrial. Renarin left, and Dalinar walked to the doorway, waiting as Navani approached. He didn\u2019t intend to let her trap him alone again. He looked out the doorway. His soldiers were there, and he could see them. Good.\r\n\u201CAren\u2019t you pleased at all?\u201D Navani asked, lingering beside the doorway near him, one hand on the frame.\r\n\u201CPleased?\u201D\r\n\u201CYou aren\u2019t going mad.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd we don\u2019t know if I\u2019m being manipulated or not,\u201D he said. \u201CIn a way, we have more questions now than we had before.\u201D\r\n\u201CThe visions are a blessing,\u201D Navani said, laying her freehand on his arm. \u201CI feel it, Dalinar. Don\u2019t you see how wonderful this is?\u201D\r\nDalinar met her eyes, light violet, beautiful. She was so thoughtful, so clever. How he wished he could trust her completely.\r\nShe has shown me nothing but honor,he thought.\r\nNever speaking a word to anyone else of my intention to abdicate. She hasn\u2019t so much as tried to use my\u00A0visions against me.He felt ashamed that he\u2019d once worried that she might.\r\nShe was a wonderful woman, Navani Kholin. A wonderful, amazing,\r\ndangerouswoman.\r\n\u201CI see more worries,\u201D he said. \u201CAnd more danger.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut Dalinar, you\u2019re having experiences scholars, historians, and folklorists could only dream about! I envy you, although you claim to have seen no fabrials of note.\u201D\r\n\u201CThe ancients didn\u2019t have fabrials, Navani. I\u2019m certain of it.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd that changes everything we thought we understood about them.\u201D\r\n\u201CI suppose.\u201D\r\n\u201CStonefalls, Dalinar,\u201D she said, sighing. \u201CDoes nothing bring you to passion any longer?\u201D\r\nDalinar took a deep breath. \u201CToo many things, Navani. My insides feel like a mass of eels, emotions squirming over one another. The truth of these visions is unsettling.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s exciting,\u201D she corrected. \u201CDid you mean what you said earlier? About trusting me?\u201D\r\n\u201CI said that?\u201D\r\n\u201CYou said you didn\u2019t trust your clerks, and you asked me to record the visions. There\u2019s an implication in that.\u201D\r\nHer hand was still on his arm. She reached out with her safehand and closed the door to the hallway. He almost stopped her, but he hesitated. Why?\r\nThe door clicked closed. They were alone. And she was so beautiful. Those clever, excitable eyes, alight with passion.\r\n\u201CNavani,\u201D Dalinar said, forcing down his desire. \u201CYou\u2019re doing it again.\u201D Why did he let her?\r\n\u201CYes, I am,\u201D she said. \u201CI\u2019m a stubborn woman, Dalinar.\u201D There didn\u2019t seem to be any playfulness in her tone.\r\n\u201CThis is not proper. My brother\u2026\u201D He reached for the door to open it again.\r\n\u201CYour brother,\u201D Navani spat, expression flashing with anger. \u201CWhy must everyone always focus on him? Everyone always worries so much about the man who died! He\u2019s not here, Dalinar. He\u2019s gone. I miss him. But not half as much as you do, it appears.\u201D\r\n\u201CI honor his memory,\u201D Dalinar said stiffly, hesitating, hand on the door\u2019s latch.\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s fine! I\u2019m happy you do. But it\u2019s been\r\nsix years, and all anyone can see me as is the wife of a dead man. The other women, they humor me with idle gossip, but they won\u2019t let me into their political circles. They think I\u2019m a relic. You wanted to know why I came back so quickly?\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CI\r\nreturned,\u201D she said, \u201Cbecause I have no home. I\u2019m expected to sit out of important events because my husband is dead! Lounge around, pampered but ignored. I make them uncomfortable. The queen, the other women at court.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m sorry,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CBut I don\u2019t\u2014\u201D\r\nShe raised her freehand, tapping him on the chest. \u201CI won\u2019t take it from you, Dalinar. We were friends before I even\r\nmetGavilar! You still know me as me, not some shadow of a dynasty that crumbled years ago. Don\u2019t you?\u201D She looked at him, pleading.\r\nBlood of my fathers,Dalinar thought with shock.\r\nShe\u2019s crying.Two small tears.\r\nHe had rarely seen her so sincere.\r\nAnd so he kissed her.\r\nIt was a mistake. He knew it was. He grabbed her anyway, pulling her into a rough, tight embrace and pressing his mouth to hers, unable to contain himself. She melted against him. He tasted the salt of her tears as they ran down to her lips and met his.\r\nIt lasted long. Too long. Wonderfully long. His mind screamed at him, like a prisoner chained in a cell and forced to watch something horrible. But a part of him had wanted this for decades\u2014decades spent watching his brother court, marry, and then hold the only woman that the young Dalinar had ever wanted.\r\nHe\u2019d told himself he would never allow this. He had denied himself feelings for Navani the moment Gavilar had won her hand. Dalinar had stepped aside.\r\nBut the taste of her\u2014the smell of her, the warmth of her pressed against him\u2014was too sweet. Like a blossoming perfume, it washed away the guilt. For a moment, that touch banished everything. He couldn\u2019t remember his fear at the visions, his worry about Sadeas, his shame at past mistakes.\r\nHe could only think of her. Beautiful, insightful, delicate yet strong at once. He clung to her, something he could hold onto as the rest of the world churned around him.\r\nEventually, he broke the kiss. She looked up at him, dazed. Passion-spren, like tiny flakes of crystalline snow, floated down in the air around them. Guilt flooded him again. He tried gently to push her away, but she clung to him, holding on tight.\r\n\u201CNavani,\u201D he said.\r\n\u201CHush.\u201D She pressed her head against his chest.\r\n\u201CWe can\u2019t\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CHush,\u201D she said, more insistently.\r\nHe sighed, but let himself hold her.\r\n\u201CSomething is going wrong in this world, Dalinar,\u201D Navani said softly. \u201CThe king of Jah Keved was assassinated. I heard it just today. He was killed by a Shin Shardbearer in white clothing.\u201D\r\n\u201CStormfather!\u201D Dalinar said.\r\n\u201CSomething\u2019s going on,\u201D she said. \u201CSomething bigger than our war here, something bigger than Gavilar. Have you heard of the twisted things men say when they die? Most ignore it, but surgeons are talking. And stormwardens whisper that the highstorms are growing more powerful.\u201D\r\n\u201CI have heard,\u201D he said, finding it difficult to get the words out, intoxicated by her as he was.\r\n\u201CMy daughter seeks something,\u201D Navani said. \u201CShe frightens me sometimes. She\u2019s so intense. I honestly believe she\u2019s the most intelligent person I\u2019ve ever known. And the things she searches for\u2026 Dalinar, she believes that something very dangerous is near.\u201D\r\nThe sun approaches the horizon. The Everstorm comes. The True Desolation. The Night of Sorrows\u2026.\r\n\u201CI need you,\u201D Navani said. \u201CI\u2019ve known it for years, though I feared it would destroy you with guilt, so I fled. But I couldn\u2019t stay away. Not with the way they treat me. Not with what is happening to the world. I\u2019m terrified, Dalinar, and I need you. Gavilar was not the man everyone thought him to be. I was fond of him, but he\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CPlease,\u201D Dalinar said, \u201Cdon\u2019t speak ill of him.\u201D\r\n\u201CVery well.\u201D\r\nBlood of my fathers!He couldn\u2019t get her scent out of his head. He felt paralyzed, holding to her like a man clinging to a stone in the stormwinds.\r\nShe looked up at him. \u201CWell, let it be said\u2014then\u2014that I was fond of Gavilar. But I\u2019m more than fond of you. And I\u2019m tired of waiting.\u201D\r\nHe closed his eyes. \u201CHow can this work?\u201D\r\n\u201CWe\u2019ll find a way.\u201D\r\n\u201CWe\u2019ll be denounced.\u201D\r\n\u201CThe warcamps already ignore me,\u201D Navani said, \u201Cand they spread rumors and lies about you. What more can they do to us?\u201D\r\n\u201CThey\u2019ll find something. As of yet, the devotaries do not condemn me.\u201D\r\n\u201CGavilar is dead,\u201D Navani said, resting her head back against his chest. \u201CI was never unfaithful while he lived, though the Stormfather knows I had ample reason. The devotaries can say what they wish, but\r\nThe Argumentsdo not forbid our union. Tradition is not the same as doctrine, and I will not hold myself back for fear of offending.\u201D\r\nDalinar took a deep breath, then forced himself to open his arms and pull back. \u201CIf you had hoped to soothe my worries for the day, then this didn\u2019t help.\u201D\r\nShe folded her arms. He could still feel where her safehand had touched him on the back. A tender touch, reserved for a family member. \u201CI\u2019m not here to soothe you, Dalinar. Quite the opposite.\u201D\r\n\u201CPlease. I\r\ndoneed time to think.\u201D\r\n\u201CI won\u2019t let you put me away. I won\u2019t ignore that this happened. I won\u2019t\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CNavani,\u201D he gently cut her off, \u201CI will not abandon you. I promise.\u201D\r\nShe eyed him, then a wry smile crept onto her face. \u201CVery well. But you began something today.\u201D\r\n\u201C\r\nIbegan it?\u201D he asked, amused, elated, confused, worried, and ashamed at the same time.\r\n\u201CThe kiss was yours, Dalinar,\u201D she said idly, pulling open the door and entering his antechamber.\r\n\u201CYou seduced me to it.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat? Seduced?\u201D She glanced back at him. \u201CDalinar, I\u2019ve never been more open and honest in my life.\u201D\r\n\u201CI know,\u201D Dalinar said, smiling. \u201CThat was the seductive part.\u201D He closed the door softly, then let out a sigh.\r\nBlood of my fathers,he thought,\r\nwhy can\u2019t these things ever be simple?\r\nAnd yet, in direct contrast with his thoughts, he felt as if the entire world had somehow become more right for having gone wrong."

      "ChapterName": "62: THREE GLYPHS",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\n\u201CThe darkness becomes a palace. Let it rule! Let it rule!\u201D\r\n\u2014Kakevah 1173, 22 seconds pre-death. A darkeyed Selay man of unknown profession.\r\n\u201CYou think one of those will save us?\u201D Moash asked, scowling as he looked at the prayer tied about Kaladin\u2019s upper right arm.\r\nKaladin glanced to the side. He stood at parade rest as Sadeas\u2019s soldiers crossed their bridge. The chilly spring air felt good, now that he\u2019d started working. The sky was bright, cloudless, and the stormwardens promised that no highstorm was near.\r\nThe prayer tied on his arms was simple. Three glyphs: wind, protection, beloved. A prayer to Jezerezeh\u2014the Stormfather\u2014to protect loved ones and friends. It was the straightforward type his mother had preferred. For all her subtlety and wryness, whenever she\u2019d knitted or written a prayer, it had been simple and heartfelt. Wearing it reminded him of her.\r\n\u201CI can\u2019t believe you paid good money for that,\u201D Moash said. \u201CIf there are Heralds watching, they don\u2019t pay any mind to bridgemen.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve been feeling nostalgic lately, I guess.\u201D The prayer was probably meaningless, but he\u2019d had reason to start thinking more about religion lately. The life of a slave made it difficult for many to believe that anyone, or anything, was watching. Yet many bridgemen had grown more religious during their captivity. Two groups, opposite reactions. Did that mean some were stupid and others were callous, or something else entirely?\r\n\u201CThey\u2019re going to see us dead, you know,\u201D Drehy said from behind. \u201CThis is it.\u201D The bridgemen were exhausted. Kaladin and his team had been forced to work the chasms all night. Hashal had put strict requirements on them, demanding an increased amount of salvage. In order to meet the quota, they\u2019d forgone training to scavenge.\r\nAnd then today they\u2019d been awakened for a morning chasm assault after only three hours of sleep. They were drooping as they stood in line, and they hadn\u2019t even reached the contested plateau yet.\r\n\u201CLet it come,\u201D Skar said quietly from the other side of the line. \u201CThey want us dead? Well, I\u2019m not going to back down. We\u2019ll show them what courage is. They can hide behind our bridges while we charge.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s no victory,\u201D Moash said. \u201CI say we attack the soldiers. Right now.\u201D\r\n\u201COur own troops?\u201D Sigzil said, turning his dark-skinned head and looking down the line of men.\r\n\u201CSure,\u201D Moash said, eyes still forward. \u201CThey\u2019re going to kill us anyway. Let\u2019s take a few of them with us. Damnation, why not charge Sadeas? His guard won\u2019t expect it. I\u2019ll bet we could knock down a few and grab their spears, then be on to killing lighteyes before they cut us down.\u201D\r\nA couple of bridgemen murmured their assent as the soldiers continued to cross.\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CIt wouldn\u2019t accomplish anything. They\u2019d have us dead before we could so much as inconvenience Sadeas.\u201D\r\nMoash spat. \u201CAnd this will accomplish something? Damnation, Kaladin, I feel like I\u2019m already dangling from the noose!\u201D\r\n\u201CI have a plan,\u201D Kaladin said.\r\nHe waited for the objections. His other plans hadn\u2019t worked.\r\nNo one offered a complaint.\r\n\u201CWell then,\u201D Moash said. \u201CWhat is it?\u201D\r\n\u201CYou\u2019ll see today,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CIf it works, it will buy us time. If it fails, I\u2019ll be dead.\u201D He turned to look down the line of faces. \u201CIn that case, Teft has orders to lead you on an escape attempt tonight. You\u2019re not ready, but at least you\u2019ll have a chance.\u201D That was far better than attacking Sadeas as he crossed.\r\nKaladin\u2019s men nodded, and Moash seemed content. As contrary as he\u2019d been originally, he had grown equally loyal. He was hotheaded, but he was also the best with the spear.\r\nSadeas approached, riding his roan stallion, wearing his red Shardplate, helm on but visor up. By chance, he crossed on Kaladin\u2019s bridge, though\u2014as always\u2014he had twenty to choose from. Sadeas didn\u2019t give Bridge Four so much as a glance.\r\n\u201CBreak and cross,\u201D Kaladin ordered after Sadeas was over. The bridgemen crossed their bridge, and Kaladin gave the orders for them to pull it behind them, then lift.\r\nIt felt heavier than it ever had before. The bridgemen broke into a trot, rounding the army column and hustling to reach the next chasm. In the distance behind, a second army\u2014one in blue\u2014was following them, crossing using some of Sadeas\u2019s other bridge crews. It looked like Dalinar Kholin had given up his bulky mechanical bridges, and was now using Sadeas\u2019s own bridge crews to cross. So much for his \u201Chonor\u201D and not sacrificing bridgeman lives.\r\nIn his pouch, Kaladin carried a large number of infused spheres, obtained from the moneychangers in exchange for a greater quantity of dun spheres. He hated taking that loss, but he needed the Stormlight.\r\nThey reached the next chasm quickly. It would be the next-to-last one, according to the word he\u2019d gotten from Matal, Hashal\u2019s husband. The soldiers began checking their armor, stretching, anticipationspren rising in the air like small streamers.\r\nThe bridgemen set their bridge and stepped back. Kaladin noted Lopen and silent Dabbid approaching with their stretcher, waterskins and bandages inside. Lopen had hitched the stretcher to a hook at his waist, making up for his missing arm. The two moved among the members of Bridge Four, giving them water.\r\nAs he passed Kaladin, Lopen nodded toward the large bulge at the stretcher\u2019s center. The armor. \u201CWhen do you want it?\u201D Lopen asked softly, lowering the litter, then handing Kaladin a waterskin.\r\n\u201CRight before we run the assault,\u201D Kaladin replied. \u201CYou did well, Lopen.\u201D\r\nLopen winked. \u201CA one-armed Herdazian is still twice as useful as a no-brained Alethi. Plus, so long as I\u2019ve got one hand, I can still do this.\u201D He covertly made a rude gesture toward the marching soldiers.\r\nKaladin smiled, but was growing too nervous to feel mirth. It had been a long time since he\u2019d gotten jitters going into a battle. He thought Tukks had beaten that out of him years ago.\r\n\u201CHey,\u201D a sudden voice called, \u201CI need some of that.\u201D\r\nKaladin spun to see a soldier walking over. He was exactly the type of man Kaladin had known to avoid back in Amaram\u2019s army. Darkeyed but of modest rank, he was naturally large, and had probably gotten promoted by sheer virtue of size. His armor was well maintained but the uniform beneath was stained and wrinkled, and he kept the sleeves rolled up, exposing hairy arms.\r\nAt first, Kaladin assumed that the man had seen Lopen\u2019s gesture. But the man didn\u2019t seem mad. He shoved Kaladin aside, then pulled the waterskin away from Lopen. Nearby, the soldiers waiting to cross had noticed. Their own water crews were much slower, and more than a few of the waiting men eyed Lopen and his waterskins.\r\nIt would set a terrible precedent to let the soldiers take their water\u2014but that was a tiny problem compared with the greater one. If those soldiers swarmed around the litter to get water, they\u2019d discover the sack full of armor.\r\nKaladin moved quickly, snatching the waterskin from the soldier\u2019s hand. \u201CYou have your own water crews.\u201D\r\nThe soldier looked at Kaladin, as if completely unable to believe that a bridgeman was standing up to him. He scowled darkly, lowering his spear to his side, its butt against the ground. \u201CI don\u2019t want to wait.\u201D\r\n\u201CHow unfortunate,\u201D Kaladin said, stepping right up to the man, meeting him eye to eye. Silently, he cursed the idiot. If it turned into a scuffle\u2026\r\nThe soldier hesitated, even more astonished to see such an aggressive threat from a bridgeman. Kaladin wasn\u2019t as thick-armed as this man, but he was a finger or two taller. The soldier\u2019s uncertainty showed in his face.\r\nJust back down,Kaladin thought.\r\nBut no. Backing down from a bridgeman while his squad was watching? The man made a fist, knuckles cracking.\r\nWithin seconds, the entire bridge crew was there. The soldier blinked as Bridge Four formed around Kaladin in an aggressive inverted wedge pattern, moving naturally\u2014smoothly\u2014as Kaladin had trained them. Each one made fists, giving the soldier ample chance to see that the heavy lifting had trained these men to a physical level beyond that of the average soldier.\r\nThe man glanced back at his squad, as if looking for support.\r\n\u201CDo you want to spark a fight now, friend?\u201D Kaladin asked softly. \u201CIf you hurt the bridgemen, I wonder who Sadeas will make run this bridge.\u201D\r\nThe man glanced back at Kaladin, was silent for a moment, then scowled, cursed, and stalked away. \u201CProbably full of crem anyway,\u201D he muttered, rejoining his team.\r\nThe members of Bridge Four relaxed, though they received more than a few appreciative looks from the other soldiers in line. For once, there was something other than scowls. Hopefully they wouldn\u2019t realize that a squad of bridgemen had quickly and accurately made a battle formation commonly used in spear fighting.\r\nKaladin waved for his men to stand down, nodding his thanks. They fell back, and Kaladin tossed the recovered waterskin back to Lopen.\r\nThe shorter man smirked wryly. \u201CI\u2019ll keep a tighter grip on these things from now on, gancho.\u201D He eyed the soldier who had tried to take the water.\r\n\u201CWhat?\u201D Kaladin asked.\r\n\u201CWell, I\u2019ve got a cousin in the water crews, you see,\u201D Lopen said. \u201CAnd I\u2019m thinking that he might owe me a favor on account of this one time I helped his sister\u2019s friend escape a guy looking for her\u2026.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou\r\ndohave a lot of cousins.\u201D\r\n\u201CNever enough. You bother one of us, you bother us all. That\u2019s something you strawheads never seem to get. No offense or anything, gancho.\u201D\r\nKaladin raised an eyebrow. \u201CDon\u2019t make trouble for the soldier. Not today.\u201D\r\nI\u2019ll make enough of that myself here soon.\r\nLopen sighed, but nodded. \u201CAll right. For you.\u201D He held up a waterskin. \u201CYou sure you don\u2019t want any?\u201D\r\nKaladin didn\u2019t; his stomach was too unsettled. But he made himself take the waterskin back and drink a few mouthfuls.\r\nBefore long, the time came to cross and pull the bridge up for the last run. The assault. Sadeas\u2019s soldiers were forming ranks, lighteyes riding back and forth, calling orders. Matal waved Kaladin\u2019s crew forward. Dalinar Kholin\u2019s army had fallen behind, coming more slowly because of his larger numbers.\r\nKaladin took his place at the very front of his bridge. Ahead, the Parshendi were lined up with bows on the edge of their plateau, staring down the oncoming assault. Were they singing already? Kaladin thought he could hear their voices.\r\nMoash was on Kaladin\u2019s right, Rock on his left. Only three on the deathline, because of how shorthanded they were. He\u2019d put Shen in the very back, so he wouldn\u2019t see what Kaladin was about to do.\r\n\u201CI\u2019m going to duck out from underneath once we start moving,\u201D Kaladin told them. \u201CRock, you take over. Keep them running.\u201D\r\n\u201CVery well,\u201D Rock said. \u201CIt will be hard to carry without you. We have so few men, and we are very weak.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou\u2019ll manage. You\u2019ll have to.\u201D\r\nKaladin couldn\u2019t see Rock\u2019s face, not positioned under the bridge as they were, but his voice sounded troubled. \u201CThis thing you will try, is dangerous?\u201D\r\n\u201CPerhaps.\u201D\r\n\u201CCan I help?\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m afraid not, my friend. But it strengthens me to hear you ask.\u201D\r\nRock didn\u2019t get a chance to reply. Matal yelled for the bridge crews to go. Arrows shot overhead to distract the Parshendi. Bridge Four broke into a run.\r\nAnd Kaladin ducked down and dashed out in front of them. Lopen was waiting to the side, and he tossed Kaladin the sack of armor.\r\nMatal screamed at Kaladin in a panic, but the bridge crews were already in motion. Kaladin focused on his goal, protecting Bridge Four, and sucked in sharply. Stormlight flooded him from the pouch at his waist, but he didn\u2019t draw too much. Just enough to give him a jolt of energy.\r\nSyl zipped in front of him, a ripple in the air, nearly invisible. Kaladin whipped the tie off the sack, pulling out the vest and throwing it awkwardly over his head. He ignored the ties at the side, getting on the helm as he leaped over a small rock formation. The shield came last, clattering with red Parshendi bones in a crisscross pattern on the front.\r\nEven while donning the armor, Kaladin easily stayed far ahead of the heavily laden bridge crews. His Stormlight-infused legs were quick and sure.\r\nThe Parshendi archers directly ahead of him abruptly stopped singing. Several of them lowered their bows, and though it was too distant to make out their faces, he could sense their outrage. Kaladin had expected this. He\u2019d hoped for it.\r\nThe Parshendi left their dead. Not because they were uncaring, but because they found it a terrible offense to move them. Merely touching the dead seemed a sin. If that was the case, a man desecrating corpses and wearing them into battle would be far, far worse.\r\nAs Kaladin grew closer, a different song started among the Parshendi archers. A quick, violent song, more chant than melody. Those who had lowered their bows raised them.\r\nAnd they tried with everything they had to kill him.\r\nArrows flew at him. Dozens of them. They weren\u2019t fired in careful waves. They flew individually, rapidly, wildly, each archer loosing at Kaladin as quickly as he could. A swarm of death bore down on him.\r\nPulse racing, Kaladin ducked to the left, leaping off a small outcropping. Arrows sliced the air around him, dangerously close. But while infused with the Stormlight, his muscles reacted quickly. He dodged between arrows, then turned in the other direction, moving erratically.\r\nBehind, Bridge Four came into range, and not a single arrow was fired at them. Other bridge crews were ignored as well, many of the archers focusing on Kaladin. The arrows came more swiftly, spraying around him, bouncing off his shield. One sliced open his arm as it shot past; another snapped against his helm, nearly knocking it free.\r\nThe arm wound leaked Light, not blood, and to Kaladin\u2019s amazement it slowly began to seal up, frost crystallizing on his skin and Stormlight draining from him. He drew in more, infusing himself to the cusp of glowing visibly. He ducked, he dodged, he jumped, he ran.\r\nHis battle-trained reflexes delighted in the newfound speed, and he used the shield to knock arrows out of the air. It was as if his body had longed for this ability, as if it had been born to take advantage of the Stormlight. During the earlier part of his life, he had lived sluggish and impotent. Now he was healed. Not acting beyond his capacities\u2014no, finally\r\nreachingthem.\r\nA flock of arrows sought his blood, but Kaladin spun between them, taking another slice on the arm but deflecting the others with shield or breastplate. The flight came, and he brought his shield up, worried that he\u00A0was going to be too slow. However, the arrows changed course, arcing toward his shield, slamming into it. Drawn to it.\r\nI\u2019m pulling them to it!He remembered dozens of bridge runs, with arrows slamming into the wood near where his hands had clung to the support bars. Always just missing him.\r\nHow long have I been doing this?Kaladin thought.\r\nHow many arrows did I draw to the bridge, pulling them away from me?\r\nHe didn\u2019t have time to think about that. He kept moving, dodging. He felt arrows whish through the air, heard them zip, felt the splinters as they hit stone or shield and broke. He\u2019d hoped that he would distract some of the Parshendi from firing on his men, but he\u2019d had no idea how strong a reaction he\u2019d get.\r\nPart of him exulted in the thrill of ducking, dodging, and blocking the hail of arrows. He started to slow, however. He tried to suck in Stormlight, but none came. His spheres were drained. He panicked, still dodging, but then the arrowfalls began to slacken.\r\nWith a start, Kaladin realized that the bridge crews had parted around him, leaving a space for him to keep dodging while they passed him and set their burdens. Bridge Four was in place, cavalry charging across to attack the archers. Despite that, some of the Parshendi continued to fire on Kaladin, enraged. The soldiers cut these Parshendi down easily, sweeping the ground of them and making room for Sadeas\u2019s foot soldiers.\r\nKaladin lowered his shield. It bristled with arrows. He barely had time to take a fresh breath of air as the bridgemen reached him, calling out with joy, nearly tackling him in their excitement.\r\n\u201CYou fool!\u201D Moash said. \u201CYou storming fool! What was that? What were you thinking?\u201D\r\n\u201CWas incredible,\u201D Rock said.\r\n\u201CYou should be dead!\u201D Sigzil said, though his normally stern face was split by a smile.\r\n\u201CStormfather,\u201D Moash added, pulling an arrow from Kaladin\u2019s vest at the shoulder. \u201CLook at these.\u201D\r\nKaladin looked down, shocked to find a dozen arrow holes in the sides of his vest and shirt where he\u2019d narrowly avoided being hit. Three arrows stuck from the leather.\r\n\u201CStormblessed,\u201D Skar said. \u201CThat\u2019s all there is too it.\u201D\r\nKaladin shrugged off their praise, his heart still pounding. He was numb. Amazed that he\u2019d survived, cold from the Stormlight he\u2019d consumed, exhausted as if he\u2019d run a rigorous obstacle course. He looked to Teft, raising an eyebrow, nodding toward the pouch at his waist.\r\nTeft shook his head. He\u2019d watched; the Stormlight rising from Kaladin hadn\u2019t been visible to those observing, not in the light of day. Still, the way Kaladin had dodged would have looked incredible, even without the obvious light. If there had been stories about him before, they would grow greatly following this.\r\nHe turned to look at the passing troops. As he did, he realized something. He still had to deal with Matal. \u201CFall into line, men,\u201D he said.\r\nThey obeyed reluctantly, falling into place around him in a double rank. Ahead, Matal stood beside their bridge. He looked concerned, as well he should. Sadeas was riding up. Kaladin steeled himself, remembering how his previous victory\u2014when they\u2019d run with the bridge on its side\u2014had been turned on its head. He hesitated, then hurried over toward the bridge where Sadeas was going to ride past Matal. Kaladin\u2019s men followed.\r\nKaladin arrived as Matal bowed to Sadeas, who wore his glorious red Shardplate. Kaladin and the bridgemen bowed as well.\r\n\u201CAvarak Matal,\u201D Sadeas said. He nodded toward Kaladin. \u201CThis man looks familiar.\u201D\r\n\u201CHe is the one from before, Brightlord,\u201D Matal said, nervous. \u201CThe one who\u2026\u201D\r\n\u201CAh yes,\u201D Sadeas said. \u201CThe \u2018miracle.\u2019 And you sent him forward as a decoy like that? One would think that you would be hesitant to dare such measures.\u201D\r\n\u201CI take full responsibility, Brightlord,\u201D Matal said, putting the best face on it.\r\nSadeas regarded the battlefield. \u201CWell, luckily for you, it worked. I suppose I\u2019ll have to promote you now.\u201D He shook his head. \u201CThose savages practically ignored the assault force. All twenty bridges set, most with nary a casualty. It seems like a waste, somehow. Consider yourself commended. Most remarkable, the way that boy dodged\u2026\u201D He kicked his horse into motion, leaving Matal and the bridgemen behind.\r\nIt was the most backhanded promotion Kaladin had ever heard, but that would do. Kaladin smiled broadly as Matal turned to him, eyes enraged.\r\n\u201CYou\u2014\u201D Matal sputtered. \u201CYou could have gotten me executed!\u201D\r\n\u201CInstead I got you promoted,\u201D Kaladin said, Bridge Four forming around him.\r\n\u201CI should see you strung up anyway.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s been tried,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CDidn\u2019t work. Besides, you know that from now on Sadeas is going to expect me to be out there distracting the archers. Good luck getting any other bridgeman to try that.\u201D\r\nMatal\u2019s face grew red. He turned and stalked away to check on the other bridge crews. The two nearest\u2014Bridge Seven and Bridge Eighteen\u2014stood looking toward Kaladin and his team. All twenty bridges had been set? Hardly any casualties?\r\nStormfather,Kaladin thought.\r\nHow many archers were firing at me?\r\n\u201CYou did it, Kaladin!\u201D Moash exclaimed. \u201CYou found the secret. We need to make this work. Expand it.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll bet I could dodge those arrows, if that were all I was doing,\u201D Skar said. \u201CWith enough armor\u2026\u201D\r\n\u201CWe should have more than one,\u201D Moash agreed. \u201CFive or so, running around drawing the Parshendi attacks.\u201D\r\n\u201CThe bones,\u201D Rock said, folding his arms. \u201CThis is what made it work. The Parshendi were so mad that they ignored bridge crew. If all five wear the bones of Parshendi\u2026\u201D\r\nThat made Kaladin consider something. He looked back, searching through the bridgemen. Where was Shen?\r\nThere. He was sitting on the rocks, distant, staring forward. Kaladin approached with the others. The parshman looked up at him, face a mask of pain, tears streaking his cheeks. He looked at Kaladin and shuddered visibly, turning away, closing his eyes.\r\n\u201CHe sat down like that the moment he saw what you\u2019d done, lad,\u201D Teft said, rubbing his chin. \u201CMight not be good for bridge runs anymore.\u201D\r\nKaladin pulled the carapace-tied helm off his head, then ran his fingers through his hair. The carapace stuck to his clothing stank faintly, even though he\u2019d washed it off down below. \u201CWe\u2019ll see,\u201D Kaladin said, feeling a twist of guilt. Not nearly enough to overshadow the victory of protecting his men, but enough to dampen it, at least. \u201CFor now, there are still many bridge crews that got fired upon. You know what to do.\u201D\r\nThe men nodded, trotting off to search for the wounded. Kaladin set one man to watch over Shen\u2014he wasn\u2019t sure what else to do with the parshman\u2014and tried not to show his exhaustion as he put his sweaty, carapace-covered cap and vest in Lopen\u2019s litter. He knelt down to go through his medical equipment, in case it was needed, and found that his hand was shaking and quivering. He pressed it down against the ground to still it, breathing in and out.\r\nCold, clammy skin,he thought.\r\nNausea. Weakness.He was in shock.\r\n\u201CYou all right, lad?\u201D Teft asked, kneeling down beside Kaladin. He still wore a bandage on his arm from the wound he\u2019d taken a few bridge runs back, but it wasn\u2019t enough to stop him from carrying. Not when there were too few as it was.\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll be fine,\u201D Kaladin said, taking out a waterskin, holding it in a quivering hand. He could barely get the top off.\r\n\u201CYou don\u2019t look\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll be fine,\u201D Kaladin said again, drinking, then lowering the water. \u201CWhat\u2019s important is that the men are safe.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou going to do this every time. Whenever we go to battle?\u201D\r\n\u201CWhatever keeps them safe.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou\u2019re not immortal, Kaladin,\u201D Teft said softly. \u201CThe Radiants, they could be killed, just like any man. Sooner or later, one of those arrows will find your neck instead of your shoulder.\u201D\r\n\u201CThe Stormlight heals.\u201D\r\n\u201CThe Stormlight helps your body heal. That\u2019s different, I\u2019m thinking.\u201D Teft laid a hand on Kaladin\u2019s shoulder. \u201CWe can\u2019t lose you, lad. The men need you.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m not going to avoid putting myself in danger, Teft. And I\u2019m not going to leave the men to face a storm of arrows if I can do something about it.\u201D\r\n\u201CWell,\u201D Teft said, \u201Cyou are going to let a few of us go out there with you. The bridge can manage with twenty-five, if it has to. That leaves us a few extra, just like Rock said. And I\u2019ll bet some of those wounded from the other crews we saved are well enough to begin helping carry. They won\u2019t dare send them back to their own crews, not so long as Bridge Four is doing what you did today, and helping the whole assault work.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2026\u201D Kaladin trailed off. He could imagine Dallet doing something like this. He\u2019d always said that as sergeant, part of his job was to keep Kaladin alive. \u201CAll right.\u201D\r\nTeft nodded, rising.\r\n\u201CYou were a spearman, Teft,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CDon\u2019t try to deny it. How did you end up here, in these bridge crews?\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s where I belong.\u201D Teft turned away to supervise the search for wounded.\r\nKaladin sat down, then lay back, waiting for the shock to wear off. To the south, the other army\u2014flying the blue of Dalinar Kholin\u2014had arrived. They crossed to an adjacent plateau.\r\nKaladin closed his eyes to recover. Eventually, he heard something and opened his eyes. Syl sat cross-legged on his chest. Behind her, Dalinar Kholin\u2019s army had begun an assault onto the battlefield, and they managed to do so without getting fired on. Sadeas had the Parshendi cut off.\r\n\u201CThat was amazing,\u201D Kaladin said to Syl. \u201CWhat I did with the arrows.\u201D\r\n\u201CStill think you\u2019re cursed?\u201D\r\n\u201CNo. I know I\u2019m not.\u201D He looked up at the overcast sky. \u201CBut that means the failures were all just me. I let Tien die, I failed my spearmen, the slaves I tried to rescue, Tarah\u2026\u201D He hadn\u2019t thought of her in some time. His failure with her had been different from the others, but a failure it was nonetheless. \u201CIf there\u2019s no curse or bad luck, no god above being angry at me\u2014I have to live with knowing that with a little more effort\u2014a little more practice or skill\u2014I could have saved them.\u201D\r\nSyl frowned more deeply. \u201CKaladin, you need to get over this. Those things aren\u2019t your fault.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s what my father always used to say.\u201D He smiled faintly. \u201C\u2018Overcome your guilt, Kaladin. Care, but not too much. Take responsibility, but don\u2019t blame yourself.\u2019 Protect, save, help\u2014but know when to give up. They\u2019re such precarious ledges to walk. How do I do it?\u201D\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know any of this, Kaladin. But you\u2019re ripping yourself apart. Inside and out.\u201D\r\nKaladin stared at the sky above. \u201CIt was wondrous. I was a storm, Syl. The Parshendi couldn\u2019t touch me. The arrows were nothing.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou\u2019re too new to this. You pushed yourself too hard.\u201D\r\n\u201C\u2018Save them,\u2019\u201D Kaladin whispered. \u201C\u2018Do the impossible, Kaladin. But don\u2019t push yourself too hard. But also don\u2019t feel guilty if you fail.\u2019 Precarious ledges, Syl. So narrow\u2026\u201D\r\nSome of his men returned with a wounded man, a square-faced Thaylen fellow with an arrow in the shoulder. Kaladin went to work. His hands were still shaking slightly, but not nearly as badly as they had been.\r\nThe bridgemen clustered around, watching. He\u2019d started training Rock, Drehy, and Skar already, but with all of them watching, Kaladin found himself explaining. \u201CIf you put pressure here, you can slow the blood flow. This isn\u2019t too dangerous a wound, though it probably doesn\u2019t feel too good\u2026\u201D\u2014the patient grimaced his agreement\u2014\u201C\u2026and the real problem will come from infection. Wash the wound to make sure there aren\u2019t any slivers of wood or bits of metal left, then sew it. The muscles and skin of the shoulder here are going to get worked, so you need a strong thread to hold the wound together. Now\u2026\u201D\r\n\u201CKaladin,\u201D Lopen said, sounding worried.\r\n\u201CWha?\u201D Kaladin said, distracted, still working.\r\n\u201CKaladin!\u201D\r\nLopen had called him by his name, rather than saying\r\ngancho. Kaladin stood up, turning to see the short Herdazian man standing at the back of the crowd, pointing at the chasm. The battle had moved farther north, but a group of Parshendi had punched through Sadeas\u2019s line. They had bows.\r\nKaladin watched, stunned, as the group of Parshendi fell into formation and nocked. Fifty arrows, all pointed at Kaladin\u2019s crew. The Parshendi didn\u2019t seem to care that they were exposing themselves to attack from behind. They seemed focused on only one thing.\r\nDestroying Kaladin and his men.\r\nKaladin screamed the alarm, but he felt so sluggish, so tired. The bridgemen around him turned as the archers drew. Sadeas\u2019s men normally defended the chasm to keep Parshendi from pushing over the bridges and cutting off their escape. But this time, noticing that the archers weren\u2019t trying to drop the bridges, the soldiers didn\u2019t hasten to stop them. They left the bridgemen to die, instead cutting off the Parshendi route to the bridges themselves.\r\nKaladin\u2019s men were exposed. Perfect targets.\r\nNo,Kaladin thought.\r\nNo! It can\u2019t happen like this. Not after\u2014\r\nA force crashed into the Parshendi line. A single figure in slate-grey armor, wielding a sword as long as many men were tall. The Shardbearer swept through the distracted archers with urgency, slicing into their ranks. Arrows flew toward Kaladin\u2019s team, but they were loosed too early, aimed poorly. A few came close as the bridgemen ducked for cover, but nobody was hit.\r\nParshendi fell before the sweeping Blade of the Shardbearer, some toppling into the chasm, others scrambling back. The rest died with burned-out eyes. In seconds, the squad of fifty archers had been reduced to corpses.\r\nThe Shardbearer\u2019s honor guard caught up with him. He turned, armor seeming to glow as he raised his Blade in a salute of respect toward the bridgemen. Then he charged off in another direction.\r\n\u201CThat was him,\u201D Drehy said, standing up. \u201CDalinar Kholin. The king\u2019s uncle!\u201D\r\n\u201CHe saved us!\u201D Lopen said.\r\n\u201CBah.\u201D Moash dusted himself off. \u201CHe just saw a group of undefended archers and took the chance to strike. Lighteyes don\u2019t care about us. Right, Kaladin?\u201D\r\nKaladin stared at the place where the archers had stood. In one moment, he could have lost it all.\r\n\u201CKaladin?\u201D Moash said.\r\n\u201CYou\u2019re right,\u201D Kaladin found himself saying. \u201CJust an opportunity taken.\u201D\r\nExcept, why raise the Blade toward Kaladin?\r\n\u201CFrom now on,\u201D Kaladin said, \u201Cwe pull back farther after the soldiers cross. They used to ignore us after the battle began, but they won\u2019t any longer. What I did today\u2014what we\u2019re all going to be doing soon\u2014will make them mighty angry. Angry enough to be stupid, but also angry enough to see us dead. For now, Leyten, Narm, find good scouting points and watch the field. I want to know if any Parshendi make moves toward that chasm. I\u2019ll get this man bandaged and we\u2019ll pull back.\u201D\r\nThe two scouts ran off, and Kaladin turned back to the man with the wounded shoulder.\r\nMoash knelt beside him. \u201CAn assault against a prepared foe without any bridges lost, a Shardbearer coincidentally coming to our rescue, Sadeas himself complimenting us. You almost make me think I should get one of those armbands.\u201D\r\nKaladin glanced down at the prayer. It was stained with blood from a slice on his arm that the vanishing Stormlight hadn\u2019t quite been able to heal.\r\n\u201CWait to see if we escape.\u201D Kaladin finished his stitching. \u201CThat\u2019s the real test.\u201D"

      "ChapterName": "63: FEAR",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\n\u201CI wish to sleep. I know now why you do what you do, and I hate you for it. I will not speak of the truths I see.\u201D\r\n\u2014Kakashah 1173, 142 seconds pre-death. A Shin sailor, left behind by his crew, reportedly for bringing them ill luck. Sample largely useless.\r\n\u201CYou see?\u201D Leyten turned the piece of carapace over in his hands. \u201CIf we carve it up at the edge, it encourages a blade\u2014or in this case an arrow\u2014to deflect away from the face. Wouldn\u2019t want to spoil that pretty grin of yours.\u201D\r\nKaladin smiled, taking back the piece of armor. Leyten had carved it expertly, putting in holes for leather straps to affix it to the jerkin. The chasm was cold and dark at night. With the sky hidden, it felt like a cavern. Only the occasional sparkle of a star high above revealed otherwise.\r\n\u201CHow soon can you have them done?\u201D he asked Leyten.\r\n\u201CAll five? By the end of the night, likely. The real trick was discovering how to work it.\u201D He knocked on the carapace with the back of his knuckles. \u201CAmazing stuff. Nearly as hard as steel, but half the weight. Hard to cut or break. But if you drill, it shapes easily.\u201D\r\n\u201CGood,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CBecause I don\u2019t want five sets. I want one for each man in the crew.\u201D\r\nLeyten raised an eyebrow.\r\n\u201CIf they\u2019re going to start letting us wear armor,\u201D Kaladin said, \u201Ceveryone gets a suit. Except Shen, of course.\u201D Matal had agreed to let them leave him behind on the bridge runs; he wouldn\u2019t even look at Kaladin now.\r\nLeyten nodded. \u201CAll right, then. Better get me some help, though.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou can use the wounded men. We\u2019ll cart out as much carapace as we can find.\u201D\r\nHis success had translated to an easier time for Bridge Four. Kaladin had pled that his men needed time to find carapace, and Hashal\u2014not knowing any better\u2014had reduced the scavenging quota. She was already pretending\u2014quite smoothly\u2014that the armor had been her idea the entire time, and was ignoring the question of where it had come from in the first place. When she met Kaladin\u2019s eyes, however, he saw worry. What else would he try? So far, she hadn\u2019t dared remove him. Not while he brought her so much praise from Sadeas.\r\n\u201CHow did an apprentice armorer end up as a bridgeman anyway?\u201D Kaladin asked as Leyten settled back down to work. He was a thick-armed man, stout and oval-faced with light hair. \u201CCraftsmen don\u2019t usually get thrown away.\u201D\r\nLeyten shrugged. \u201CWhen a piece of armor breaks and a lighteyes takes an arrow in the shoulder, someone has to take the blame. I\u2019m convinced my master keeps an extra apprentice especially for those kinds of situation.\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, his loss is our good fortune. You\u2019re going to keep us alive.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll do my best, sir.\u201D He smiled. \u201CCan\u2019t do much worse on the armor than you did yourself, though. It\u2019s amazing that breastplate didn\u2019t fall off halfway through!\u201D\r\nKaladin patted the bridgeman on the shoulder, then left him to his work, surrounded by a small ring of topaz chips; Kaladin had gotten permission to bring them, explaining his men needed light to work on the armor. Nearby, Lopen, Rock, and Dabbid were returning with another load of salvage. Syl zipped ahead, leading them.\r\nKaladin walked down the chasm, a garnet sphere looped in a small leather carrier at his belt for light. The chasm branched here, making a large triangular intersection\u2014a perfect place for spear training. Wide enough to give the men room to practice, yet far enough from any permanent bridges that scouts weren\u2019t likely to hear echoes.\r\nKaladin gave the initial instructions each day, then let Teft lead the practice. The men worked by sphere light, small piles of diamond chips at the corners of the intersection, barely enough to see by.\r\nNever thought I\u2019d envy those days practicing beneath the hot sun back in Amaram\u2019s army,he thought.\r\nHe walked up to gap-toothed Hobber and corrected his stance, then showed him how to set his weight behind his spear thrusts. The bridgemen were progressing quickly, and the fundamentals were proving their merit. Some were training with the spear and the shield, practicing stances where they held lighter spears up beside the head with the shield raised.\r\nThe most skilled were Skar and Moash. In fact, Moash was surprisingly good. Kaladin walked to the side, watching the hawk-faced man. He was focused, eyes intense, jaw set. He moved in attack after attack, the dozen spheres giving him an equal number of shadows.\r\nKaladin remembered feeling such dedication. He\u2019d spent a year like that, after Tien\u2019s death, driving himself to exhaustion each day. Determined to get better. Determined never to let another person die because of his lack of skill. He\u2019d become the best in his squad, then the best in his company. Some said he\u2019d been the best spearmen in Amaram\u2019s army.\r\nWhat would have happened to him, if Tarah hadn\u2019t coaxed him out of his single-minded dedication? Would he have burned himself out, as she\u2019d claimed?\r\n\u201CMoash,\u201D Kaladin called.\r\nMoash paused, turning toward Kaladin. He didn\u2019t fall out of stance.\r\nKaladin waved him to approach, and Moash reluctantly trotted over. Lopen had left a few waterskins for them, hanging by their cords from a cluster of haspers. Kaladin pulled a skin free, tossing it to Moash. The other man took a drink, then wiped his mouth.\r\n\u201CYou\u2019re getting good,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CYou\u2019re probably the best we have.\u201D\r\n\u201CThanks,\u201D Moash said.\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve noticed you keep training when Teft lets the other men take breaks. Dedication is good, but don\u2019t work yourself ragged. I want you to be one of the decoys.\u201D\r\nMoash smiled broadly. Each of the men had volunteered to be one of the four who would join Kaladin distracting the Parshendi. It was amazing. Months ago, Moash\u2014along with the others\u2014had eagerly placed the new or the weak at the front of the bridge to catch arrows. Now, to a man, they volunteered for the most dangerous jobs.\r\nDo you realize what you could have in these men, Sadeas?Kaladin thought.\r\nIf you weren\u2019t so busy thinking of how to get them killed?\r\n\u201CSo what is it for you?\u201D Kaladin said, nodding toward the dim practice ground. \u201CWhy do you work so hard? What is it you hunt?\u201D\r\n\u201CVengeance,\u201D the other man said, face somber.\r\nKaladin nodded. \u201CI lost someone once. Because I wasn\u2019t good enough with the spear. I nearly killed myself practicing.\u201D\r\n\u201CWho was it?\u201D\r\n\u201CMy brother.\u201D\r\nMoash nodded. The other bridgemen, Moash included, seemed to regard Kaladin\u2019s \u201Cmysterious\u201D past with reverence.\r\n\u201CI\u2019m glad I trained,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CAnd I\u2019m glad you\u2019re dedicated. But you have to be careful. If I\u2019d gotten myself killed by working so hard, it wouldn\u2019t have meant anything.\u201D\r\n\u201CSure. But there\u2019s a difference between us, Kaladin.\u201D\r\nKaladin raised an eyebrow.\r\n\u201CYou wanted to be able to save someone. Me, I want to kill somebody.\u201D\r\n\u201CWho?\u201D\r\nMoash hesitated, then shook his head. \u201CMaybe I\u2019ll say, someday.\u201D He reached out, grabbing Kaladin on the shoulder. \u201CI\u2019d surrendered my plans, but you\u2019ve returned them to me. I\u2019ll guard you with my life, Kaladin. I swear it to you, by the blood of my fathers.\u201D\r\nKaladin met Moash\u2019s intense eyes and nodded. \u201CAll right, then. Go help Hobber and Yake. They\u2019re still off on their thrusts.\u201D\r\nMoash jogged off to do as told. He didn\u2019t call Kaladin \u201Csir,\u201D and didn\u2019t seem to regard him with the same unspoken reverence as the others. That made Kaladin more comfortable with him.\r\nKaladin spent the next hour helping the men, one by one. Most of them were overeager, throwing themselves into their attacks. Kaladin explained the importance of control and precision, which won more fights than chaotic enthusiasm. They took it in, listening. More and more, they reminded him of his old spear squad.\r\nThat set him thinking. He remembered how he had felt when originally proposing the escape plan to the men. He\u2019d been looking for something to do\u2014a way to fight, no matter how risky. A chance. Things had changed. He now had a team he was proud of, friends he had come to love, and a possibility\u2014perhaps\u2014for stability.\r\nIf they could get the dodging and armor right, they might be reasonably safe. Maybe even as safe as his old spear squad had been. Was running still the best option?\r\n\u201CThat is a worried face,\u201D a rumbling voice noted. Kaladin turned as Rock walked up and leaned against the wall near him, folding powerful forearms. \u201CIs the face of a leader, say I. Always troubled.\u201D Rock raised a bushy red eyebrow.\r\n\u201CSadeas will never let us go, particularly not now that we\u2019re so prominent.\u201D Alethi lighteyes considered it reprehensible for a man to let slaves escape; it made him seem impotent. Capturing those who ran away was essential to save face.\r\n\u201CYou said this thing before,\u201D Rock said. \u201CWe will fight the men he sends after us, will seek Kharbranth, where there are no slaves. From there, the Peaks, to my people who will welcome us as heroes!\u201D\r\n\u201CWe might beat the first group, if he\u2019s foolish and sends only a few dozen men. But after that he\u2019ll send more. And what of our wounded? Do we leave them here to die? Or do we take them with us and go that much more slowly?\u201D\r\nRock nodded slowly. \u201CYou are saying that we need a plan.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CI guess that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. Either that, or we stay here\u2026 as bridgemen.\u201D\r\n\u201CHa!\u201D Rock seemed to take it as a joke. \u201CDespite new armor, we would die soon. We make ourselves targets!\u201D\r\nKaladin hesitated. Rock was right. The bridgemen would be used, day in and day out. Even if Kaladin slowed the death toll to two or three men a month\u2014once, he would have considered that impossible, but now it seemed within reach\u2014Bridge Four as it was currently composed would be gone within a year.\r\n\u201CI will talk with Sigzil about this thing,\u201D Rock said, rubbing his chin between the sides of his beard. \u201CWe will think. There must be a way to escape this trap, a way to disappear. A false trail? A distraction? Perhaps we can convince Sadeas that we have died during bridge run.\u201D\r\n\u201CHow would we do that?\u201D\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t know,\u201D Rock said. \u201CBut we will think.\u201D He nodded to Kaladin and sauntered off toward Sigzil. The Azish man was practicing with the others. Kaladin had tried speaking to him about Hoid, but Sigzil\u2014typically closemouthed\u2014hadn\u2019t wanted to discuss it.\r\n\u201CHey, Kaladin!\u201D Skar called. He was part of an advanced group that was going through Teft\u2019s very carefully supervised sparring. \u201CCome spar with us. Show these rock-brained fools how it\u2019s really done.\u201D The others began calling for him as well.\r\nKaladin waved them down, shaking his head.\r\nTeft trotted over, a heavy spear on one shoulder. \u201CLad,\u201D he said quietly, \u201CI think it would be good for their morale if you showed them a thing or two yourself.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve already given them instruction.\u201D\r\n\u201CWith a spear you knocked the head off of. Going very slowly, with lots of talk. They need to see it, lad. See you.\u201D\r\n\u201CWe\u2019ve been through this, Teft.\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, so we have.\u201D\r\nKaladin smiled. Teft was careful not to look angry or belligerent\u2014he looked as if he were having a normal conversation with Kaladin. \u201CYou\u2019ve been a sergeant before, haven\u2019t you?\u201D\r\n\u201CNever mind that. Come on, just show them a few simple routines.\u201D\r\n\u201CNo, Teft,\u201D Kaladin said, more seriously.\r\nTeft eyed him. \u201CYou going to refuse to fight on the battlefield, just like that Horneater?\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s not like that.\u201D\r\n\u201CWell what is it like?\u201D\r\nKaladin reached for an explanation. \u201CI\u2019ll fight when the time comes. But if I let myself get back into it now, I\u2019ll be too eager. I\u2019ll push to attack now. I\u2019ll have trouble waiting until the men are ready. Trust me, Teft.\u201D\r\nTeft studied him. \u201CYou\u2019re scared of it, lad.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat? No. I\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CI can see it,\u201D Teft said. \u201CAnd I\u2019ve seen it before. Last time you fought for someone, you failed, eh? So now you hesitate to take it up again.\u201D\r\nKaladin paused. \u201CYes,\u201D he admitted. But it was more than that. When he fought again, he would have to become that man from long ago, the man who had been called Stormblessed. The man with confidence and strength. He wasn\u2019t certain he could be that man any longer. That was what scared him.\r\nOnce he held that spear again, there would be no turning back.\r\n\u201CWell.\u201D Teft rubbed his chin. \u201CWhen the time comes, I hope you\u2019re ready. Because this lot will need you.\u201D\r\nKaladin nodded and Teft hurried back to the others, giving some kind of explanation to mollify them."

      "ChapterName": "64: A MAN OF EXTREMES",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\n\u201CThey come from the pit, two dead men, a heart in their hands, and I know that I have seen true glory.\u201D\r\n\u2014Kakashah 1173, 13 seconds pre-death. A rickshaw puller.\r\n\u201CI couldn\u2019t decide if you were interested or not,\u201D Navani said softly to Dalinar as they slowly walked around the grounds of Elhokar\u2019s raised field palace. \u201CHalf the time, you seemed like a flirt\u2014offering hints at courtship, then backing away. The other half of the time, I was certain I had misread you. And Gavilar was so forthcoming. He always did prefer to seize what he wished.\u201D\r\nDalinar nodded thoughtfully. He wore his blue uniform, while Navani was in a subdued maroon dress with a thick hem. Elhokar\u2019s gardeners had begun to cultivate the plant life here. To their right, a twisting length of yellow shalebark rose to waist height, like a railing. The stonelike plant was overgrown by small bunches of haspers with pearly shells slowly opening and closing as they breathed. They looked like tiny mouths, silently speaking in rhythm with one another.\r\nDalinar and Navani\u2019s pathway took a leisurely course up the hillside. Dalinar strolled with hands clasped behind his back. His honor guard and Navani\u2019s clerks followed behind. A few of them looked perplexed at the amount of time Dalinar and Navani were spending with one another. How many of them suspected the truth? All? Part? None? Did it matter? \u201CI didn\u2019t mean to confuse you, all those years ago,\u201D he said, voice soft to keep it from prying ears. \u201CI had intended to court you, but Gavilar expressed a preference for you. So I eventually felt I had to step aside.\u201D\r\n\u201CJust like that?\u201D Navani asked. She sounded offended.\r\n\u201CHe didn\u2019t realize that I was interested. He thought that by introducing you to him, I was indicating that he should court you. That was often how our relationship worked; I would discover people Gavilar should know, then bring them to him. I didn\u2019t realize until too late what I had done in giving you to him.\u201D\r\n\u201C\u2018Giving\u2019 me? Is there a slave\u2019s brand on my forehead of which I\u2019ve been unaware?\u201D\r\n\u201CI did not mean\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201COh hush,\u201D Navani said, her voice suddenly fond. Dalinar stifled a sigh; though Navani had matured since their youth, her moods always\r\nhadchanged as quickly as the seasons. In truth, that was part of her allure.\r\n\u201CDid you often step aside for him?\u201D Navani asked.\r\n\u201CAlways.\u201D\r\n\u201CDidn\u2019t that grow tiresome?\u201D\r\n\u201CI didn\u2019t think about it much,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CWhen I did\u2026 yes, I was frustrated. But it was Gavilar. You know how he was. That force of will, that air of natural entitlement. It always seemed to surprise him when someone denied him or when the world itself didn\u2019t do as he wished. He didn\u2019t force me to defer\u2014it was simply how life was.\u201D\r\nNavani nodded in understanding.\r\n\u201CRegardless,\u201D Dalinar said, \u201CI apologize for confusing you. I\u2026 well, I had difficulty letting go. I fear that\u2014on occasion\u2014I let too much of my true feelings slip out.\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, I suppose I can forgive that,\u201D she said. \u201CThough you did spend the next two decades making certain I thought you hated me.\u201D\r\n\u201CI did nothing of the sort!\u201D\r\n\u201COh? And how else was I to interpret your coldness? The way you would often leave the room when I arrived?\u201D\r\n\u201CContaining myself,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CI had made my decision.\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, it looked a lot like hatred,\u201D Navani said. \u201CThough I did wonder several times what you were hiding behind those stony eyes of yours. Of course, then\r\nShshshshcame along.\u201D\r\nAs always, when the name of his wife was spoken, it came to him as the sound of softly rushing air, then slipped from his mind immediately. He could not hear, or remember, the name.\r\n\u201CShe changed everything,\u201D Navani said. \u201CYou truly seemed to love her.\u201D\r\n\u201CI did,\u201D Dalinar said. Surely he had loved her. Hadn\u2019t he? He could remember nothing. \u201CWhat was she like?\u201D He quickly added, \u201CI mean, in your opinion. How did you see her?\u201D\r\n\u201CEveryone loved\r\nShshshsh,\u201D Navani said. \u201CI tried hard to hate her, but in the end, I could only be mildly jealous.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou? Jealous of her? Whatever for?\u201D\r\n\u201CBecause,\u201D Navani said. \u201CShe fit you so well, never making inappropriate comments, never bullying those around her, always so calm.\u201D Navani smiled. \u201CThinking back, I really should have been able to hate her. But she was just so nice. Though she wasn\u2019t very\u2026 well\u2026\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat?\u201D Dalinar asked.\r\n\u201CClever,\u201D Navani said. She blushed, which was rare for her. \u201CI\u2019m sorry, Dalinar, but she just wasn\u2019t. She wasn\u2019t a fool, but\u2026 well\u2026 not everyone can be cunning. Perhaps that was part of her charm.\u201D\r\nShe seemed to think that Dalinar would be offended. \u201CIt\u2019s all right,\u201D he said. \u201CWere you surprised that I married her?\u201D\r\n\u201CWho could be surprised? As I said, she was perfect for you.\u201D\r\n\u201CBecause we were matched intellectually?\u201D Dalinar said dryly.\r\n\u201CHardly. But you\r\nwerematched in temperament. For a time, after I got over trying to hate her, I thought that the four of us could be quite close. But you were so stiff toward me.\u201D\r\n\u201CI could not allow any further\u2026 lapses to make you think that I was still interested.\u201D He said the last part awkwardly. After all, wasn\u2019t that what he was doing now? Lapsing?\r\nNavani eyed him. \u201CThere you go again.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat?\u201D\r\n\u201CFeeling guilty. Dalinar, you are a wonderful, honorable man\u2014but you really are quite prone to self-indulgence.\u201D\r\nGuilt? As self-indulgence? \u201CI never considered it that way before.\u201D\r\nShe smiled deeply.\r\n\u201CWhat?\u201D he asked.\r\n\u201CYou really are genuine, aren\u2019t you, Dalinar?\u201D\r\n\u201CI try to be,\u201D he said. He glanced over his shoulder. \u201CThough the nature of our relationship continues to perpetuate a kind of lie.\u201D\r\n\u201CWe\u2019ve lied to nobody. Let them think, or guess, what they wish.\u201D\r\n\u201CI suppose you are right.\u201D\r\n\u201CI usually am.\u201D She fell silent for a moment. \u201CDo you regret what we have\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D Dalinar said sharply, the strength of his objection surprising him. Navani just smiled. \u201CNo,\u201D Dalinar continued, more gently. \u201CI do not regret this, Navani. I don\u2019t know how to proceed, but I am\r\nnotgoing to let go.\u201D\r\nNavani hesitated beside a growth of tiny, fist-size rockbuds with their vines out like long green tongues. They were grouped almost like a bouquet, growing on a large oval stone placed beside the pathway.\r\n\u201CI suppose it\u2019s too much to ask for you to not feel guilty,\u201D Navani said. \u201CCan\u2019t you let yourself bend, just a little?\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m not certain if I can. Particularly not now. Explaining why would be difficult.\u201D\r\n\u201CCould you try to? For me?\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2026 Well, I\u2019m a man of extremes, Navani. I discovered that when I was a youth. I\u2019ve learned, repeatedly, that the only way to control those extremes is to dedicate my life to something. First it was Gavilar. Now it\u2019s the Codes and the teachings of Nohadon. They\u2019re the means by which I bind myself. Like the enclosure of a fire, meant to contain and control it.\u201D\r\nHe took a deep breath. \u201CI\u2019m a weak man, Navani. I really am. If I give myself a few feet of leeway, I burst through all of my prohibitions. The momentum of following the Codes these years after Gavilar\u2019s death is what keeps me strong. If I let a few cracks into that armor, I might return to the man I once was. A man I never want to be again.\u201D\r\nA man who had contemplated murdering his own brother for the throne\u2014and for the woman who had married that brother. But he couldn\u2019t explain that, didn\u2019t dare let Navani know what his desire for her had once almost driven him to do.\r\nOn that day, Dalinar had sworn that he would never hold the throne himself. That was one of his restraints. Could he explain how she, without trying, pried at those restraints? How it was difficult to reconcile his long-fermenting love for her with his guilt at finally taking for himself what he\u2019d long ago given up for his brother?\r\n\u201CYou are not a weak man, Dalinar,\u201D Navani said.\r\n\u201CI am. But weakness can imitate strength if bound properly, just as cowardice can imitate heroism if given nowhere to flee.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut there\u2019s nothing in Gavilar\u2019s book that prohibits us. It\u2019s just tradition that\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CIt feels wrong,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CBut please, don\u2019t worry; I do enough worrying for both of us. I will find a way to make this work; I just ask your understanding. It will take time. When I display frustration, it is not with you, but with the situation.\u201D\r\n\u201CI suppose I can accept that. Assuming you can live with the rumors. They\u2019re starting already.\u201D\r\n\u201CThey won\u2019t be the first rumors to plague me,\u201D he said. \u201CI\u2019m starting to worry less about them and more about Elhokar. How will we explain to him?\u201D\r\n\u201CI doubt he\u2019ll notice,\u201D Navani said, snorting softly, resuming her walk. He followed. \u201CHe\u2019s so fixated on the Parshendi and, occasionally, the idea that someone in camp is trying to kill him.\u201D\r\n\u201CThis might feed into that,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CHe could read a number of conspiracies out of the two of us entering a relationship.\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, he\u2014\u201D\r\nHorns began sounding loudly from below. Dalinar and Navani stopped to listen and identify the call.\r\n\u201CStormfather,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CThat\u2019s the\r\nTower itselfwhere a chasmfiend has been seen. It\u2019s one of the plateaus Sadeas has been watching.\u201D Dalinar felt a surge of excitement. \u201CHighprinces have failed every time to win a gemheart there. It will be a major victory if he and I can do it together.\u201D\r\nNavani looked troubled. \u201CYou\u2019re right about him, Dalinar. We\r\ndoneed him for our cause. But keep him at arm\u2019s length.\u201D\r\n\u201CWish me the wind\u2019s favor.\u201D He reached toward her, but then stopped himself. What was he going to do? Embrace her here, in public? That would set off the rumors like fire across a pool of oil. He wasn\u2019t ready for that yet. Instead, he bowed to her, then hastened off to answer the call and collect his Shardplate.\r\nIt wasn\u2019t until he was halfway down the path that he paused to consider Navani\u2019s choice of words. She had said \u201CWe need him\u201D for \u201Cour cause.\u201D\r\nWhat was their cause? He doubted that Navani knew either. But she had already started to think of them as together in their efforts.\r\nAnd, he realized, so did he.\r\nThe horns called, such a pure and beautiful sound to signify the imminence of battle. It caused a frenzy in the lumberyard. The orders had come down. The Tower was to be assaulted again\u2014the very place where Bridge Four had failed, the place where Kaladin had caused a disaster.\r\nLargest of the plateaus. Most coveted.\r\nBridgemen ran this way and that for their vests. Carpenters and apprentices rushed out of the way. Matal shouted orders; an actual run was the only time he did that without Hashal. Bridgeleaders, showing a modicum of leadership, bellowed for their teams to line up.\r\nA wind whipped the air, blowing wood chips and bits of dried grass into the sky. Men yelled, bells rang. And into this chaos strode Bridge Four, Kaladin at their head. Despite the urgency, soldiers stopped, bridgemen gaped, carpenters and apprentices stilled.\r\nThirty-five men marched in rusty orange carapace armor, expertly crafted by Leyten to fit onto leather jerkins and caps. They\u2019d cut off arm guards and shin guards to complement the breastplates. The helms were built from several different headpieces, and had been ornamented\u2014at Leyten\u2019s insistence\u2014with ridges and cuts, like tiny horns or the edges of a crab\u2019s shell. The breastplates and guards were ornamented as well, cut into toothlike patterns, each one reminiscent of a saw blade. Earless Jaks had bought blue and white paint and drawn designs across the orange armor.\r\nEach member of Bridge Four carried a large wooden shield strapped\u2014 tightly now\u2014with red Parshendi bones. Ribs, for the most part, shaped in spiral patterns. Some of the men had tied finger bones to the centers so they would rattle, and others had attached protruding sharp ribs to the sides of their helms, giving them the look of fangs or mandibles.\r\nThe onlookers watched with amazement. It wasn\u2019t the first time they\u2019d seen this armor, but this would be the first run where every man of Bridge Four had it. All together, it made an impressive sight.\r\nTen days, with six bridge runs, had allowed Kaladin and his team to perfect their method. Five men to be decoys with five more in the front holding shields and using only one arm to support the bridge. Their numbers were augmented by the wounded they\u2019d saved from other crews, now strong enough to help carry.\r\nSo far\u2014despite six bridge runs\u2014there hadn\u2019t been a single fatality. The other bridgemen were whispering about a miracle. Kaladin didn\u2019t know about that. He just made certain to keep a full pouch of infused spheres with him at all times. Most of the Parshendi archers seemed to focus on him. Somehow, they could tell that he was the center of all this.\r\nThey reached their bridge and formed up, shields strapped to rods on the sides to await use. As they hefted their bridge, a spontaneous round of cheering rose up from the other crews.\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s new,\u201D Teft said from Kaladin\u2019s left.\r\n\u201CGuess they finally realized what we are,\u201D Kaladin said.\r\n\u201CAnd what\u2019s that?\u201D\r\nKaladin settled the bridge onto his shoulders. \u201CWe\u2019re their champions. Bridge forward!\u201D\r\nThey broke into a trot, leading the way down from the staging yard, ushered by cheers.\r\nMy father is not insane,Adolin thought, alive with energy and excitement as his armorers strapped on his Shardplate.\r\nAdolin had stewed over Navani\u2019s revelation for days. He\u2019d been wrong in such a horrible way. Dalinar Kholin\r\nwasn\u2019tgrowing weak. He\r\nwasn\u2019tgetting senile. He\r\nwasn\u2019ta coward. Dalinar had been right, and Adolin had been wrong. After much soul searching, Adolin had come to a decision.\r\nHe was\r\ngladthat he\u2019d been wrong.\r\nHe grinned, flexing the fingers of his Plated hand as the armorers moved to his other side. He didn\u2019t know what the visions meant, or what the implications of those visions would be. His father was some kind of prophet, and that was daunting to consider.\r\nBut for now, it was enough that Dalinar was not insane. It was time to trust him. Stormfather knew, Dalinar had earned that right from his sons.\r\nThe armorers finished with Adolin\u2019s Shardplate. As they stepped away, Adolin hurried out of the armoring room into the sunlight, adjusting to the combined strength, speed, and weight of the Shardplate. Niter and five other members of the Cobalt Guard hastened up, one bringing Sureblood to him. Adolin took the reins, but led the Ryshadium at first, wanting more time to adapt to his Plate.\r\nThey soon entered the staging area. Dalinar\u2019s father, in his Shardplate, was conferring with Teleb and Ilamar. He seemed to tower over them as he pointed eastward. Already, companies of soldiers were moving out onto the lip of the Plains.\r\nAdolin strode up to his father, eager. In the near distance, he noticed a figure riding down along the eastern rim of the warcamps. The figure wore gleaming red Shardplate.\r\n\u201CFather?\u201D Adolin said, pointing. \u201CWhat\u2019s he doing here? Shouldn\u2019t he be waiting for us to ride to his camp?\u201D\r\nDalinar looked up. He waved for a groom to bring Gallant, and the two of them mounted. They rode down to intercept Sadeas, trailed by a dozen members of the Cobalt Guard. Did Sadeas want to call off the assault? Was he worried about failing against the Tower again?\r\nOnce they drew close, Dalinar pulled up. \u201CYou should be moving, Sadeas. Speed will be important, if we\u2019re to get to the plateau before the Parshendi take the gemheart and go.\u201D\r\nThe highprince nodded. \u201CAgreed, in part. But we need to confer first. Dalinar, this is the Tower we\u2019re assaulting!\u201D He seemed eager.\r\n\u201CYes, and?\u201D\r\n\u201CDamnation, man!\u201D Sadeas said. \u201CYou\u2019re the one who told me we needed to find a way to trap a large force of Parshendi on a plateau. The Tower is\r\nperfect. They always bring a large force there, and two sides are inaccessible.\u201D\r\nAdolin found himself nodding. \u201CYes,\u201D he said. \u201CFather, he\u2019s right. If we can box them in and hit them hard\u2026\u201D The Parshendi normally fled when they took large losses. That was one of the things extending the war so long.\r\n\u201CIt could mean a turning point in the war,\u201D Sadeas said, eyes alight. \u201CMy scribes estimate that they have no more than twenty or thirty thousand troops left. The Parshendi will commit ten thousand here\u2014they always do. But if we can corner and kill all of them, we could nearly\r\ndestroytheir ability to wage war on these Plains.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\u2019ll work, Father,\u201D Adolin said eagerly. \u201CThis could be what we\u2019ve been waiting for\u2014what\r\nyou\u2019vebeen waiting for. A way to turn the war, a way to deal enough damage to the Parshendi that they can\u2019t afford to keep fighting!\u201D\r\n\u201CWe need troops, Dalinar,\u201D Sadeas said. \u201CLots of them. How many men could you field, at maximum?\u201D\r\n\u201COn short notice?\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CEight thousand, perhaps.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt will have to do,\u201D Sadeas said. \u201CI\u2019ve managed to mobilize about seven thousand. We\u2019ll bring them all. Get your eight thousand to my camp, and we\u2019ll take every one of my bridge crews and march together. The Parshendi will get there first\u2014it\u2019s inevitable with a plateau that close to their side\u2014but if we can be fast enough, we can corner them on the plateau. Then we\u2019ll show them what a\r\nrealAlethi army is capable of!\u201D\r\n\u201CI won\u2019t risk lives on your bridges, Sadeas,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CI don\u2019t know that I can agree to a completely joint assault.\u201D\r\n\u201CBah,\u201D Sadeas said. \u201CI\u2019ve got a new way of using bridgemen, one that doesn\u2019t use nearly as many lives. Their casualties have dropped to almost nothing.\u201D\r\n\u201CReally?\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CIs it because of those bridgemen with armor? What made you change?\u201D\r\nSadeas shrugged. \u201CPerhaps you\u2019re getting through to me. Regardless, we need to go now. Together. With as many troops as they\u2019ll have, I can\u2019t risk engaging them and waiting for you to catch up. I want to go together and assault as closely together as we can manage. If you\u2019re still worried about the bridgemen, I can attack first and gain a foothold, then let you cross without risking bridgeman lives.\u201D\r\nDalinar looked thoughtful.\r\nCome on, Father,Adolin thought.\r\nYou\u2019ve been waiting for a chance to hit the Parshendi hard. This is it!\r\n\u201CVery well,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CAdolin, send messengers to mobilize the Fourth through Eighth Divisions. Prepare the men to march. Let\u2019s end this war.\u201D"

      "ChapterName": "65: THE TOWER",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\n\u201CI see them. They are the rocks. They are the vengeful spirits. Eyes of red.\u201D\r\n\u2014Kakakes 1173, 8 seconds pre-death. A darkeyed young woman of fifteen. Subject was reportedly mentally unstable since childhood.\r\nSeveral hours later, Dalinar stood with Sadeas on a rock formation overlooking the Tower itself. It had been a hard, long march. This was a distant plateau, as far eastward as they had ever struck. Plateaus beyond this point were impossible to take. The Parshendi could arrive so quickly that they had the gemheart out before the Alethi arrived. Sometimes that happened with the Tower as well.\r\nDalinar searched. \u201CI see it,\u201D he said, pointing. \u201CThey don\u2019t have the gemheart out yet!\u201D A ring of Parshendi were pounding on the chrysalis. Its shell was like thick stone, however. It was still holding.\r\n\u201CYou should be glad you\u2019re using my bridges, old friend.\u201D Sadeas shaded his face with a gauntleted hand. \u201CThose chasms might be too wide for a Shardbearer to jump.\u201D\r\nDalinar nodded. The Tower was enormous; even its huge size on the maps didn\u2019t do it justice. Unlike other plateaus, it wasn\u2019t level\u2014instead, it was shaped like an enormous wedge that dipped toward the west, pointing a large cliff face in the stormward direction. It was too steep\u2014and the chasms too wide\u2014to approach from the east or south. Only three adjacent plateaus could provide staging areas for assaults, all along the western or northwestern side.\r\nThe chasms between these plateaus were unusually large, almost too wide for the bridges to span. On the nearby staging plateaus, thousands upon thousands of soldiers in blue or red were gathered, one color per plateau. Combined, they made for a larger force than Dalinar had ever seen brought against the Parshendi.\r\nThe Parshendi numbers were as large as anticipated. There were at least ten thousand of them lining up. This would be a full-scale battle, the kind Dalinar had been hoping for, the kind that would let them pit a huge number of Alethi against a large Parshendi force.\r\nThis\r\ncouldbe it. The turning point in the war. Win this day, and everything would change.\r\nDalinar shaded his eyes as well, helm under his arm. He noted with satisfaction that Sadeas\u2019s scouting crews were crossing to adjacent plateaus where they could watch for Parshendi reinforcements. Just because the Parshendi had brought so many at first didn\u2019t mean that there were no other Parshendi forces waiting to flank them. Dalinar and Sadeas wouldn\u2019t be taken by surprise again.\r\n\u201CCome with me,\u201D Sadeas said. \u201CLet us assault them together! A single grand wave of attack, across forty bridges!\u201D\r\nDalinar looked down at the bridge crews; many of their members were lying exhausted on the plateau. Awaiting\u2014likely dreading\u2014their next task. Very few of them wore the armor Sadeas had spoken of. Hundreds of them would be slaughtered in the assault if they attacked together. But was that any different from what Dalinar did, asking his men to charge into battle to seize the plateau? Weren\u2019t they all part of the same army?\r\nThe cracks. He couldn\u2019t let them get wider. If he was going to be with Navani, he had to prove to himself he could remain firm in the other areas. \u201CNo,\u201D he said. \u201CI will attack, but only after you\u2019ve made a landing point for my bridge crews. Even that is more than I should allow. Never force your men to do as you yourself would not.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou do charge the Parshendi!\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019d never do it carrying one of those bridges,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CI\u2019m sorry, old friend. It\u2019s not a judgment of you. It is what I must do.\u201D\r\nSadeas shook his head, pulling on his helmet. \u201CWell, it will have to do. We still planning on dining together tonight to discuss strategy?\u201D\r\n\u201CI assume so. Unless Elhokar has a fit for both of us missing his feast.\u201D\r\nSadeas snorted. \u201CHe\u2019s going to have to grow accustomed to it. Six years of feasting every night is growing tedious. Besides, I doubt he\u2019ll feel anything but elation after we win this day and leave the Parshendi down a full third of their soldiers. See you on the battlefield.\u201D\r\nDalinar nodded and Sadeas jumped off the rock formation, dropping down to the surface below and joining his officers. Dalinar lingered, looking over at the Tower. It was not only larger than most plateaus, it was rougher, covered with lumpish rock formations of hardened crem. The patterns were rolling and smooth, yet very uneven\u2014like a field full of short walls covered by a blanket of snow.\r\nThe southeastern tip of the plateau rose to a point overlooking the Plains. The two plateaus they\u2019d use were on the middle of the west side; Sadeas would take the northern one and Dalinar would assault from one just below it, once Sadeas had cleared a landing for him.\r\nWe need to push the Parshendi to the southeast,Dalinar thought, rubbing his chin,\r\ncorner them there.Everything hinged on that. The chrysalis was up near the top, so the Parshendi were already situated in a good position for Dalinar and Sadeas to push them back against the cliff edge. The Parshendi would probably allow this, as it would give them the high ground.\r\nIf a second Parshendi army came, it would be separated from the others. The Alethi could focus on the Parshendi trapped atop the Tower while holding a defensive formation against the new arrivals. It\r\nwouldwork.\r\nHe felt himself growing excited. He hopped down to a shorter outcropping, then walked down a few steplike clefts to reach the plateau floor, where his officers waited. He then rounded the rock formation, investigating Adolin\u2019s progress. The young man stood in his Shardplate, directing the companies as they crossed Sadeas\u2019s mobile bridges onto the southern staging plateau. In the near distance, Sadeas\u2019s men were forming up for the assault.\r\nThat group of armored bridgemen stood out, preparing at the front center of the formation of bridge crews. Why\r\nwerethey allowed armor? Why not the others as well? It looked like Parshendi carapace. Dalinar shook his head. The assault began, bridge crews running out ahead of Sadeas\u2019s army, approaching the Tower first.\r\n\u201CWhere would you like to make our assault, Father?\u201D Adolin asked, summoning his Shardblade and resting it on his pauldron, sharp side up.\r\n\u201CThere,\u201D Dalinar said, pointing to a spot on their staging plateau. \u201CGet the men ready.\u201D\r\nAdolin nodded, shouting the orders.\r\nIn the distance, bridgemen began to die.\r\nHeralds guide your paths, you poor men,Dalinar thought.\r\nAs well as my own.\r\nKaladin danced with the wind.\r\nArrows streamed around him, passing close, nearly kissing him with their painted scragglebark fletching. He had to let them get close, had to make the Parshendi feel they were near to killing him.\r\nDespite four other bridgemen drawing their attention, despite the other men of Bridge Four behind armored with the skeletons of fallen Parshendi, most of the archers focused on Kaladin. He was a symbol. A living banner to destroy.\r\nKaladin spun between arrows, slapping them away with his shield. A storm raged inside him, as if his blood had been sucked away and replaced with stormwinds. It made his fingertips tingle with energy. Ahead, the Parshendi sang their angry, chanting song. The song for one who blasphemed against their dead.\r\nKaladin stayed at the front of the decoys, letting the arrows fall close. Daring them. Taunting them. Demanding they kill him until the arrows stopped falling and the wind stilled.\r\nKaladin came to rest, breath held to contain the storm within. The Parshendi reluctantly fell back before Sadeas\u2019s force. An enormous force, as far as plateau assaults went. Thousands of men and thirty-two bridges. Despite Kaladin\u2019s distraction, five bridges had been dropped, the men carrying them slaughtered.\r\nNone of the soldiers rushing across the chasm had made any specific effort to attack the archers firing on Kaladin, but the weight of numbers had forced them away. A few gave Kaladin loathing gazes, making an odd gesture by cupping a hand to the right ear and pointing at him before finally retreating.\r\nKaladin released his breath, Stormlight pulsing away from him. He had to walk a very fine line, drawing in enough Stormlight to stay alive, but not so much that it was visible to the watching soldiers.\r\nThe Tower rose ahead of him, a slab of stone that dipped toward the west. The chasm was so wide that he\u2019d worried the men would drop the bridge into the chasm as they tried to place it. On the other side, Sadeas had arrayed his forces in a cupping shape, pushing the Parshendi back away, trying to give Dalinar an opening.\r\nPerhaps attacking this way served to protect Dalinar\u2019s pristine image. He wouldn\u2019t make bridgemen die. Not directly, at least. Never mind that he stood on the backs of the men who had fallen to get Sadeas across. Their corpses were his true bridge.\r\n\u201CKaladin!\u201D a voice called from behind.\r\nKaladin spun. One of his men was wounded.\r\nStorm it!he thought, dashing up to Bridge Four. There was enough Stormlight still pulsing in his veins to stave off exhaustion. He\u2019d grown complacent. Six bridge runs without a casualty. He should have realized it couldn\u2019t last. He pushed through the collected bridgemen to find Skar on the ground, holding his foot, red blood seeping between his fingers.\r\n\u201CArrow in the foot,\u201D Skar said through gritted teeth. \u201CIn the storming foot! Who gets hit in the foot?\u201D\r\n\u201CKaladin!\u201D Moash\u2019s voice said, urgent. The bridgemen split as Moash brought Teft in, an arrow sprouting from his shoulder between carapace breastplate and arm.\r\n\u201CStorm it!\u201D Kaladin said, helping Moash set Teft down. The older bridgeman looked dazed. The arrow had dug deep into the muscle. \u201CSomebody get pressure on Skar\u2019s foot and wrap it until I can look at it. Teft, can you hear me?\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m sorry, lad,\u201D Teft mumbled, eyes glassy. \u201CI\u2019m\u2026\u201D\r\n\u201CYou\u2019re all right,\u201D Kaladin said, hurriedly taking some bandages from Lopen, then nodding grimly. Lopen would heat a knife for cauterizing. \u201CWho else?\u201D\r\n\u201CEveryone else is accounted for,\u201D Drehy said. \u201CTeft was trying to hide his wound. He must have taken it when we were shoving the bridge across.\u201D\r\nKaladin pressed gauze against the wound, then gestured for Lopen to hurry with the heated knife. \u201CI want our scouts watching. Make sure the Parshendi don\u2019t try a stunt like they did a few weeks back! If they jump across that plateau to get at Bridge Four, we\u2019re dead.\u201D\r\n\u201CIs all right,\u201D Rock said, shading his eyes. \u201CSadeas is keeping his men in this area. No Parshendi will get through.\u201D\r\nThe knife came, and Kaladin held it hesitantly, a curl of smoke rising from its length. Teft had lost too much blood; there was no risking a sewing. But with the twist of the knife, Kaladin risked some bad scarring. That could leave the aging bridgeman with a stiff ness that would hurt his ability to wield a spear.\r\nReluctantly, Kaladin pressed the knife into the wound, the flesh hissing and blood drying to black crisps. Painspren wiggled out of the ground, sinewy and orange. In a surgery, you could sew. But on the field, this was often the only way.\r\n\u201CI\u2019m sorry, Teft.\u201D He shook his head as he continued to work.\r\nMen began to scream. Arrows hit wood and flesh, sounding like distant woodsmen swinging axes.\r\nDalinar waited beside his men, watching Sadeas\u2019s soldiers fight.\r\nHe had better give us an opening,he thought.\r\nI\u2019m starting to hunger for this plateau.\r\nFortunately, Sadeas quickly gained his footing on the Tower and sent a flanking force over to carve out a section of land for Dalinar. They didn\u2019t get entirely into place before Dalinar started moving.\r\n\u201COne of you bridges, come with me!\u201D he bellowed, barreling to the forefront. He was followed by one of the eight bridge teams Sadeas had lent him.\r\nDalinar needed to get onto that plateau. The Parshendi had noticed what was happening and had begun to put pressure on the small company in green and white that Sadeas had sent to defend his entry area. \u201CBridge crew, there!\u201D Dalinar said, pointing.\r\nThe bridgemen hustled into place, looking relieved that they wouldn\u2019t be asked to place their bridge under fire of arrows. As soon as they got it into position, Dalinar charged across, the Cobalt Guard following. Just ahead, Sadeas\u2019s men broke.\r\nDalinar bellowed, closing his gauntleted hands around Oathbringer\u2019s hilt as the sword formed from mist. He crashed into the surging Parshendi line with a wide, two-handed sweep that dropped four men. The Parshendi began to chant in their strange language, singing their war song. Dalinar kicked a corpse aside and began to attack in earnest, frantically defending the foothold Sadeas\u2019s men had gained him. Within minutes, his soldiers surged around him.\r\nWith the Cobalt Guard watching his back, Dalinar waded into the battle, breaking enemy ranks as only a Shardbearer could. He tore pockets through the Parshendi front lines, like a fish leaping from a stream, cutting back and forth, keeping his enemies disorganized. Corpses with burned eyes and slashed clothing made a trail behind him. More and more Alethi troops filled in the holes. Adolin crashed through a group of Parshendi nearby, his own squad of Cobalt Guardsmen a safe distance behind. He brought his whole army across\u2014he needed to ascend quickly, pinning the Parshendi back so they couldn\u2019t escape. Sadeas was to watch the northern and western edges of the Tower.\r\nThe rhythm of the battle sang to Dalinar. The Parshendi chanting, the soldiers grunting and yelling, the Shardblade in his hands and the surging power of the Plate. The Thrill rose within him. Since the nausea didn\u2019t strike him, he carefully let the Blackthorn free, and felt the joy of dominating a battlefield and the disappointment at lacking a worthy foe.\r\nWhere were the Parshendi Shardbearers? He had seen that one in battle weeks ago. Why had he not reappeared? Would they commit so many men to the Tower without sending a Shardbearer?\r\nSomething heavy hit his armor, banging off it, causing a small puff of Stormlight to escape between the joints along his upper arm. Dalinar cursed, raising an arm to protect his face while scanning the near distance.\r\nThere,he thought, picking out a nearby rock formation where a group of Parshendi stood swinging enormous rock slings with two hands. The head-size stones crashed into Parshendi and Alethi alike, though Dalinar was obviously the target.\r\nHe growled as another one hit, smashing against his forearm, sending a soft jolt through the Shardplate. The blow was strong enough to send a small array of cracks through his right vambrace.\r\nDalinar growled and threw himself into a Plate-enhanced run. The Thrill surged more strongly through him, and he rammed his shoulder into a group of Parshendi, scattering them, then spun with his Blade and cut down those too slow to get out of his way. He dodged to the side as a hail of stones fell where he\u2019d been standing, then leaped onto a low boulder. He took two steps and jumped for the ledge where the rock-throwers were standing.\r\nHe grabbed its edge with one hand, holding his Blade with the other. The men atop the small ridge stumbled back, but Dalinar heaved himself up just high enough to swing. Oathbringer cut at their legs, and four men tumbled to the ground, feet dead. Dalinar dropped the Blade\u2014it vanished\u2014and used both hands to heave himself onto the ridge.\r\nHe landed in a crouch, Plate clanking. Several of the remaining Parshendi tried to swing their slings, but Dalinar grabbed a pair of head-size stones from a pile\u2014easily palming them in his gauntleted hands\u2014and flung them at the Parshendi. The stones hit with enough force to toss the slingmen off the formation, crushing their chests.\r\nDalinar smiled, then began throwing more stones. As the last Parshendi fell off the ledge, Dalinar spun, summoning Oathbringer and looking over the battlefield. A spear wall of blue and reflective steel struggled against black and red Parshendi. Dalinar\u2019s men did well, pressing the Parshendi up to the southeast, where they would be trapped. Adolin led this effort, Shardplate gleaming.\r\nBreathing deeply from the Thrill now, Dalinar held his Shardblade up above his head, reflecting sunlight. Below, his men cheered, sending up calls that rose above the Parshendi war chant. Gloryspren sprouted around him.\r\nStormfather, but it felt good to be winning again. He threw himself off the rock formation, for once not taking the slow and careful way down. He fell amid a group of Parshendi, crashing to the stones, blue Stormlight rising from his armor. He spun, slaying, remembering years spent fighting alongside Gavilar. Winning, conquering.\r\nHe and Gavilar had created something during those years. A solidified, cohesive nation out of something fractured. Like master potters reconstructing a fine ceramic that had been dropped. With a roar, Dalinar cut through the line of Parshendi, to where the Cobalt Guard was fighting to catch up to him. \u201CWe press them!\u201D he bellowed. \u201CPass the word! All companies up the side of the Tower!\u201D\r\nSoldiers raised spears and runners went to deliver his orders. Dalinar spun and charged into the Parshendi, pushing himself\u2014and his army\u2014 forward. To the north, Sadeas\u2019s forces were stalled. Well, Dalinar\u2019s force would do the work for him. If Dalinar could spear forward here, he could slice the Parshendi in half, then crush the northern side against Sadeas and the southern side against the cliff edge.\r\nHis army surged forward behind him, and the Thrill bubbled within. It was power. Strength greater than Shardplate. Vitality greater than youth. Skill greater than a lifetime of practice. A fever of power. Parshendi after Parshendi fell before his Blade. He couldn\u2019t cut their flesh, yet he sheared through their ranks. The momentum of their attacks often carried their corpses stumbling past him even as their eyes burned. The Parshendi started to break, running away or falling back. He grinned behind his near-translucent visor.\r\nThis was life. This was control. Gavilar had been the leader, the momentum, and the essence of their conquest. But Dalinar had been the warrior. Their opponents had surrendered to Gavilar\u2019s rule, but the Blackthorn\u2014he was the man who had scattered them, the one who had dueled their leaders and slain their best Shardbearers.\r\nDalinar screamed at the Parshendi, and their entire line bent, then shattered. The Alethi surged forward, cheering. Dalinar joined his men, charging at their forefront to run down the fleeing Parshendi warpairs as they fled to the north or south, trying to join larger groups who held there.\r\nHe reached a pair. One turned to hold him off with a hammer, but Dalinar cut him down in passing, then grabbed the other Parshendi and threw him down with a twist of the arm. Grinning, Dalinar raised his Blade high over his head, looming over the soldier.\r\nThe Parshendi rolled awkwardly, holding his arm, no doubt shattered as he was thrown down. He looked up at Dalinar, terrified, fearspren appearing around him.\r\nHe was only a youth.\r\nDalinar froze, Blade held above his head, muscles taut. Those eyes\u2026 that face\u2026 Parshendi might not be human, but their features\u2014their expressions\u2014were the same. Save for the marbled skin and the strange growths of carapace armor, this boy could have been a groom in Dalinar\u2019s stable. What did he see above him? A faceless monster in impervious armor? What was this youth\u2019s story? He would only have been a boy when Gavilar had been assassinated.\r\nDalinar stumbled backward, the Thrill vanishing. One of the Cobalt Guardsmen passed by, casually ramming a sword into the Parshendi boy\u2019s neck. Dalinar raised a hand, but it was over too quickly for him to stop. The soldier didn\u2019t notice Dalinar\u2019s gesture.\r\nDalinar lowered his hand. His men were rushing around him, rolling over the fleeing Parshendi. The majority of the Parshendi still fought, resisting Sadeas on one side and Dalinar\u2019s force on the other. The eastern plateau edge was just a short distance to Dalinar\u2019s right\u2014he had come up against the Parshendi force like a spear, slicing it through the center, splitting it off to the north and south.\r\nAround him lay the dead. Many of them had fallen face-down, taken in the back by spears or arrows from Dalinar\u2019s forces. Some Parshendi were still alive, though dying. They hummed or whispered to themselves a strange, haunting song. The one they sang as they waited to die.\r\nTheir whispered songs rose like the curses of spirits on Soul\u2019s March. Dalinar had always found the death song the most beautiful of all he had heard from the Parshendi. It seemed to cut through the grunts, clangs, and screams of the nearby battle. As always, each Parshendi\u2019s song was in perfect time with that of his fellows. It was as if they could all hear the same melody somewhere far away, singing along through sputtering, bloodied lips, with rasping breath.\r\nThe Codes,Dalinar thought, turning toward his fighting men.\r\nNever ask of your men a sacrifice you wouldn\u2019t make yourself. Never make them fight in conditions you would refuse to fight in yourself. Never ask a man to perform an act you wouldn\u2019t soil your own hands doing.\r\nHe felt sick. This wasn\u2019t beautiful. This wasn\u2019t glorious. This wasn\u2019t strength, power, or life. This was revolting, repellent, and ghastly.\r\nBut they killed Gavilar!he thought, searching for a way to overcome the sickness he suddenly felt.\r\nUnite them\u2026.\r\nRoshar had been united, once. Had that included the Parshendi?\r\nYou don\u2019t know if you can trust the visions or not, he told himself, his honor guard forming up behind him.\r\nThey could be from the Nightwatcher or the Voidbringers. Or something else entirely.\r\nIn that moment, the objections felt weak. What had the visions wanted him to do? Bring peace to Alethkar, unite his people, act with justice and honor. Could he not judge the visions based on those results?\r\nHe raised his Shardblade to his shoulder, walking solemnly among the fallen toward the northern line, where the Parshendi were trapped between his men and Sadeas\u2019s. His sickness grew stronger.\r\nWhat was\r\nhappeningto him?\r\n\u201CFather!\u201D Adolin\u2019s shout was frantic.\r\nDalinar turned toward his son, who was running to him. The young man\u2019s Plate was sprayed with Parshendi blood, but as always his Blade gleamed.\r\n\u201CWhat do we do?\u201D Adolin asked, panting.\r\n\u201CAbout what?\u201D Dalinar asked.\r\nAdolin turned, pointing to the west\u2014toward the plateau south of the one from which Dalinar\u2019s army had begun their assault over an hour ago. There, leaping across the wide chasm, was an enormous second army of Parshendi.\r\nDalinar slammed his visor up, fresh air washing across his sweaty face. He stepped forward. He\u2019d anticipated this possibility, but someone should have given warning. Where were the scouts? What was\u2014\r\nHe felt a chill.\r\nShaking, he scrambled toward one of the smooth, bulging formations of rock that were plentiful on the Tower.\r\n\u201CFather?\u201D Adolin said, running after him.\r\nDalinar climbed, seeking the top of the formation, dropping his Shardblade. He crested the rise and stood looking northward over his troops and the Parshendi. Northward, toward Sadeas. Adolin climbed up beside him, gauntleted hand slapping up his visor.\r\n\u201COh no\u2026\u201D he whispered.\r\nSadeas\u2019s army was retreating across the chasm to the northern staging plateau. Half of it was across already. The eight groups of bridgemen he\u2019d lent Dalinar had pulled back and were gone.\r\nSadeas was abandoning Dalinar and his troops, leaving them surrounded on three sides by Parshendi, alone on the Shattered Plains. And he was taking all of his bridges with him."

      "ChapterName": "66: CODES",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\n\u201CThat chanting, that singing, those rasping voices.\u201D\r\n\u2014Kaktach 1173, 16 seconds pre-death. A middle-aged potter. Reported seeing strange dreams during highstorms during the last two years.\r\nKaladin wearily unwrapped Skar\u2019s wound to inspect his stitches and change the bandage. The arrow had hit on the right side of the ankle, deflecting off the knob of the fibula and scraping down through the muscles on the side of the foot.\r\n\u201CYou were very lucky, Skar,\u201D Kaladin said, putting on the new bandage. \u201CYou\u2019ll walk on this again, assuming you do\r\nnotput weight on it until it\u2019s healed. We\u2019ll have some of the men carry you back to camp.\u201D\r\nBehind them, the screaming, pounding, pulsing battle raged on. The fighting was distant now, focused on the eastern edge of the plateau. To Kaladin\u2019s right, Teft drank as Lopen poured water into his mouth. The older man scowled, taking the waterskin from Lopen with his good hand. \u201CI\u2019m not an invalid,\u201D he snapped. He\u2019d gotten over his initial dizziness, though he was weak.\r\nKaladin sat back, feeling drained. When Stormlight faded away, it left him exhausted. That should pass soon; it had been over an hour since the initial assault. He carried a few more infused spheres in his pouch; he forced himself to resist the urge to suck in their Light.\r\nHe stood up, meaning to gather some men to carry Moash and Teft toward the far side of the plateau, just in case the battle went poorly and they had to retreat. That wasn\u2019t likely; the Alethi soldiers had been doing well the last time he\u2019d checked.\r\nHe scanned the battlefield again. What he saw made him freeze.\r\nSadeas was retreating.\r\nAt first, it seemed so impossible that Kaladin couldn\u2019t accept it. Was Sadeas bringing his men around to attack in another direction? But no, the rear guard was already across the bridges, and Sadeas\u2019s banner was approaching. Was the highprince wounded?\r\n\u201CDrehy, Leyten, grab Skar. Rock and Peet, you take Teft. Hustle to the western side of the plateau in preparation to flee. The rest of you, get into bridge positions.\u201D\r\nThe men, only now noticing what was going on, responded with anxiety.\r\n\u201CMoash, you\u2019re with me,\u201D Kaladin said, hastening toward their bridge.\r\nMoash hurried up beside Kaladin. \u201CWhat\u2019s going on?\u201D\r\n\u201CSadeas is pulling out,\u201D Kaladin said, watching the tide of Sadeas\u2019s men in green slide away from the Parshendi lines like wax melting. \u201CThere\u2019s no reason to. The battle\u2019s barely begun, and his forces were winning. I can only think that Sadeas must have been wounded.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhy would they withdraw the entire army for that?\u201D Moash said. \u201CYou don\u2019t think he is\u2026\u201D\r\n\u201CHis banner still flies,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CSo he\u2019s probably not dead. Unless they left it up to keep the men from panicking.\u201D\r\nHe and Moash reached the side of the bridge. Behind, the rest of the crew hastened to form a line. Matal was on the other side of the chasm, speaking with the commander of the rear guard. After a quick exchange, Matal crossed and began to run down the line of bridge crews, calling for them to prepare to carry. He glanced at Kaladin\u2019s team, but saw they were already ready, and so hurried on.\r\nTo Kaladin\u2019s right, on the adjacent plateau\u2014the one where Dalinar had launched his assault\u2014the eight lent bridge crews pulled away from the battlefield, crossing over to Kaladin\u2019s plateau. A lighteyed officer Kaladin didn\u2019t recognize was giving them orders. Beyond them, farther to the southwest, a new Parshendi force had arrived, and was pouring onto the Tower.\r\nSadeas rode up to the chasm. The paint on his Shardplate gleamed in the sun; it didn\u2019t bear a single scratch. In fact, his entire honor guard was unharmed. Though they had gone over to the Tower, they had disengaged the enemy and come back. Why?\r\nAnd then Kaladin saw it. Dalinar Kholin\u2019s force, fighting on the upper middle slope of the wedge, was now surrounded. This new Parshendi force was flooding into sections that Sadeas had held, supposedly protecting Dalinar\u2019s retreat.\r\n\u201CThey\u2019re abandoning him!\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CThis was a trap. A setup. Sadeas is leaving Highprince Kholin\u2014and all of his soldiers\u2014to die.\u201D Kaladin scrambled around the end of the bridge, pushing through the soldiers who were coming off it. Moash cursed and followed.\r\nKaladin wasn\u2019t certain why he elbowed his way up to the next bridge\u2014 bridge ten\u2014where Sadeas was crossing. Perhaps he needed to see for certain that Sadeas wasn\u2019t wounded. Perhaps he was still stunned. This was treachery on a grand scale, terrible enough that it made Amaram\u2019s betrayal of Kaladin seem almost trivial.\r\nSadeas trotted his horse across the bridge, the wood clattering. He was accompanied by two lighteyed men in regular armor, and all three had their helms under their arms, as if they were on parade.\r\nThe honor guard stopped Kaladin, looking hostile. He was still close enough to see that Sadeas was, indeed, completely unharmed. He was also close enough to study Sadeas\u2019s proud face as he turned his horse and looked back at the Tower. The second Parshendi army swarmed Kholin\u2019s army, trapping them. Even without that, Kholin had no bridges. He could not retreat.\r\n\u201CI told you, old friend,\u201D Sadeas said, voice soft but distinct, overlapping the distant screams. \u201CI said that honor of yours would get you killed someday.\u201D He shook his head.\r\nThen he turned his horse, trotting it away from the battlefield.\r\nDalinar cut down a Parshendi warpair. There was always another to replace it. He set his jaw, falling into Windstance and taking the defensive, holding his little rise in the hillside and acting as a rock over which the oncoming Parshendi wave would have to break.\r\nSadeas had planned this retreat well. His men hadn\u2019t been having trouble; they\u2019d been ordered to fight in a way that they could easily disengage. And he had a full forty bridges to retreat across. Together, that made his abandonment of Dalinar happen quickly, by the scale of battles. Though Dalinar had immediately ordered his men to push forward, hoping to catch Sadeas while the bridges were still set, he hadn\u2019t been nearly quick enough. Sadeas\u2019s bridges were pulling away, the entirety of his army now across.\r\nAdolin fought nearby. They were two tired men in Plate facing an entire army. Their armor had accumulated a frightening number of cracks. None were critical yet, but they did leak precious Stormlight. Wisps of it rose like the songs of dying Parshendi.\r\n\u201CI warned you not to trust him!\u201D Adolin bellowed as he fought, cutting down a pair of Parshendi, then taking a wave of arrows from a team of archers who had set up nearby. The arrows sprayed against Adolin\u2019s armor, scratching the paint. One caught in a crack, widening it.\r\n\u201CI told you,\u201D Adolin continued to yell, lowering his arm from his face and slicing into the next pair of Parshendi just before they landed their hammers on him. \u201CI said he was an eel!\u201D\r\n\u201CI know!\u201D Dalinar yelled back.\r\n\u201CWe walked right into this,\u201D Adolin continued, shouting as if he hadn\u2019t heard Dalinar. \u201CWe let him take away our bridges. We let him get us onto the plateau before the second wave of Parshendi arrived. We let him control the scouts. We even\r\nsuggestedthe attack pattern that would leave us surrounded if he didn\u2019t support us!\u201D\r\n\u201CI know.\u201D Dalinar\u2019s heart twisted inside of him.\r\nSadeas was carrying out a premeditated, carefully planned, and very thorough betrayal. Sadeas hadn\u2019t been overwhelmed, hadn\u2019t retreated for safety\u2014though that was undoubtedly what he would claim when he got back to camp. A disaster, he\u2019d say. Parshendi everywhere. Attacking together had upset the balance, and\u2014unfortunately\u2014he\u2019d been forced to pull out and leave his friend. Oh, perhaps some of Sadeas\u2019s men would talk, tell the truth, and other highprinces would undoubtedly know what really happened. But nobody would challenge Sadeas openly. Not after such a decisive and powerful maneuver.\r\nThe people in the warcamps would go along with it. The other highprinces were too displeased with Dalinar to raise a fuss. The only one who might speak up was Elhokar, and Sadeas had his ear. It wrenched Dalinar\u2019s heart. Had it all been an act? Could he really have misjudged Sadeas so completely? What of the investigation clearing Dalinar? What of their plans and reminiscences? All lies?\r\nI saved your life, Sadeas.Dalinar watched Sadeas\u2019s banner retreat across the staging plateau. Among that distant group, a rider who wore crimson Shardplate turned and looked back. Sadeas, watching Dalinar fighting for his life. That figure paused for a moment, then turned around and rode on.\r\nThe Parshendi were surrounding the forward position where Dalinar and Adolin fought just ahead of the army. They were overwhelming his guard. He jumped down and slew another pair of enemies, but earned another blow to his forearm in the process. The Parshendi swarmed around him, and Dalinar\u2019s guard began to buckle.\r\n\u201CPull away!\u201D he yelled at Adolin, then began to back toward the army proper.\r\nThe youth cursed, but did as ordered. Dalinar and Adolin retreated back behind the front line of defense. Dalinar pulled off his cracked helm, panting. He\u2019d been fighting nonstop long enough to get winded, despite his Shardplate. He let one of the guardsmen hand him a waterskin, and Adolin did the same. Dalinar squirted the warm water into his mouth and across his face. It had the metallic taste of stormwater.\r\nAdolin lowered his waterskin, swishing the water in his mouth. He met Dalinar\u2019s eyes, his face haunted and grim. He knew. Just as Dalinar did. Just as the men likely did. There would be no surviving this battle. The Parshendi left no survivors. Dalinar braced himself, waiting for further accusations from Adolin. The boy had been right all along. And whatever the visions were, they had misled Dalinar in at least one respect. Trusting Sadeas had brought them to doom.\r\nMen died just a short distance away, screaming and cursing. Dalinar longed to fight, but he needed to rest himself. Losing a Shardbearer because of fatigue would not serve his men.\r\n\u201CWell?\u201D Dalinar demanded of Adolin. \u201CSay it. I have led us to destruction.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CThis is\r\nmyfault,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CI should never have risked our house for those foolish dreams.\u201D\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D Adolin said. He sounded surprised at himself for saying it. \u201CNo, Father. It\u2019s not your fault.\u201D\r\nDalinar stared at his son. That was not what he\u2019d expected to hear.\r\n\u201CWhat would you have done differently?\u201D Adolin asked. \u201CWould you stop trying to make something better of Alethkar? Would you become like Sadeas and the others? No. I wouldn\u2019t have you become that man, Father, regardless of what it would gain us. I wish to the Heralds that we hadn\u2019t let Sadeas trick us into this, but I will not blame you for his deceit.\u201D\r\nAdolin reached over, gripping Dalinar\u2019s Plate-covered arm. \u201CYou are right to follow the Codes. You were right to try to unite Alethkar. And I was a fool for fighting you on it every step along the path. Perhaps if I hadn\u2019t spent so much time distracting you, we would have seen this day coming.\u201D\r\nDalinar blinked, dumbfounded. This was\r\nAdolinspeaking those words? What had changed in the boy? And why did he speak these words now, at the dawn of Dalinar\u2019s greatest failure?\r\nAnd yet, as the words hung in the air, Dalinar felt his guilt evaporating, blown away by the screams of the dying. It\r\nwasa selfish emotion.\r\nWould he have had himself change? Yes, he could have been more cautious. He could have been warier of Sadeas. But would he have given up on the Codes? Would he have become the same pitiless killer he\u2019d been as a youth?\r\nNo.\r\nDid it matter that the visions had been wrong about Sadeas? Was he ashamed of the man that they, and the readings from the book, had made him become? The final piece fell into place inside of him, the final cornerstone, and he found that he was no longer worried. The confusion was gone. He knew what to do, at long last. No more questions. No more uncertainty.\r\nHe reached up, gripping Adolin\u2019s arm. \u201CThank you.\u201D\r\nAdolin nodded curtly. He was still angry, Dalinar could see, but he chose to follow Dalinar\u2014and part of following a leader was supporting him even when the battle turned against him.\r\nThen they released one another and Dalinar turned to the soldiers around them. \u201CIt is time for us to fight,\u201D he said, voice growing louder. \u201CAnd we do so not because we seek the glory of men, but because the other options are worse. We follow the Codes not because they bring gain, but because we loathe the people we would otherwise become. We stand here on this battlefield alone because of who we are.\u201D\r\nThe members of the Cobalt Guard standing in a ring began to turn, one at a time, looking toward him. Beyond them, reserve soldiers\u2014lighteyed and dark\u2014gathered closer, eyes terrified, but faces resolute.\r\n\u201CDeath is the end of all men!\u201D Dalinar bellowed. \u201CWhat is the measure of him once he is gone? The wealth he accumulated and left for his heirs to squabble over? The glory he obtained, only to be passed on to those who slew him? The lofty positions he held through happenstance?\r\n\u201CNo. We fight here because we understand. The end is the same. It is the\r\npaththat separates men. When we taste that end, we will do so with our heads held high, eyes to the sun.\u201D\r\nHe held out a hand, summoning Oathbringer. \u201CI am not ashamed of what I have become,\u201D he shouted, and found it to be true. It felt so strange to be free of guilt. \u201COther men may debase themselves to destroy me. Let them have their glory. For I will retain mine!\u201D\r\nThe Shardblade formed, dropping into his hand.\r\nThe men did not cheer, but they\r\ndidstand taller, straight-backed. A little of the terror retreated. Adolin shoved his helm on, his own Blade appearing in his hand, coated in condensation. He nodded.\r\nTogether they charged back into the battle.\r\nAnd so I die,Dalinar thought, crashing into the Parshendi ranks. There he found peace. An unexpected emotion on the field of battle, but all the more welcome for that.\r\nHe did, however, discover one regret: He was leaving poor Renarin as Kholin highprince, in over his head and surrounded by enemies grown fat on the flesh of his father and brother.\r\nI never did deliver that Shardplate I promised him,Dalinar thought.\r\nHe will have to make his way without it. Honor of our ancestors protect you, son.\r\nStay strong\u2014and learn wisdom more quickly than your father did.\r\nFarewell."

      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\n\u201CLet me no longer hurt! Let me no longer weep! Daigonarthis! The Black Fisher holds my sorrow and consumes it!\u201D\r\n\u2014Tanatesach 1173, 28 seconds pre-death. A darkeyed female street juggler. Note similarity to sample 1172-89.\r\nBridge Four lagged behind the rest of the army. With two wounded and four men needed to carry them, the bridge weighed them down. Fortunately, Sadeas had brought nearly every bridge crew on this run, including eight to lend to Dalinar. That meant the army didn\u2019t need to wait for Kaladin\u2019s team in order to cross.\r\nExhaustion saturated Kaladin, and the bridge on his shoulders seemed made of stone. He hadn\u2019t felt so tired since his first days as a bridgeman. Syl hovered in front of him, watching with concern as he marched at the head of his men, sweat drenching the sides of his face, struggling over the uneven ground of the plateau.\r\nAhead, the last of Sadeas\u2019s army was bunched along the chasm, crossing. The staging plateau was nearly empty. The sheer awful audacity of what Sadeas had done twisted at Kaladin\u2019s insides. He thought what had been done to him had been horrible. But here, Sadeas callously condemned thousands of men, lighteyed and dark. Supposed allies. That betrayal seemed to weigh as heavy on Kaladin as the bridge itself. It pressed on him, made him gasp for breath.\r\nWas there no hope for men? They killed those they should have loved. What good was it to fight, what good was it to win, if there was no difference between ally and enemy? What was victory? Meaningless. What did the deaths of Kaladin\u2019s friends and colleagues mean? Nothing. The entire world was a pustule, sickeningly green and infested with corruption.\r\nNumb, Kaladin and the others reached the chasm, though they were too late to help with the transfer. The men he\u2019d sent ahead were there, Teft looking grim, Skar leaning on a spear to support his wounded leg. A small group of dead spearmen lay nearby. Sadeas\u2019s soldiers retrieved their wounded, when possible, but some died as they were helped along. They\u2019d abandoned some of those here; Sadeas was obviously in a hurry to leave the scene.\r\nThe dead had been left with their equipment. Skar had probably gotten his crutch there. Some poor bridge crew would have to cross all the way back here at a later date to salvage from these, and from Dalinar\u2019s fallen.\r\nThey set their bridge down, and Kaladin wiped his brow. \u201CDon\u2019t place the bridge across the chasm,\u201D he told the men. \u201CWe\u2019ll wait until the last of the soldiers have crossed, then carry it over on one of the other bridges.\u201D Matal eyed Kaladin and his team, but didn\u2019t order them to set their bridge. He realized that by the time they got it into position, they\u2019d have to pull it up again.\r\n\u201CIsn\u2019t that a sight?\u201D Moash said, stepping up beside Kaladin, looking back.\r\nKaladin turned. The Tower rose behind them, sloped in their direction. Kholin\u2019s army was a circle of blue, trapped in the middle of the slope after trying to push down and get to Sadeas before he left. The Parshendi were a dark swarm with specks of red from their marbled skins. They pressed at the Alethi ring, compressing it.\r\n\u201CSuch a shame,\u201D Drehy said from beside their bridge, sitting on its lip. \u201CMakes me sick.\u201D\r\nOther bridgemen nodded, and Kaladin was surprised to see the concern in their faces. Rock and Teft joined Kaladin and Moash, all wearing their Parshendi-carapace armor. He was glad they\u2019d left Shen back in the camp. He\u2019d have been catatonic at the sight of it all.\r\nTeft cradled his wounded arm. Rock raised a hand to shade his eyes and shook his head, looking eastward. \u201CIs a shame. A shame to Sadeas. A shame to us.\u201D\r\n\u201CBridge Four,\u201D Matal called. \u201CCome on!\u201D\r\nMatal was waving for them to cross Bridge Six\u2019s bridge and leave the staging plateau. An idea came to Kaladin suddenly. A fantastic idea, like a blooming rockbud in his mind.\r\n\u201CWe\u2019ll follow with our own bridge, Matal,\u201D Kaladin called. \u201CWe only just got to the chasm. We need to sit for a few minutes.\u201D\r\n\u201CCross now!\u201D Matal yelled.\r\n\u201CWe\u2019ll just fall further behind!\u201D Kaladin retorted. \u201CYou want to explain to Sadeas why he has to hold the entire army for one miserable bridge crew? We\u2019ve got our bridge. Let my men rest. We\u2019ll catch up to you later.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd if those savages come after you?\u201D Matal demanded.\r\nKaladin shrugged.\r\nMatal blinked, then seemed to realize how badly he wanted that to happen. \u201CSuit yourself,\u201D he called, rushing across bridge six as the other bridges were pulled up. In seconds, Kaladin\u2019s team was alone beside the chasm, the army retreating westward.\r\nKaladin smiled broadly. \u201CI can\u2019t believe it, after all that worrying\u2026 Men, we\u2019re free!\u201D\r\nThe others turned to him, confused.\r\n\u201CWe\u2019ll follow in a short while,\u201D Kaladin said eagerly, \u201Cand Matal will assume we\u2019re coming. We fall farther and farther behind the army, until we\u2019re out of sight. Then we\u2019ll turn north, use the bridge to cross the Plains. We can escape northward, and everyone will just assume the Parshendi caught us and slaughtered us!\u201D\r\nThe other bridgemen regarded him with wide eyes.\r\n\u201CSupplies,\u201D Teft said.\r\n\u201CWe have these spheres,\u201D Kaladin said, pulling out his pouch. \u201CA wealth of them, right here. We can take the armor and weapons from the dead over there and use those to defend ourselves from bandits. It will be hard, but we\r\nwon\u2019t be chased!\u201D\r\nThe men were starting to grow excited. However, something gave Kaladin pause.\r\nWhat of the wounded bridgemen back in the camp?\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll have to stay behind,\u201D Kaladin said.\r\n\u201C\r\nWhat?\u201D Moash demanded.\r\n\u201CSomeone will need to,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CFor the good of our wounded in camp. We can\u2019t abandon them. And if I stay behind, I can support the story. Wound me and leave me on one of the plateaus. Sadeas is\r\nsureto send scavengers back. I\u2019ll tell them my crew was hunted down in retribution for desecrating the Parshendi corpses, our bridge tossed into the chasm. They\u2019ll believe it; they\u2019ve seen how the Parshendi hate us.\u201D\r\nThe crew was all standing now, shooting glances at one another. Uncomfortable glances.\r\n\u201CWe\u2019re not leaving without you,\u201D Sigzil said. Many of the others nodded.\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll follow,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CWe can\u2019t leave those men behind.\u201D\r\n\u201CKaladin, lad\u2014\u201D Teft began.\r\n\u201CWe can talk about me later,\u201D Kaladin interrupted. \u201CMaybe I\u2019ll go with you, then sneak back into camp later to rescue the wounded. For now, go salvage from those bodies.\u201D\r\nThey hesitated.\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s an order, men!\u201D\r\nThey moved, offering no further complaint, rushing to pilfer from the corpses Sadeas had abandoned. That left Kaladin alone beside the bridge.\r\nHe was still unsettled. It wasn\u2019t just the wounded back in camp. What was it, then? This was a fantastic opportunity. The type he\u2019d have practically killed to get during his years as a slave. The chance to vanish, presumed dead? The bridgemen wouldn\u2019t have to fight. They were free. Why, then, was he so anxious?\r\nKaladin turned to survey his men, and was shocked to see someone standing beside him. A woman of translucent white light.\r\nIt was Syl, as he\u2019d never seen her before, the size of a regular person, hands clasped in front of her, hair and dress streaming to the side in the wind. He\u2019d had no idea she could make herself so large. She stared eastward, her expression horrified, eyes wide and sorrowful. It was the face of a child watching a brutal murder that stole her innocence.\r\nKaladin turned and slowly looked in the direction she was staring. Toward the Tower.\r\nToward Dalinar Kholin\u2019s desperate army.\r\nThe sight of them twisted his heart. They fought so hopelessly. Surrounded. Abandoned. Left alone to die.\r\nWe have a bridge,Kaladin realized.\r\nIf we could get it set\u2026Most of the Parshendi were focused on the Alethi army, with only a token reserve force down at the base near the chasm. It was a small enough group that perhaps the bridgemen could contain them.\r\nBut no. That was idiocy. There were thousands of Parshendi soldiers blocking Kholin\u2019s path to the chasm. And how would the bridgemen set their bridge, with no archers to support them?\r\nSeveral of the bridgemen returned from their quick scavenge. Rock joined Kaladin, staring eastward, expression becoming grim. \u201CThis thing is terrible,\u201D he said. \u201CCan we not do something to help?\u201D\r\nKaladin shook his head. \u201CIt would be suicide, Rock. We\u2019d have to run a full assault without an army to support us.\u201D\r\n\u201CCouldn\u2019t we just go back a little of the way?\u201D Skar asked. \u201CWait to see if Kholin can cut his way down to us? If he does, then we could set our bridge.\u201D\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CIf we stayed out of range, Kholin would assume us to be scouts left by Sadeas. We\u2019ll have to charge the chasm. Otherwise he\u2019d never come down to meet us.\u201D\r\nThat made the bridgemen pale.\r\n\u201CBesides,\u201D Kaladin added. \u201CIf we did somehow save some of those men, they\u2019d talk, and Sadeas would know we still live. He\u2019d hunt us down and kill us. By going back, we\u2019d throw away our chance at freedom.\u201D\r\nThe other bridgemen nodded at that. The rest had gathered, carrying weapons. It was time to go. Kaladin tried to squelch the feeling of despair inside him. This Dalinar Kholin was probably just like the others. Like Roshone, like Sadeas, like any number of other lighteyes. Pretending virtue but corrupted inside.\r\nBut he has thousands of darkeyed soldiers with him,a part of him thought.\r\nMen who don\u2019t deserve this terrible fate. Men like my old spear crew.\r\n\u201CWe owe them nothing,\u201D Kaladin whispered. He thought could see Dalinar Kholin\u2019s banner, flying blue at the front of his army. \u201CYou got them into this, Kholin. I won\u2019t let my men die for you.\u201D He turned his back on the Tower.\r\nSyl still stood beside him, facing eastward. It made his very soul twist in knots to see that look of despair on her face. \u201CAre windspren attracted to wind,\u201D she asked softly, \u201Cor do they make it?\u201D\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CDoes it matter?\u201D\r\n\u201CPerhaps not. You see, I\u2019ve remembered what kind of spren I am.\u201D\r\n\u201CIs this the time for it, Syl?\u201D\r\n\u201CI bind things, Kaladin,\u201D she said, turning and meeting his eyes. \u201CI am honorspren. Spirit of oaths. Of promises. And of nobility.\u201D\r\nKaladin could faintly hear the sounds of the battle. Or was that just his mind, searching for something he knew to be there?\r\nCould he hear the men dying?\r\nCould he see the soldiers running away, scattering, leaving their warlord alone?\r\nEveryone else fleeing. Kaladin kneeling over Dallet\u2019s body.\r\nA green-and-burgundy banner, flying alone on the field.\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve been here before!\u201D Kaladin bellowed, turning back toward that blue banner.\r\nDalinar always fought at the front.\r\n\u201CWhat happened last time?\u201D Kaladin yelled. \u201CI\u2019ve learned! I won\u2019t be a fool again!\u201D\r\nIt seemed to crush him. Sadeas\u2019s betrayal, his exhaustion, the deaths of so many. He was there again for a moment, kneeling in Amaram\u2019s mobile headquarters, watching the last of his friends being slaughtered, too weak and hurt to save them.\r\nHe raised a trembling hand to his head, feeling the brand there, wet with his sweat. \u201CI owe you nothing, Kholin.\u201D\r\nAnd his father\u2019s voice seemed to whisper a reply.\r\nSomebody has to start, son. Somebody has to step forward and do what is right,because\r\nit is right. If nobody starts, then others cannot follow.\r\nDalinar had come to help Kaladin\u2019s men, attacking those archers and saving Bridge Four.\r\nThe lighteyes don\u2019t care about life,Lirin had said.\r\nSo I must. So we must.\r\nSo you must\u2026.\r\nLife before death.\r\nI\u2019ve failed so often. I\u2019ve been knocked to the ground and trod upon.\r\nStrength before weakness.\r\nThis would be death I\u2019d lead my friends to\u2026\r\nJourney before destination.\r\n\u2026death, and what is right.\r\n\u201CWe have to go back,\u201D Kaladin said softly. \u201CStorm it, we\r\nhaveto go back.\u201D\r\nHe turned to the members of Bridge Four. One by one, they nodded. Men who had been the dregs of the army just months before\u2014men who had once cared for nothing but their own skins\u2014took deep breaths, tossed away thoughts for their own safety, and nodded. They would follow him.\r\nKaladin looked up and sucked in a deep breath. Stormlight rushed into him like a wave, as if he\u2019d put his lips up to a highstorm and drawn it into himself.\r\n\u201CBridge up!\u201D he commanded.\r\nThe members of Bridge Four cheered their agreement, grabbing their bridge and hoisting it high. Kaladin pulled on a shield, grabbing the straps in his hand.\r\nThen he turned, raising it high. With a shout, he led his men in a charge back toward that abandoned blue banner.\r\nDalinar\u2019s Plate leaked Stormlight from dozens of small breaks; no major piece had escaped. Light rose above him like steam from a cauldron, lingering as Stormlight did, slowly diffusing.\r\nThe sun beat down upon him, baking him as he fought. He was so tired. It hadn\u2019t been long since Sadeas\u2019s betrayal, not as time was counted in battles. But Dalinar had pushed himself hard, staying at the very front, fighting side by side with Adolin. His Plate had lost much Stormlight. It was growing heavier, and lent him less power with each swing. Soon it would weigh him down, slowing him so the Parshendi could swarm over him.\r\nHe\u2019d killed many of them. So many. A frightening number, and he did it without the Thrill. He was hollow inside. Better that than pleasure.\r\nHe hadn\u2019t killed nearly enough of them. They focused on Dalinar and Adolin; with Shardbearers on the front line, any breach would soon be patched by a man in gleaming armor and a deadly Blade. The Parshendi had to bring him and Adolin down first. They knew it. Dalinar knew it. Adolin knew it.\r\nStories spoke of battlefields where the Shardbearers were the last ones standing, pulled down by their enemies after long, heroic fights. Completely unrealistic. If you killed the Shardbearers first, you could take their Blades and turn them against the enemy.\r\nHe swung again, muscles lagging with fatigue. Dying first. It was a good place to be.\r\nAsk nothing of them you wouldn\u2019t do yourself\u2026.Dalinar stumbled on the rocks, his Shardplate feeling as heavy as regular armor.\r\nHe could be satisfied with the way he\u2019d handled his own life. But his men\u2026 he had failed them. Thinking of the way he had stupidly led then into a trap, that sickened him.\r\nAnd then there was Navani.\r\nOf all the times to finally begin courting her,Dalinar thought.\r\nSix years wasted. A lifetime wasted. And now she\u2019ll have to grieve again.\r\nThat thought made him raise his arms and steady his feet on the stone. He fought off the Parshendi. Struggling on. For her. He would not let himself fall while he still had strength.\r\nNearby, Adolin\u2019s armor leaked as well. The youth was extending himself more and more to protect his father. There had been no discussion of trying, perhaps, to leap the chasms and flee. With chasms so wide, the chances were slim\u2014but beyond that, they would not abandon their men to die. He and Adolin had lived by the Codes. They would die by the Codes.\r\nDalinar swung again, staying at Adolin\u2019s side, fighting in that just-out-of-reach tandem way of two Shardbearers. Sweat streamed down his face inside his helm, and he shot a final glance toward the disappearing army. It was just barely visible on the horizon. Dalinar\u2019s current position gave him a good view down to the west.\r\nLet that man be cursed for\u2026\r\nFor\u2026\r\nBlood of my fathers, what isthat\r\n?\r\nA small force was moving across the western plateau, running toward the Tower. A solitary bridge crew, carrying their bridge.\r\n\u201CIt can\u2019t be,\u201D Dalinar said, stepping back from the fighting, letting the Cobalt Guard\u2014what was left of them\u2014rush in to defend him. Distrusting his eyes, he pushed his visor up. The rest of Sadeas\u2019s army was gone, but this single bridge crew remained. Why?\r\n\u201CAdolin!\u201D he bellowed, pointing with his Shardblade, a surge of hope flooding his limbs.\r\nThe young man turned, tracing Dalinar\u2019s gesture. Adolin froze. \u201CImpossible!\u201D he yelled. \u201CWhat kind of trap is that?\u201D\r\n\u201CA foolish one, if it is a trap. We are already dead.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut why would he send one back? What purpose?\u201D\r\n\u201CDoes it matter?\u201D\r\nThey hesitated for a moment amid the battle. Both knew the answer.\r\n\u201CAssault formations!\u201D Dalinar yelled, turning back to his troops. Stormfather, there were so few of them left. Less than half of his original eight thousand.\r\n\u201CForm up,\u201D Adolin called. \u201CGet ready to move! We\u2019re going to punch through them, men. Gather everything you\u2019ve got. We\u2019ve got one chance!\u201D\r\nA slim one,Dalinar thought, pulling his visor down.\r\nWe\u2019ll have to cut through the rest of the Parshendi army.Even if they reached the bottom, they\u2019d probably find the crew dead, their bridge cast into the chasm. The Parshendi archers were already forming up; there were more than a hundred of them. It would be a slaughter.\r\nBut it was a hope. A tiny, precious hope. If his army was going to fall, it would do so while trying to seize that hope.\r\nRaising his Shardblade high, feeling a surge of strength and determination, Dalinar charged forward at the head of his men.\r\nFor the second time in one day, Kaladin ran toward an armed Parshendi position, shield before him, wearing armor cut from the corpse of a fallen enemy. Perhaps he should have felt revolted at what he\u2019d done in creating his armor. But it was no worse than what the Parshendi had done in killing Dunny, Maps, and that nameless man who had shown Kaladin kindness on his first day as a bridgemen. Kaladin still wore that man\u2019s sandals.\r\nUs and them,he thought. That was the only way a soldier could think of it. For today, Dalinar Kholin and his men were part of the \u201Cus.\u201D\r\nA group of Parshendi had seen the bridgemen approaching and was setting up with bows. Fortunately, it appeared that Dalinar had seen Kaladin\u2019s band as well, for the army in blue was beginning to cut its way toward rescue.\r\nIt wasn\u2019t going to work. There were too many Parshendi, and Dalinar\u2019s men would be tired. It was another disaster. But for once, Kaladin charged into it with eyes wide open.\r\nThis is my choice,he thought as the Parshendi archers formed up.\r\nIt\u2019s not some angry god watching me, not some spren playing tricks, not some twist of fate.\r\nIt\u2019s me. Ichose\r\nto follow Tien. Ichose\r\nto charge the Shardbearer and save Amaram. Ichose\r\nto escape the slave pits. And now, Ichoose\r\nto try to rescue these men, though I know I will probably fail.\r\nThe Parshendi loosed their arrows, and Kaladin felt an exaltation. Tiredness evaporated, fatigue fled. He wasn\u2019t fighting for Sadeas. He wasn\u2019t working to line someone\u2019s pockets. He was fighting to protect.\r\nThe arrows zipped at him and he swung his shield in an arc, spraying them away. Others came, shooting this way and that, seeking his flesh. He stayed just ahead of them, leaping as they shot for his thighs, turning as they shot for his shoulders, raising his shield when they shot for his face. It wasn\u2019t easy, and more than a few arrows got close to him, scoring his breastplate or shin guards. But none hit. He was doing it. He was\u2014\r\nSomething was wrong.\r\nHe spun between two arrows, confused.\r\n\u201CKaladin!\u201D Syl said, hovering nearby, back to her smaller form. \u201CThere!\u201D\r\nShe pointed toward the other staging plateau, the one nearby that Dalinar had used for his assault. A large contingent of Parshendi had jumped across to that plateau and were kneeling down, raising bows. Pointed not at him, but right at Bridge Four\u2019s unshielded flank.\r\n\u201CNo!\u201D Kaladin screamed, Stormlight escaping from his mouth in a cloud. He turned and ran back across the rocky plateau toward the bridge crew. Arrows launched at him from behind. One took his backplate square on, but skidded aside. Another hit his helm. He leaped over a rocky rift, dashing with all the speed his Stormlight could lend him.\r\nThe Parshendi at the side were drawing. There were at least fifty of them. He was going to be too late. He was going to\u2014\r\n\u201CBridge Four!\u201D he bellowed. \u201CSide carry right!\u201D\r\nThey hadn\u2019t practiced that maneuver in weeks, but their training was manifest as they obeyed without question, dropping the bridge to their side just as the archers loosed. The flight of arrows hit the bridge\u2019s deck, bristling across the wood. Kaladin let out a relieved breath, reaching the bridge team, who had slowed to carry the bridge on the side.\r\n\u201CKaladin!\u201D Rock said, pointing.\r\nKaladin spun. The archers behind, on the Tower, were drawing for a large volley.\r\nThe bridge crew was exposed. The archers loosed.\r\nHe yelled again, screaming out, Stormlight infusing the air around him as he threw every bit of it he had into his shield. The scream echoed in his ears; the Stormlight burst from him, his clothing freezing and cracking.\r\nArrows darkened the sky. Something\r\nhithim, an extended impact that tossed him backward into the bridgemen. He struck hard, grunting as the force continued to push upon him.\r\nThe bridge ground to a halt, the men stopping.\r\nAll fell still.\r\nKaladin blinked, feeling completely drained. His body hurt, his arms tingled, his back ached. There was a sharp pain in his wrist. He groaned, opening his eyes, stumbling as Rock\u2019s hands caught him from behind.\r\nA muted thump. The bridge being set down.\r\nIdiots!Kaladin thought.\r\nDon\u2019t set it down\u2026. Retreat\u2026.\r\nThe bridgemen crowded around him as he slipped to the ground, overwhelmed by having expended too much Stormlight. He blinked at what he held before him, attached to his bleeding arm.\r\nHis shield was\r\ncoveredin arrows, dozens of them, some splitting the others. The bones crossing the shield\u2019s front had shattered; the wood was in splinters. Some of the arrows had gone through and hit his forearm. That was the pain.\r\nOver a hundred arrows. An entire volley. Pulled into a single shield.\r\n\u201CBy the Brightcaller\u2019s rays,\u201D Drehy said softly. \u201CWhat\u2026 what was\u2026\u201D\r\n\u201CIt was like a fountain of light,\u201D Moash said, kneeling beside Kaladin. \u201CLike the sun itself burst from you, Kaladin.\u201D\r\n\u201CThe Parshendi\u2026\u201D Kaladin croaked, and let go of the shield. The straps were broken, and as he struggled to stand, the shield all but disintegrated, falling to pieces, scattering dozens of broken arrows at his feet. A few remained stuck in his arm, but he ignored the pain, looking across at the Parshendi.\r\nThe groups of archers on both plateaus froze in stunned postures. The ones in front began to call to one another in a language Kaladin didn\u2019t understand. \u201CNeshua Kadal!\u201D They stood up.\r\nAnd then they fled.\r\n\u201CWhat?\u201D Kaladin said.\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know,\u201D Teft said, cradling his own wounded arm. \u201CBut we\u2019re getting you to safety. Blast this arm. Lopen!\u201D\r\nThe shorter man brought Dabbid, and they ushered Kaladin away to a more secure location toward the center of the plateau. He held his arm, numb, his exhaustion so deep that he could barely think.\r\n\u201CBridge up!\u201D Moash called. \u201CWe\u2019ve still got a job to do!\u201D\r\nThe rest of the bridgemen grimly ran back to their bridge, hoisting it up. On the Tower, Dalinar\u2019s force was fighting its way through the Parshendi toward the possible safety of the bridge crew.\r\nThey must be taking such heavy losses\u2026Kaladin thought numbly.\r\nHe stumbled and fell to the ground; Teft and Lopen pulled Kaladin into a sheltered hollow, joining Skar and Dabbid. Skar\u2019s foot bandage reddened with seeping blood, the spear he\u2019d been using as a staff resting beside him.\r\nThought I told him\u2026 to stay off that foot\u2026.\r\n\u201CWe need spheres,\u201D Teft said. \u201CSkar?\u201D\r\n\u201CHe asked for them this morning,\u201D the lean man said. \u201CGave him everything I had. I think most of the men did the same.\u201D\r\nTeft cursed softly, pulling the remaining arrows from Kaladin\u2019s arm, then wrapping it with bandages.\r\n\u201CIs he going to be all right?\u201D Skar asked.\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know,\u201D Teft said. \u201CI don\u2019t know anything. Kelek! I\u2019m an idiot. Kaladin. Lad, can you hear me?\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s\u2026 just shock\u2026\u201D Kaladin said.\r\n\u201CYou\u2019re looking strange, gancho,\u201D Lopen said nervously. \u201CWhite.\u201D\r\n\u201CYour skin is ashen, lad,\u201D Teft said. \u201CIt looks like you did something to yourself back there. I don\u2019t know\u2026 I\u2026\u201D He cursed again, smacking his hand against the stone. \u201CI should have listened. Idiot!\u201D\r\nThey\u2019d laid him on his side, and he could barely see the Tower. New groups of Parshendi\u2014ones who hadn\u2019t seen Kaladin\u2019s display\u2014were making for the chasm, bearing weapons. Bridge Four arrived and set down their bridge. They unstrapped their shields and hurriedly retrieved spears from the sacks of salvage tied at the bridge\u2019s side. Then the men went to their positions pushing at the sides, preparing to slide the bridge across the gap.\r\nThe Parshendi teams didn\u2019t have bows. They formed up to wait, weapons out. There were easily three times as many as there were bridgemen, and more were coming.\r\n\u201CWe\u2019ve got to go help,\u201D Skar said to Lopen and Teft.\r\nThe other two nodded, and all three\u2014two wounded and one missing an arm\u2014climbed to their feet. Kaladin tried to do likewise, but he fell back down, legs too weak to hold him.\r\n\u201CStay, lad,\u201D Teft said, smiling. \u201CWe\u2019ll handle it just fine.\u201D They gathered some spears from a stock Lopen had put in his litter, then hobbled out to join the bridge crew. Even Dabbid joined them. He hadn\u2019t spoken since being wounded on that first bridge run, so long ago.\r\nKaladin crawled up to the lip of the depression, watching them. Syl landed on the stone beside him. \u201CStorming fools,\u201D Kaladin muttered. \u201CShouldn\u2019t have followed me. Proud of them anyway.\u201D\r\n\u201CKaladin\u2026\u201D Syl said.\r\n\u201CIs there anything you can do?\u201D He was so\r\nstormingtired. \u201CSomething to make me stronger?\u201D\r\nShe shook her head.\r\nA short distance ahead, the bridgemen began to push. The bridge\u2019s wood scraped loudly as it crossed the rocks, moving out over the chasm toward the waiting Parshendi. They began singing that harsh battle song, the one they did whenever they saw Kaladin in his armor.\r\nThe Parshendi looked eager, angry, deadly. They wanted blood. They would cut into the bridgemen and rip them apart, then drop the bridge\u2014 and their corpses\u2014into the void beneath.\r\nIt\u2019s happening again,Kaladin thought, dazed and overwhelmed. He found himself curling up, drained and shaken.\r\nI can\u2019t get to them. They\u2019ll die. Right before me. Tukks. Dead. Nelda. Dead. Goshel. Dead. Dallet. Cenn. Maps. Dunny. Dead. Dead. Dead\u2026\r\nTien.\r\nDead.\r\nLying huddled in a hollow in the rock. The sounds of battle ringing in the distance. Death surrounding him.\r\nIn a moment, he was there again, on that most horrible of days.\r\nKaladin stumbled through the cursing, screaming, fighting chaos of war, clinging to his spear. He\u2019d dropped his shield. He needed to find a shield somewhere. Shouldn\u2019t he have a shield?\r\nIt was his third real battle. He\u2019d been in Amaram\u2019s army only a few months, but already Hearthstone seemed a world away. He reached a hollow of rock and crouched down, pushing his back to it, breathing in and out, fingers slick on the spear\u2019s shaft. He was shaking.\r\nHe\u2019d never realized how idyllic his life had been. Away from war. Away from death. Away from those screams, the cacophony of metal on metal, metal on wood, metal on flesh. He squeezed his eyes shut, trying to block it out.\r\nNo,he thought.\r\nOpen your eyes. Don\u2019t let them find you and kill you that easily.\r\nHe forced his eyes open, then turned and peeked out over the battlefield. It was a complete mess. They fought on a large hillside, thousands of men on either side, intermixing and killing. How could anyone keep track of anything in this insanity?\r\nAmaram\u2019s army\u2014Kaladin\u2019s army\u2014was trying to hold the hilltop. Another army, also Alethi, was trying to take it from them. That was all Kaladin knew. The enemy seemed more numerous than his own army.\r\nHe\u2019ll be safe,Kaladin thought.\r\nHe will be!\r\nBut he had trouble convincing himself. Tien\u2019s stint as a messenger boy hadn\u2019t lasted long. Recruitment was down, he\u2019d been told, and every hand that could hold a spear was needed. Tien and the other older messenger boys had been organized into several squads of deep reserves.\r\nDalar said those wouldn\u2019t ever be used. Probably. Unless the army was in serious danger. Did being surrounded atop a steep hill, their lines in chaos, constitute serious danger?\r\nGet to the top,he thought, looking up the incline. Amaram\u2019s banner still flew up there. Their soldiers must be holding. All Kaladin could see was a churning mess of men in orange and the occasional bit of forest green.\r\nKaladin took off at a run up the side of the hill. He didn\u2019t turn as men shouted at him, didn\u2019t check to see which side they were from. Patches of grass pulled down in front of him. He stumbled over a few corpses, dashed around a couple of scraggly stumpweight trees, and avoided places where men were fighting.\r\nThere,he thought, noting a group of spearmen ahead, standing in a line, watching warily. Green. Amaram\u2019s colors. Kaladin scrambled up to them, and the soldiers let him pass.\r\n\u201CWhich squad are you from, soldier?\u201D said a stocky lighteyed man with the knots of a low captain.\r\n\u201CDead, sir,\u201D Kaladin forced out. \u201CAll dead. We were in Brightlord Tashlin\u2019s company, and\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CBah,\u201D the man said, turning to a runner. \u201CThird report we\u2019ve had that Tashlin is down. Somebody warn Amaram. East side is weakening by degrees.\u201D He looked to Kaladin. \u201CYou, off to the reserves for reassignment.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes, sir,\u201D Kaladin said, numb. He glanced down the way he\u2019d come. The incline was littered with corpses, many of them in green. Even as he watched, a group of three stragglers rushing for the top was intercepted and slaughtered.\r\nNone of the men at the top moved to help them. Kaladin could have fallen just as easily, within yards of safety. He knew that it was probably important, strategically, that these soldiers in the line maintain their positions. But it seemed so heartless.\r\nFind Tien,he thought, trotting off toward the reserves field on the north side of the wide hilltop. Here, however, he found only more chaos. Groups of dazed men, bloodied, getting sorted into new squads and sent back out onto the field. Kaladin moved through them, searching for the squad that had been created out of the messenger boys.\r\nHe found Dalar first. The lanky, three-fingered sergeant of the reserves stood beside a tall post bearing a pair of flapping triangular banners. He was assigning newly made squads to fill out losses in the companies fighting below. Kaladin could still hear the yells.\r\n\u201CYou,\u201D Dalar said, pointing at Kaladin. \u201CSquad reassignment is in that direction. Get moving!\u201D\r\n\u201CI need to find the squad made from messenger boys,\u201D Kaladin said.\r\n\u201CWhy in Damnation do you want to know that?\u201D\r\n\u201CHow should I know?\u201D Kaladin said, shrugging, trying to remain calm. \u201CI just follow orders.\u201D\r\nDalar grunted. \u201CBrightlord Sheler\u2019s company. Southeast side. You can\u2014\u201D\r\nKaladin was already running. This wasn\u2019t supposed to happen. Tien was supposed to stay safe. Stormfather. It hadn\u2019t even been\r\nfour monthsyet!\r\nHe made his way to the southeast side of the hill and searched out a banner flapping a quarter of the way down the incline. The stark black glyphpair read\r\nshesh lerel\u2014Sheler\u2019s company. Surprised at his own determination, Kaladin brushed past the soldiers guarding the hilltop and found himself on the battlefield again.\r\nThings looked better over here. Sheler\u2019s company was holding its ground, although assaulted by a wave of enemies. Kaladin dashed down the incline, skidding in places, sliding on blood. His fear had vanished. It had been replaced by worry for his brother.\r\nHe arrived at the company line just as enemy squads were assaulting. He tried to scramble farther behind the lines to search for Tien, but he was\u00A0caught in the wave of attacks. He stumbled to the side, joining a squad of spearmen.\r\nThe enemy was on them in a second. Kaladin held his spear in two hands, standing at the edge of the other spearmen and trying not to get in their way. He didn\u2019t really know what he was doing. He barely knew enough to use his shieldmate for protection. The exchange happened quickly, and Kaladin made only a single thrust. The enemy was rebuffed, and he managed to avoid taking a wound.\r\nHe stood, panting, gripping his spear.\r\n\u201CYou,\u201D an authoritative voice said. A man was pointing at Kaladin, knots at his shoulders. The squadleader. \u201CAbout time my team got some of those reinforcements. For a time there, I thought Varth was going to get every man. Where\u2019s your shield?\u201D\r\nKaladin scrambled to grab one off a fallen soldier nearby. As he was working, the squadleader swore behind him. \u201CDamnation. They\u2019re coming again. Two prongs this time. We can\u2019t hold like this.\u201D\r\nA man in a green messenger\u2019s vest scrambled over a nearby rock formation. \u201CHold against the east assault, Mesh!\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat about that wave to the south?\u201D the squadleader\u2014Mesh\u2014bellowed.\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s handled for now. Hold east! Those are your orders!\u201D The messenger scrambled on, delivering a similar message to the next squad in line. \u201CVarth. Your squad is to hold east!\u201D\r\nKaladin got up with his shield. He needed to go find Tien. He couldn\u2019t\u2014\r\nHe stumbled to a stop. There, in the next squad down the line, stood three figures. Younger boys, looking small in their armor and holding their spears uncertainly. One was Tien. His team of reserves had obviously been split apart to fill holes in other squads.\r\n\u201CTien!\u201D Kaladin screamed, falling out of line as the enemy troops came upon them. Why were Tien and the other two positioned in the\r\nmiddle frontof the squad formation? They barely knew how to hold a spear!\r\nMesh yelled after Kaladin, but Kaladin ignored him. The enemy was upon them in a moment, and Mesh\u2019s squad broke, losing their discipline and turning to a more frenzied, unorganized resistance.\r\nKaladin felt something like a thump against his leg. He stumbled, hitting the ground, and realized with shock that he\u2019d been stabbed with a spear. He felt no pain. Odd.\r\nTien!he thought, forcing himself up. Someone loomed above him, and Kaladin reacted immediately, rolling as a spear came down for his heart. His own spear was back in his hands before he realized he\u2019d grabbed it, and he whipped it upward.\r\nThen he froze. He\u2019d just driven his spear through the enemy soldier\u2019s neck. It had happened so quickly.\r\nI just killed a man.\r\nHe rolled over, letting the enemy drop to his knees as Kaladin yanked his spear free. Varth\u2019s squad was back a little farther. The enemy hit it a little while after attacking where Kaladin had been. Tien and the other two were still in the front.\r\n\u201CTien!\u201D Kaladin yelled.\r\nThe boy looked toward him, eyes opening wide. He actually smiled. Behind him, the rest of the squad pulled back. Leaving the three untrained boys exposed.\r\nAnd, sensing weakness, the enemy soldiers descended on Tien and the others. There was an armored lighteyes at their front, in gleaming steel. He swung a sword.\r\nKaladin\u2019s brother fell just like that. One eyeblink and he was standing there, looking terrified. The next he was on the ground.\r\n\u201C\r\nNo!\u201D Kaladin screamed. He tried to get to his feet, but slipped to his knees. His leg didn\u2019t work right.\r\nVarth\u2019s squad hurried forward, attacking the enemies\u2014who had been distracted with Tien and the other two. They\u2019d placed the untrained at the front to stop the momentum of the enemy attack.\r\n\u201CNo, no, no!\u201D Kaladin screamed. He used his spear to hoist himself to his feet, then stumbled forward. It couldn\u2019t be what he thought. It couldn\u2019t be over that quickly.\r\nIt was a miracle that nobody struck Kaladin down as he stumbled the rest of the distance. He barely thought about it. He just watched where Tien had fallen. There was thunder. No. Hooves. Amaram had arrived with his cavalry, and they were sweeping through the enemy lines.\r\nKaladin didn\u2019t care. He finally reached the spot. There, he found three corpses: young, small, lying in a hollow in the stone. Horrified, numb, Kaladin reached out his hand and rolled over the one that was face-down.\r\nTien\u2019s dead eyes stared upward.\r\nKaladin continued to kneel beside the body. He should have bound his wound, should have moved back to safety, but he was too numb. He just knelt.\r\n\u201CAbout time he rode down here,\u201D a voice said.\r\nKaladin looked up, noting a group of spearmen gathering nearby, watching the cavalry.\r\n\u201CHe wanted them to bunch up against us,\u201D one the spearmen said. He had knots on the shoulders. Varth, their squadleader. Such keen eyes the man had. Not a brutish lout. Lean, thoughtful.\r\nI should feel anger,Kaladin thought.\r\nI should feel\u2026 something.\r\nVarth looked down at him, then at the bodies of the three dead messenger boys.\r\n\u201CYou bastard,\u201D Kaladin hissed. \u201CYou put them in front.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou work with what you have,\u201D Varth said, nodding to his team, then pointing at a fortified position. \u201CIf they give me men who can\u2019t fight, I\u2019ll find another use for them.\u201D He hesitated as his team marched away. He seemed regretful. \u201CGotta do what you can to stay alive, son. Turn a liability into an advantage whenever you can. Remember that, if you live.\u201D\r\nWith that, he jogged off.\r\nKaladin looked down.\r\nWhy couldn\u2019t I protect him?he thought, looking at Tien, remembering his brother\u2019s laugh. His innocence, his smile, his excitement at exploring the hills outside Hearthstone.\r\nPlease. Please let me protect him. Make me strong enough.\r\nHe felt so weak. Blood loss. He found himself slumping to the side, and with tired hands, he tied off his wound. And then, feeling terribly vacant inside, he lay down beside Tien and pulled the body close.\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t worry,\u201D Kaladin whispered. When had he started to cry? \u201CI\u2019ll bring you home. I\u2019ll protect you, Tien. I\u2019ll bring you back\u2026.\u201D\r\nHe held the body into the evening, long past the end of the battle, clinging to it as it slowly grew cold.\r\nKaladin blinked. He wasn\u2019t in that hollow with Tien. He was on the plateau.\r\nHe could hear men dying in the distance.\r\nHe hated thinking of that day. He almost wished he\u2019d never gone looking for Tien. Then he wouldn\u2019t have had to watch. Wouldn\u2019t have had to kneel there, powerless, as his brother was slaughtered.\r\nIt was happening again. Rock, Moash, Teft. They were all going to die. And here he lay, powerless again. He could barely move. He felt so\r\ndrained.\r\n\u201CKaladin,\u201D a voice whispered. He blinked. Syl was hovering in front of him. \u201CDo you know the Words?\u201D\r\n\u201CAll I wanted to do was protect them,\u201D he whispered.\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve come. The Words, Kaladin.\u201D\r\n\u201CThey\u2019re going to die. I can\u2019t save them. I\u2014\u201D\r\nAmaram slaughtered his men in front of him.\r\nA nameless Shardbearer killed Dallet.\r\nA lighteyes killed Tien.\r\nNo.\r\nKaladin rolled over and forced himself to his feet, wavering on weak legs.\r\nNo!\r\nBridge Four hadn\u2019t set its bridge yet. That surprised him. They were still pushing it across the chasm, the Parshendi crowding up on the other side, eager, their song becoming more frantic. His delusions had seemed like hours, but had passed in just a few heartbeats.\r\nNO!\r\nLopen\u2019s litter was in front of Kaladin. A spear rested amid the drained water bottles and ragged bandages, steel head reflecting sunlight. It whispered to him. It terrified him, and he loved it.\r\nWhen the time comes, I hope you\u2019re ready. Because this lot will need you.\r\nHe seized the spear, the first real weapon he had held since his display in the chasm so many weeks ago. Then he started to run. Slowly at first. Picking up speed. Reckless, his body exhausted. But he did not stop. He pushed forward, harder, charging toward the bridge. It was only halfway across the chasm.\r\nSyl shot out in front of him, looking back, worried. \u201CThe\r\nWords, Kaladin!\u201D\r\nRock cried out as Kaladin ran onto the bridge as it was moving. The wood wobbled beneath him. It was out over the chasm, but hadn\u2019t reached the other side.\r\n\u201CKaladin!\u201D Teft yelled. \u201CWhat are you doing?\u201D\r\nKaladin screamed, reaching the end of the bridge. Finding a tiny surge of strength somewhere, he raised his spear and threw himself off the end of the wooden platform, launching into the air above the cavernous void.\r\nBridgemen cried out in dismay. Syl zipped about him with worry. Parshendi looked up with amazement as a lone bridgeman sailed through the air toward them.\r\nHis drained, worn-out body barely had any strength left. In that moment of crystallized time, he looked down on his enemies. Parshendi with their marbled red and black skin. Soldiers raising finely crafted weapons, as if to cut him from the sky. Strangers, oddities in carapace breastplates and skullcaps. Many of them wearing beards.\r\nBeards woven with glowing gemstones.\r\nKaladin breathed in.\r\nLike the power of salvation itself\u2014like rays of sunlight from the eyes of the Almighty\u2014Stormlight exploded from those gemstones. It streamed through the air, pulled in visible streams, like glowing columns of luminescent smoke. Twisting and turning and spiraling like tiny funnel clouds until they slammed into him.\r\nAnd the storm came to life again.\r\nKaladin hit the rocky ledge, legs suddenly strong, mind, body, and blood\r\nalivewith energy. He fell into a crouch, spear under his arm, a small ring of Stormlight expanding from him in a wave, pushed down to the stones by his fall. Stunned, the Parshendi shied away, eyes widening, song faltering.\r\nA trickle of Stormlight closed the wounds on his arm. He smiled, spear held before him. It was as familiar as the body of a lover long lost.\r\nThe Words, a voice said, urgent, as if directly into his mind. In that moment, Kaladin was amazed to realize that he knew them, though they\u2019d never been told to him.\r\n\u201CI will protect those who cannot protect themselves,\u201D he whispered.\r\nThe Second Ideal of the Knights Radiant.\r\nA\r\ncrackshook the air, like an enormous clap of thunder, though the sky was completely clear. Teft stumbled back\u2014having just set the bridge in place\u2014and found himself gaping with the rest of Bridge Four. Kaladin\r\nexplodedwith energy.\r\nA burst of whiteness washed out from him, a wave of white smoke. Stormlight. The force of it slammed into the first rank of Parshendi, tossing them backward, and Teft had to hold his hand up against the vibrancy of the light.\r\n\u201CSomething just changed,\u201D Moash whispered, hand up. \u201CSomething important.\u201D\r\nKaladin raised his spear. The powerful light began to subside, retreating. A more subdued glow began to steam off his body. Radiant, like smoke from an ethereal fire.\r\nNearby, some of the Parshendi fled, though others stepped up, raising weapons in challenge. Kaladin spun into them, a living storm of steel, wood, and determination."

      "ChapterName": "68: ESHONAI",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\n\u201CThey named it the Final Desolation, but they lied. Our gods lied. Oh, how they lied. The Everstorm comes. I hear its whispers, see its stormwall, know its heart.\u201D\r\n\u2014Tanatanes 1173, 8 seconds pre-death. An Azish itinerant worker. Sample of particular note.\r\nSoldiers in blue yelled, screaming war cries to encourage themselves. The sounds were like a roaring avalanche behind Adolin as he swung his Blade in wild swings. There was no room for a proper stance. He had to keep moving, punching through the Parshendi, leading his men toward the western chasm.\r\nHis father\u2019s horse and his own were still safe, carrying some wounded through the back ranks. The Shardbearers didn\u2019t dare mount, though. In these close quarters, the Ryshadium would be chopped down and their riders dropped.\r\nThis was the type of battlefield maneuver that would have been impossible without Shardbearers. A rush against superior numbers? Made by wounded, exhausted men? They should have been stopped cold and crushed.\r\nBut Shardbearers could not be stopped so easily. Their armor leaking Stormlight, their six-foot Blades flashing in wide swaths, Adolin and Dalinar shattered the Parshendi defenses, creating an opening, a rift. Their men\u2014the best-trained in the Alethi warcamps\u2014knew how to use it. They formed a wedge behind their Shardbearers, prying the Parshendi armies open, using spearman formations to cut through and keep going forward.\r\nAdolin moved at almost a jog. The incline of the hill worked in their favor, giving them better footing, letting them rumble down the slope like charging chulls. The chance to survive when all had been thought lost gave the men a surge of energy for one last dash toward freedom.\r\nThey took enormous casualties. Already, Dalinar\u2019s force had lost another thousand of his four, probably more. But it didn\u2019t matter. The Parshendi fought to kill, but the Alethi\u2014this time\u2014fought to live.\r\nLiving Heralds above,Teft thought, watching Kaladin fight. Just moments ago, the lad had looked near death, skin a dull grey, hands shaking. Now he was a shining whirlwind, a storm wielding a spear. Teft had known many a battlefield, but he had never seen anything remotely like this. Kaladin held the ground before the bridge by himself. White Stormlight streamed from him like a blazing fire. His speed was incredible, nearly inhuman, and his precision\u2014each thrust of the spear hit a neck, side, or other unarmored target of Parshendi flesh.\r\nIt was more than the Stormlight. Teft had only a fragmentary recollection of the things his family had tried to teach him, but those memories all agreed. Stormlight did not grant skill. It could not make a man into something he was not. It enhanced, it strengthened, it invigorated.\r\nIt perfected.\r\nKaladin ducked low, slamming the butt against the leg of a Parshendi, dropping him to the ground, and came up to block an axe swing by catching the haft with that of his spear. He let go with one hand, sweeping the tip of the spear up under the arm of the Parshendi and ramming it into his armpit. As that Parshendi fell, Kaladin pulled his spear free and slammed the end into a Parshendi head that had gotten too close. The butt of the spear shattered with a spray of wood, and the Parshendi\u2019s carapace helm exploded.\r\nNo, this wasn\u2019t just Stormlight. This was a master of the spear with his capacity enhanced to astonishing levels.\r\nThe bridgemen gathered around Teft, amazed. His wounded arm didn\u2019t seem to hurt as much as it should. \u201CHe\u2019s like a part of the wind itself,\u201D Drehy said. \u201CPulled down and given life. Not a man at all. A spren.\u201D\r\n\u201CSigzil?\u201D Skar asked, eyes wide. \u201CYou ever seen anything like this?\u201D\r\nThe dark-skinned man shook his head.\r\n\u201CStormfather,\u201D Peet whispered. \u201CWhat\u2026 what\r\nishe?\u201D\r\n\u201CHe\u2019s our bridgeleader,\u201D Teft said, snapping out of his reverie. On the other side of the chasm, Kaladin barely dodged a blow from a Parshendi mace. \u201CAnd he needs our help! First and second teams, you take the left side. Don\u2019t let the Parshendi get around him. Third and fourth teams, you\u2019re with me on the right! Rock and Lopen, you be ready to pull back any wounded. The rest of you, wrinkled wall formation. Don\u2019t attack, just stay alive and keep them back. And Lopen, toss him a spear that isn\u2019t broken!\u201D\r\nDalinar roared, striking down a group of Parshendi swordsmen. He charged over their bodies, running up a short incline and throwing himself in a leap, dropping several feet into the Parshendi below, sweeping out with his Blade. His armor was an enormous weight upon his back, but the energy of his struggle kept him going. The Cobalt Guard\u2014the straggling members who were left\u2014roared and leaped off the incline behind him.\r\nThey were doomed. Those bridgemen would be dead by now. But Dalinar blessed them for their sacrifice. It might have been meaningless as an end, but it had changed the journey.\r\nThiswas how his soldiers should fall\u2014not cornered and frightened, but fighting with passion.\r\nHe would not slide quietly into the dark. No indeed. He shouted his defiance again as he smashed into a group of Parshendi, whirling and hauling his Shardblade in a circling sweep. He stumbled through the patch of dead Parshendi, their eyes burning as they fell.\r\nAnd Dalinar burst out onto open stone.\r\nHe blinked, stunned.\r\nWe did it,he thought in disbelief.\r\nWe cut all the way through.Behind him, soldiers roared, their tired voices sounding nearly as amazed as he felt. Just ahead of him, a final group of Parshendi lay between Dalinar and the chasm. But their backs were turned to him. Why were they\u2014\r\nThe bridgemen.\r\nThe\r\nbridgemenwere fighting. Dalinar gaped, lowering Oathbringer with numb arms. That little force of bridgemen held the bridgehead, fighting desperately against the Parshendi who were trying to force them back.\r\nIt was the most amazing, most\r\ngloriousthing Dalinar had ever seen.\r\nAdolin let out a whoop, breaking through the Parshendi to Dalinar\u2019s left. The younger man\u2019s armor was scratched, cracked, and scored, and his helm had shattered, leaving his head dangerously exposed. But his face was exultant.\r\n\u201CGo, go,\u201D Dalinar bellowed, pointing. \u201CGive them support, storm it! If those bridgemen fall, we\u2019re all dead!\u201D\r\nAdolin and the Cobalt Guard dashed forward. Gallant and Sureblood, Adolin\u2019s Ryshadium, galloped past, carrying three wounded each. Dalinar hated to have left so many wounded on the slopes, but the Codes were clear. In this case, protecting the men he could save was more important.\r\nDalinar turned to strike at the main body of Parshendi to his left, making certain the corridor remained open for his troops. Many of the soldiers scrambled toward safety, though several squads proved their mettle by forming up at the sides to keep fighting, opening the gap wider. Sweat had soaked through the brow rag attached to Dalinar\u2019s helm, and drops of it fell, overwhelming his eyebrows and falling into his left eye. He cursed, reaching to open his visor\u2014then froze.\r\nThe enemy troops were parting. There, standing among them, was a seven-foot-tall giant of a Parshendi in gleaming silver Shardplate. It fit as only Plate could, having molded to his large stature. His Shardblade was wicked and barbed, like flames frozen into metal. He raised it to Dalinar in a salute.\r\n\u201CNow?\u201D Dalinar bellowed incredulously. \u201C\r\nNowyou come?\u201D\r\nThe Shardbearer stepped forward, steel boots clanking on stone. The other Parshendi backed away.\r\n\u201CWhy not earlier?\u201D Dalinar demanded, hurriedly setting himself into Windstance, blinking his left eye against the sweat. He stood near the shadow of a large, oblong rock formation shaped like a book on its side. \u201CWhy wait out the entire battle only to attack now? When\u2026\u201D\r\nWhen Dalinar was about to get away. Apparently the Parshendi Shardbearer had been willing to let his fellows throw themselves at Dalinar when it seemed obvious he would fall. Perhaps they let the regular soldiers try to win Shards, as was done in human armies. Now that Dalinar might escape, the potential loss of a Plate and Blade was too great, and so the Shardbearer had been sent to fight him.\r\nThe Shardbearer stepped up, speaking in the thick Parshendi language. Dalinar didn\u2019t understand a word of it. He raised his Blade and fell into stance. The Parshendi said something further, then grunted and stepped forward, swinging.\r\nDalinar cursed to himself, still blinded in his left eye. He dodged back, swinging his Blade and slapping the enemy\u2019s weapon. The parry shook Dalinar inside his armor. His muscles responded sluggishly. Stormlight still leaked from cracks in his armor, but it was abating. It wouldn\u2019t be much longer before the Plate stopped responding.\r\nThe Parshendi Shardbearer attacked again. His stance was unfamiliar to Dalinar, but there was something practiced about it. This wasn\u2019t a savage playing with a powerful weapon. He was a trained Shardbearer. Dalinar was once again forced to parry, something Windstance wasn\u2019t intended do to. His weight-laden muscles were too sluggish to dodge, and his Plate was too cracked to risk letting himself get hit.\r\nThe blow nearly threw him out of stance. He clenched his teeth, throwing weight behind his weapon and intentionally overcorrecting as the Parshendi\u2019s next blow came. The Blades met with a furious clang, throwing off a shower of sparks like a bucket of molten metal dashed into the air.\r\nDalinar recovered quickly and threw himself forward, trying to slam his shoulder into his enemy\u2019s chest. The Parshendi was still full of power, however, his Plate uncracked. He got out of the way and quite nearly hit Dalinar on the back.\r\nDalinar twisted just in time. Then he turned and leaped onto a small rock formation, then stepped to a higher ledge and managed to reach the top. The Parshendi followed, as Dalinar had hoped. The precarious footing raised the stakes\u2014which was just fine with him. A single blow could ruin Dalinar. That meant taking risks.\r\nAs the Parshendi neared the top of the formation, Dalinar attacked, using the advantage of surer footing and high ground. The Parshendi didn\u2019t bother dodging. He took a hit to the helm, which cracked, but gained a chance to swing at Dalinar\u2019s legs.\r\nDalinar leaped backward, feeling painfully sluggish. He barely got out of the way, and wasn\u2019t able to get in a second strike as the Parshendi climbed atop the formation.\r\nThe Parshendi man made an aggressive thrust. Setting his jaw, Dalinar raised his forearm to block and stepped into the attack, praying to the Heralds that his forearm plate would deflect the blow. The Parshendi blade connected, shattering the Plate, sending a shock up Dalinar\u2019s arm. The gauntlet on his fist suddenly felt like a lead weight, but Dalinar kept moving, swinging his blade for his own attack.\r\nNot at the Parshendi\u2019s armor, but at the stone beneath him.\r\nEven as the molten shards of Dalinar\u2019s forearm plate sprayed in the air, he sheared through the rock shelf under his opponent\u2019s feet. The entire section broke free, sending the Shardbearer tumbling backward toward the ground. He hit with a crash.\r\nDalinar slammed his fist\u2014the one with the broken armguard\u2014into the ground and released the gauntlet. It unlatched and he pulled his hand free into the air, sweat making it feel cold. He left the gauntlet\u2014it wouldn\u2019t work properly now that the forearm piece was gone\u2014and roared as he swung his Blade single-handed. He sliced through another chunk of the rock and sent it falling down toward the Shardbearer.\r\nThe Parshendi stumbled to his feet, but the rock smashed down on top of him, sending out a splash of Stormlight and a deep cracking sound. Dalinar climbed down, trying to get to the Parshendi while he was still. Unfortunately, Dalinar\u2019s right leg was dragging, and when he reached the ground, he walked in a limp. If he took the boot off, he wouldn\u2019t be able to hold up the rest of the Shardplate.\r\nHe gritted his teeth, stopping as the Parshendi stood up. He\u2019d been too slow. The Parshendi\u2019s armor, though cracked in several places, was nowhere near as strained as Dalinar\u2019s. Impressively, he\u2019d managed to retain his Shardblade. He leveled his armored head at Dalinar, eyes hidden behind the slit in the helm. Around them, the other Parshendi watched silently, forming a ring, but not interfering.\r\nDalinar raised his Blade, holding it in one gauntleted hand and one bare one. The breeze was cold on his clammy, exposed hand.\r\nThere was no use running. He fought here.\r\nFor the first time in many, many months, Kaladin felt fully awake and alive.\r\nThe beauty of the spear, whistling in the air. The unity of body and mind, hands and feet reacting instantly, faster than thoughts could be formed. The clarity and familiarity of the old spear forms, learned during the most terrible time in his life.\r\nHis weapon was an extension of himself; he moved it as easily and instinctively as he did his fingers. Spinning, he cut through the Parshendi, bringing retribution to those who had slaughtered so many of his friends. Repayment for each and every arrow loosed at his flesh.\r\nWith Stormlight making an ecstatic pulse within him, he felt a rhythm to the battle. Almost like the beat of the Parshendi song.\r\nAnd they did sing. They\u2019d recovered from seeing him drink in the Stormlight and speak the Words of the Second Ideal. They now attacked in waves, fervently trying to get to the bridge and knock it free. Some had leaped to the other side to attack from that direction, but Moash had led bridgemen to respond there. Amazingly, they held.\r\nSyl twirled around Kaladin in a blur, riding the waves of Stormlight that rose from his skin, moving like a leaf on the winds of a storm. Enraptured. He\u2019d never seen her like this before.\r\nHe didn\u2019t break his attacks\u2014in a way, there was only\r\noneattack, as each strike flowed directly into the next. His spear never stopped, and together with his men, he pushed the Parshendi back, accepting each challenge as they stepped forward in pairs.\r\nKilling. Slaughtering. Blood flew in the air and the dying groaned at his feet. He tried not to pay too much attention to that. They were the enemy. Yet the sheer glory of what he did seemed at odds with the desolation he caused.\r\nHe was protecting. He was saving. Yet he was killing. How could something so terrible be so beautiful at the same time?\r\nHe ducked the swing of a fine silvery sword, then brought his spear around to the side, crushing ribs. He spun the spear, shattering its already fractured length against the side of the Parshendi\u2019s comrade. He threw the remains at a third man, then caught a new spear as Lopen tossed it to him. The Herdazian was collecting them from the fallen Alethi nearby to give to Kaladin when needed.\r\nWhen you engaged a man, you learned something about him. Were your enemies careful and precise? Did they bully their way forward, aggressive and domineering? Did they spout curses to make you enraged? Were they ruthless, or did they leave an obviously incapacitated man to live?\r\nHe was impressed by the Parshendi. He fought dozens of them, each with a slightly different style of combat. It seemed they were sending only two or four at him at a time. Their attacks were careful and controlled, and each pair fought as a team. They seemed to respect him for his skill.\r\nMost telling, they seemed to back away from fighting Skar or Teft, who were wounded, instead focusing on Kaladin, Moash, and the other spearmen who showed the most skill. These were not the wild, uncultured savages he had been led to expect. These were professional soldiers who held to an honorable battlefield ethic he had found absent in most of the Alethi. In them, he found what he\u2019d always hoped he would find in the soldiers of the Shattered Plains.\r\nThat realization rocked him. He found himself\r\nrespectingthe Parshendi as he killed them.\r\nIn the end, the storm within drove him forward. He had chosen a course, and these Parshendi would slaughter Dalinar Kholin\u2019s army without a moment\u2019s regret. Kaladin had committed himself. He would see himself and his men through it.\r\nHe wasn\u2019t certain how long he fought. Bridge Four held out remarkably well. Surely they didn\u2019t fight for very long, otherwise they would have been overwhelmed. Yet the multitude of wounded and dying Parshendi around Kaladin seemed to indicate hours.\r\nHe was both relieved and oddly disappointed when a figure in Plate broke through the Parshendi ranks, releasing a flood of soldiers in blue. Kaladin reluctantly stepped back, heart thumping, the storm within dampened. The light had stopped streaming off his skin noticeably. The continual supply of Parshendi with gems in their braids had kept him fueled during the early part of the fight, but the later ones had come to him without gemstones. Another indication that they weren\u2019t the simpleminded subhumans the lighteyes claimed they were. They\u2019d seen what he was doing, and even if they hadn\u2019t understood it, they\u2019d countered it.\r\nHe had enough Light to keep him from collapsing. But as the Alethi pushed back the Parshendi, Kaladin realized how timely their arrival had been.\r\nI need to be very careful with this,he thought. The storm within made him thirst for motion and attack, but using it drained his body. The more of it he used, and the faster he used it, the worse it was when he ran out.\r\nAlethi soldiers took up perimeter defense on both sides of the bridge, and the exhausted bridgemen fell back, many sitting down and holding wounds. Kaladin hurried over to them. \u201CReport!\u201D\r\n\u201CThree dead,\u201D Rock said grimly, kneeling beside bodies he\u2019d laid out. Malop, Earless Jaks, and Narm.\r\nKaladin frowned in sorrow.\r\nBe glad the rest live,he told himself. It was easy to think. Hard to accept. \u201CHow are the rest of you?\u201D\r\nFive more had serious wounds, but Rock and Lopen had seen to them. Those two were learning quite well from Kaladin\u2019s instruction. There was little more Kaladin could do for the wounded. He glanced at Malop\u2019s body. The man had taken an axe cut to the arm, severing it and splintering the bone. He\u2019d died from blood loss. If Kaladin hadn\u2019t been fighting, he might have been able to\u2014\r\nNo. No regrets for the moment.\r\n\u201CPull back across,\u201D he said to the bridgemen, pointing. \u201CTeft, you\u2019re in command. Moash, you strong enough to stay with me?\u201D\r\n\u201CSure am,\u201D Moash said, a grin on his bloody face. He looked excited, not exhausted. All three of the dead had been on his side, but he and the others had fought remarkably well.\r\nThe other bridgemen retreated. Kaladin turned to inspect the Alethi soldiers. It was like looking into a triage tent. Every man had a wound of some sort. The ones at the center stumbled and limped. Those at the outsides still fought, their uniforms bloodied and torn. The retreat had dissolved into chaos.\r\nHe made his way through the wounded, waving for them to cross the bridge. Some did as he said. Others stood about, looking dazed. Kaladin rushed up to one group that seemed better off than most. \u201CWho\u2019s in command here?\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\u2026\u201D The soldier\u2019s face had been cut across the cheek. \u201CBrightlord Dalinar.\u201D\r\n\u201CImmediate command. Who\u2019s your captain?\u201D\r\n\u201CDead,\u201D the man said. \u201CAnd my companylord. And his second.\u201D\r\nStormfather,Kaladin thought. \u201CAcross the bridge with you,\u201D he said, then moved on. \u201CI need an officer! Who\u2019s in command of the retreat?\u201D\r\nAhead, he could make out a figure in scratched blue Shardplate, fighting at the front of group. That would be Dalinar\u2019s son Adolin. He was busy holding the Parshendi off; bothering him would not be wise.\r\n\u201COver here,\u201D a man called. \u201CI\u2019ve found Brightlord Havar! He\u2019s commander of the rear guard!\u201D\r\nFinally, Kaladin thought, rushing through the chaos to find a bearded lighteyed man lying on the ground, coughing blood. Kaladin looked him over, noting the enormous gut wound. \u201CWho\u2019s his second?\u201D\r\n\u201CDead,\u201D said the man beside the commander. He was lighteyed.\r\n\u201CAnd you are?\u201D Kaladin asked.\r\n\u201CNacomb Gaval.\u201D He looked young, younger than Kaladin.\r\n\u201CYou\u2019re promoted,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CGet these men across the bridge as quickly as possible. If anyone asks, you\u2019ve been given a field commission as commander of the rear guard. If anyone claims to outrank you, send them to me.\u201D\r\nThe man started. \u201CPromoted\u2026 Who are you? Can you\r\ndothat?\u201D\r\n\u201CSomeone needs to,\u201D Kaladin snapped. \u201CGo. Get to work.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201C\r\nGo!\u201D Kaladin bellowed.\r\nRemarkably, the lighteyed man saluted him and began yelling for his squad. Kholin\u2019s men were wounded, battered, and dazed, but they were well trained. Once someone took command, orders passed quickly. Squads crossed the bridge, falling into marching formations. Likely, in the confusion, they clung to these familiar patterns.\r\nWithin minutes, the central mass of Kholin\u2019s army was flowing across the bridge like sand in an hourglass. The ring of fighting contracted. Still, men screamed and died in the anarchic tumult of sword against shield and spear against metal.\r\nKaladin hurriedly pulled the carapace off his armor\u2014enraging the Parshendi didn\u2019t feel wise at the moment\u2014then moved among the wounded, looking for more officers. He found a couple, though they were dazed, wounded, and out of breath. Apparently, those who were still battleworthy were leading the two flanks who held back the Parshendi.\r\nTrailed by Moash, Kaladin hurried to the central front line, where the Alethi seemed to be holding the best. Here, finally, he found someone in command: a tall, stately lighteyes with a steel breastplate and matching helm, his uniform a darker shade of blue than the others. He directed the fighting from just behind the front lines.\r\nThe man nodded to Kaladin, yelling to be heard over the sounds of battle. \u201CYou command the bridgemen?\u201D\r\n\u201CI do,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CWhy aren\u2019t your men moving across the bridge?\u201D\r\n\u201CWe are the Cobalt Guard,\u201D the man said. \u201COur duty is to protect Brightlord Adolin.\u201D The man pointed toward Adolin in his blue Shardplate just ahead. The Shardbearer seemed to be pushing toward something.\r\n\u201CWhere\u2019s the highprince?\u201D Kaladin yelled.\r\n\u201CWe\u2019re not sure.\u201D The man grimaced. \u201CHis guardsmen have vanished.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou\r\nhaveto pull back. The bulk of the army is across. If you remain here, you\u2019ll be surrounded!\u201D\r\n\u201CWe will not leave Brightlord Adolin. I\u2019m sorry.\u201D\r\nKaladin looked around. The groups of Alethi fighting at the flanks were barely holding their ground, but they wouldn\u2019t fall back until ordered.\r\n\u201CFine,\u201D Kaladin said, raising his spear and pushing his way through to the front line. Here, the Parshendi fought with vigor. Kaladin cut down one by the neck, spinning into the middle of a group, flashing out with his spear. His Stormlight was nearly gone, but these Parshendi had gemstones in their beards. Kaladin breathed in\u2014just a little, so as to not reveal himself to the Alethi soldiers\u2014and launched into a full attack.\r\nThe Parshendi fell back before his furious assault, and the few members of the Cobalt Guard around him stumbled away, looking stunned. In seconds, Kaladin had a dozen Parshendi on the ground around him, wounded or dead. That opened a gap, and he tore through, Moash on his heels.\r\nA lot of the Parshendi were focused on Adolin, whose blue Shardplate was scraped and cracked. Kaladin had never seen a suit of Shardplate in such a terrible state. Stormlight rose from those cracks in much the way it steamed from Kaladin\u2019s skin when he held\u2014or used\u2014a lot of it.\r\nThe fury of a Shardbearer at war gave Kaladin pause. He and Moash stopped just outside of the man\u2019s fighting range, and the Parshendi ignored the bridgemen, trying with obvious desperation to take down the Shardbearer. Adolin cut down through multiple men at once\u2014but, as Kaladin had seen only once before, his Blade did not slice flesh. Parshendi eyes burned and blackened, and dozens fell dead, Adolin collecting corpses around him like ripened fruit falling from a tree.\r\nAnd yet, Adolin was obviously struggling. His Shardplate was more than just cracked\u2014there were holes in parts. His helm was gone, though he\u2019d replaced it with a regular spearman\u2019s cap. His left leg limped, nearly dragging. That Blade of his was deadly, but the Parshendi drew closer and closer.\r\nKaladin didn\u2019t dare step into range. \u201CAdolin Kholin!\u201D he bellowed.\r\nThe man kept fighting.\r\n\u201CAdolin Kholin!\u201D Kaladin yelled again, feeling a little puff of Stormlight leave him, his voice booming.\r\nThe Shardbearer paused, then looked back at Kaladin. Reluctantly, the Shardbearer pulled back, letting the Cobalt Guard\u2014using the path opened by Kaladin\u2014rush forward and hold back the Parshendi.\r\n\u201CWho are you?\u201D Adolin demanded, reaching Kaladin. His proud, youthful face was slick with sweat, his hair a matted mess of blond mixed with black.\r\n\u201CI\u2019m the man who saved your life,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CI need you to order the retreat. Your troops can\u2019t fight any longer.\u201D\r\n\u201CMy father is out there, bridgeman,\u201D Adolin said, pointing with his overly large Blade. \u201CI saw him just moments ago. His Ryshadium went for him, but neither horse nor man has returned. I\u2019m going to lead a squad to\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CYou are going to\r\nretreat!\u201D Kaladin said, exasperated. \u201CLook at your men, Kholin! They can barely keep their feet, let alone fight. You\u2019re losing dozens by the minute. You need to get them out.\u201D\r\n\u201CI won\u2019t abandon my father,\u201D Adolin said stubbornly.\r\n\u201CFor the peace of\u2026 If you fall, Adolin Kholin, these men have\r\nnothing. Their commanders are wounded or dead. You can\u2019t go to your father; you can barely walk! I repeat,\r\nget your men to safety!\u201D\r\nThe young Shardbearer stepped back, blinking at Kaladin\u2019s tone. He looked northeastward, toward where a figure in slate grey suddenly appeared on a rock outcropping, fighting against another figure in Shardplate. \u201CHe\u2019s so close\u2026.\u201D\r\nKaladin took a deep breath. \u201CI\u2019ll go for him. You lead the retreat. Hold the bridge, but only the bridge.\u201D\r\nAdolin glared at Kaladin. He took a step, but something in his armor gave out, and he stumbled, going to one knee. Teeth gritted, he managed to rise. \u201CCaptainlord Malan,\u201D Adolin bellowed. \u201CTake your soldiers, go with this man. Get my father out!\u201D\r\nThe man Kaladin had spoken to earlier saluted crisply. Adolin glared at Kaladin again, then hefted his Shardblade and stalked with difficulty toward the bridge.\r\n\u201CMoash, go with him,\u201D Kaladin said.\r\n\u201CBut\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CDo it, Moash,\u201D Kaladin said grimly, glancing toward the outcropping where Dalinar fought. Kaladin took a deep breath, tucked his spear under his arm, and dashed off at a dead run.\r\nThe Cobalt Guard yelled at him, trying to keep up, but he didn\u2019t look back. He hit the line of Parshendi attackers, turned and tripped two with his spear, then leaped over the bodies and kept going. Most Parshendi in this patch were distracted by Dalinar\u2019s fight or the battle to get to the bridge; the ranks were thin here between the two fronts.\r\nKaladin moved quickly, drawing in more Light as he ran, dodging and scrambling around Parshendi who tried to engage him. Within moments, he\u2019d reached the place where Dalinar had been fighting. Though the rock shelf was now empty, a large group of Parshendi were gathered around its base.\r\nThere,he thought, leaping forward.\r\nA horse whinnied. Dalinar looked up in shock as Gallant charged into the open ring of ground the watching Parshendi had made. The Ryshadium had come to him. How\u2026 where\u2026? The horse should have been free and safe on the staging plateau.\r\nIt was too late. Dalinar was on one knee, beaten down by the enemy Shardbearer. The Parshendi kicked, smashing his foot into Dalinar\u2019s chest, throwing him backward.\r\nA hit to the helm followed. Another. Another. The helm exploded, and the force of the hits left Dalinar dazed. Where was he? What was happening? Why was he pinned by something so heavy?\r\nShardplate,he thought, struggling to rise.\r\nI\u2019m wearing\u2026 my Shardplate\u2026.\r\nA breeze blew across his face. Head blows; you had to be careful of head blows, even when wearing Plate. His enemy stood over him, looming, and seemed to inspect him. As if searching for something.\r\nDalinar had dropped his Blade. The common Parshendi soldiers surrounded the duel. They forced Gallant back, making the horse whinny. He reared. Dalinar watched him, vision swimming.\r\nWhy didn\u2019t the Shardbearer just finish him? The Parshendi giant leaned down, then spoke. The words were thick with accent, and Dalinar\u2019s mind nearly dismissed them. But here, up close, Dalinar realized something. He understood what was being said. The accent was nearly impenetrable, but the words were in\r\nAlethi.\r\n\u201CIt\r\nisyou,\u201D the Parshendi Shardbearer said. \u201CI have found you at last.\u201D\r\nDalinar blinked in surprise.\r\nSomething disturbed the back ranks of the watching Parshendi soldiers. There was something familiar about this scene, Parshendi all around, Shardbearer in danger. Dalinar had lived it before, but from the other side.\r\nThat Shardbearer couldn\u2019t be talking to him. Dalinar had been hit too hard on the head. He must be delusional. What was that disturbance in the ring of Parshendi watchers?\r\nSadeas,Dalinar found himself thinking, his mind confused.\r\nHe\u2019s come to rescue me, as I rescued him.\r\nUnite them\u2026.\r\nHe\u2019ll come,Dalinar thought.\r\nI know he will. I will gather them\u2026.\r\nThe Parshendi were yelling, moving, twisting. Suddenly, a figure exploded through them. Not Sadeas at all. A young man with a strong face and long, curling black hair. He carried a spear.\r\nAnd he was glowing.\r\nWhat?Dalinar thought, dazed.\r\nKaladin landed in the open circle. The two Shardbearers were at the center, one on the ground, Stormlight trailing faintly from his body. Too faintly. Considering the number of cracks, his gemstones must be almost spent. The other\u2014a Parshendi, judging by the size and shape of the limbs\u2014was standing over the fallen one.\r\nGreat,Kaladin thought, dashing forward before the Parshendi soldiers could collect their wits and attack him. The Parshendi Shardbearer was bent down, focused on Dalinar. The Parshendi\u2019s Plate was leaking Stormlight through a large fissure in the leg.\r\nSo\u2014memory flashing back to the time he rescued Amaram\u2014Kaladin got in close and slammed his spear into the crack.\r\nThe Shardbearer screamed and dropped his Blade in surprise. It puffed to mist. Kaladin whipped his spear free and dodged backward. The Shardbearer swung toward him with a gauntleted fist, but missed. Kaladin jumped in and\u2014throwing his full strength behind the blow\u2014rammed his spear into the cracked leg armor again.\r\nThe Shardbearer screamed even louder, stumbling, then fell to his knees. Kaladin tried to pull his spear free, but the man crumpled on top of it, snapping the shaft. Kaladin dodged back, now facing a ring of Parshendi, empty-handed, Stormlight streaming from his body.\r\nSilence. And then, they began speaking again, the words they\u2019d said before. \u201CNeshua Kadal!\u201D They passed it among themselves, whispering, looking confused. Then they began to chant a song he\u2019d never heard before.\r\nGood enough,Kaladin thought. So long as they weren\u2019t attacking him. Dalinar Kholin was moving, sitting up. Kaladin knelt down, commanding most of his Stormlight into the stony ground, retaining just enough to keep him going, but not enough to make him glow. Then he hurried over to the armored horse at the side of the ring of Parshendi.\r\nThe Parshendi shied away from him, looking terrified. He took the reins and quickly returned to the highprince.\r\nDalinar shook his head, trying to clear his mind. His vision still swam, but his thoughts were reforming. What had happened? He\u2019d been hit on the head, and\u2026 and now the Shardbearer was down.\r\nDown? What had caused the Shardbearer to fall? Had the creature really talked to him? No, he must have imagined that. That, and the young spearman glowing. He wasn\u2019t doing so now. Holding Gallant\u2019s reins, the young man waved at Dalinar urgently. Dalinar forced himself to his feet. Around them, the Parshendi were muttering something unintelligible.\r\nThat Shardplate,Dalinar thought, looking at the kneeling Parshendi.\r\nA Shardblade\u2026 I could fulfill my promise to Renarin. I could\u2026\r\nThe Shardbearer groaned, holding his leg with a gauntleted hand. Dalinar itched to finish the kill. He took a step forward, dragging his unresponsive foot. Around them, the Parshendi troops watched silently. Why didn\u2019t they attack?\r\nThe tall spearman ran up to Dalinar, pulling Gallant\u2019s reins. \u201COn your horse, lighteyes.\u201D\r\n\u201CWe should finish him. We could\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201COn your horse!\u201D the youth commanded, tossing the reins at him as the Parshendi troops turned to engage a contingent of approaching Alethi soldiers.\r\n\u201CYou\u2019re supposed to be an honorable one,\u201D the spearman snarled. Dalinar had rarely been spoken to in such a way, particularly by a darkeyed man. \u201CWell, your men won\u2019t leave without\r\nyou, and\r\nmymen won\u2019t leave without\r\nthem. So you\r\nwillget on your horse and we\r\nwillescape this death-trap. Do you understand?\u201D\r\nDalinar met the young man\u2019s eyes. Then nodded. Of course. He was right; they had to leave the enemy Shardbearer. How would they get the armor out, anyway? Tow the corpse all the way?\r\n\u201CRetreat!\u201D Dalinar bellowed to his soldiers, pulling himself into Gallant\u2019s saddle. He barely made it, his armor had so little Stormlight left.\r\nSteady, loyal Gallant sprang into a gallop down the corridor of escape his men had bought for him with their blood. The nameless spearman dashed behind him, and the Cobalt Guard fell in around them. A larger force of his troops was ahead, on the escape plateau. The bridge still stood, Adolin waiting anxiously at its head, holding it for Dalinar\u2019s retreat.\r\nWith a rush of relief, Dalinar galloped across the wooden deck, reaching the adjoining plateau. Adolin and last of his troops filed along behind him.\r\nHe turned Gallant, looking eastward. The Parshendi crowded up to the chasm, but did not give chase. A group of them worked on the chrysalis atop the plateau. It had been forgotten by all sides in the fervor. They had never followed before, but if they changed their mind now, they could harry Dalinar\u2019s force all the way back to the permanent bridges.\r\nBut they didn\u2019t. They formed ranks and began to chant another of their songs, the same one they sang every time the Alethi forces retreated. As Dalinar watched, a figure in cracked, silvery Shardplate and a red cape stumbled to their forefront. The helm had been removed, but it was too distant to make out any features on the black and red marbled skin. Dalinar\u2019s erstwhile foe raised his Shardblade in a motion that was unmistakable. A salute, a gesture of respect. Instinctively, Dalinar summoned his Blade, and ten heartbeats later raised it to salute in return.\r\nThe bridgemen pulled the bridge across the chasm, separating the armies.\r\n\u201CSet up triage,\u201D Dalinar bellowed. \u201CWe don\u2019t leave anyone behind who has a chance at living. The Parshendi will not attack us here!\u201D\r\nHis men let out a shout. Somehow, escaping felt like more of a victory than any gemheart they\u2019d won. The tired Alethi troops divided into battalions. Eight had marched to battle, and they became eight again\u2014though several had only a few hundred members remaining. Those men trained for field surgery looked through the ranks while the remaining officers got survivor counts. The men began to sit down among the painspren and exhaustionspren, bloodied, some weaponless, many with torn uniforms.\r\nOn the other plateau, the Parshendi continued their odd song.\r\nDalinar found himself focusing on the bridge crew. The youth who had saved him was apparently their leader. Had he fought down a\r\nShardbearer? Dalinar hazily remembered a quick, sharp encounter, a spear to the leg. Clearly the young man was both skilled and lucky.\r\nThe bridgeman\u2019s team acted with far more coordination and discipline than Dalinar would have expected of such lowly men. He could wait no longer. Dalinar nudged Gallant forward, crossing the stones and passing wounded, exhausted soldiers. That reminded him of his own fatigue, but now that he had a chance to sit, he was recovering, his head no longer ringing.\r\nThe leader of the bridge crew was seeing to a man\u2019s wound, and his fingers worked with expertise. A man trained in field medicine, among\r\nbridgemen?\r\nWell, why not?Dalinar thought.\r\nIt\u2019s no odder than their being able to fight so well.Sadeas had been holding out on him.\r\nThe young man looked up. And, for the first time, Dalinar noticed the slave brands on the youth\u2019s forehead, hidden by the long hair. The youth stood, posture hostile, folding his arms.\r\n\u201CYou are to be commended,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CAll of you. Why did your highprince retreat, only to send you back for us?\u201D\r\nSeveral of the bridgemen chuckled.\r\n\u201CHe didn\u2019t send us back,\u201D their leader said. \u201CWe came on our own. Against his wishes.\u201D\r\nDalinar found himself nodding, and he realized that this was the only answer that made sense. \u201CWhy?\u201D Dalinar asked. \u201CWhy come for us?\u201D\r\nThe youth shrugged. \u201CYou allowed yourself to get trapped in there quite spectacularly.\u201D\r\nDalinar nodded tiredly. Perhaps he should have been annoyed at the young man\u2019s tone, but it was only the truth. \u201CYes, but\r\nwhydid you come? And how did you learn to fight so well?\u201D\r\n\u201CBy accident,\u201D the young man said. He turned back to his wounded.\r\n\u201CWhat can I do to repay you?\u201D Dalinar asked.\r\nThe bridgeman looked back at him. \u201CI don\u2019t know. We were going to flee from Sadeas, disappear in the confusion. We might still, but he\u2019ll certainly hunt us down and kill us.\u201D\r\n\u201CI could take your men to my camp, make Sadeas free you from your bondage.\u201D\r\n\u201CI worry that he wouldn\u2019t let us go,\u201D the bridgeman said, eyes haunted. \u201CAnd I worry that your camp would offer no safety at all. This move today by Sadeas. It will mean war between you two, will it not?\u201D\r\nWould it? Dalinar had avoided thinking of Sadeas\u2014survival had taken his focus\u2014but his anger at the man was a seething pit deep within. He\r\nwouldexact revenge on Sadeas for this. But could he allow war between the princedoms? It would shatter Alethkar. More than that, it would destroy the Kholin house. Dalinar didn\u2019t have the troops or the allies to stand against Sadeas, not after this disaster.\r\nHow would Sadeas respond when Dalinar returned? Would he try to finish the job, attacking?\r\nNo,Dalinar thought.\r\nNo, he did it this way for a purpose.Sadeas had not engaged him personally. He had abandoned Dalinar, but by Alethi standards, that was another thing entirely. He didn\u2019t want to risk the kingdom either.\r\nSadeas wouldn\u2019t want outright war, and Dalinar couldn\u2019t\r\naffordoutright war, despite his seething anger. He formed a fist, turning to look at the spearman. \u201CIt will not turn to war,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CNot yet, at least.\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, if that\u2019s the case,\u201D the spearman said, \u201Cthen by taking us into your camp, you commit robbery. The king\u2019s law, the Codes my men always claim you uphold, would demand that you return us to Sadeas. He\r\nwon\u2019tlet us go easily.\u201D\r\n\u201CI will take care of Sadeas,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CReturn with me. I vow that you will be safe. I promise it with every shred of honor I have.\u201D\r\nThe young bridgeman met his eyes, searching for something. Such a hard man he was for one so young.\r\n\u201CAll right,\u201D the spearman said. \u201CWe\u2019ll return. I can\u2019t leave my men back at camp and\u2014with so many men now wounded\u2014we don\u2019t have the proper supplies to run.\u201D\r\nThe young man turned back to his work, and Dalinar rode Gallant in search of a casualty report. He forced himself to contain his rage at Sadeas. It was difficult. No, Dalinar could not let this turn to war\u2014but neither could he let things go back to the way they had been.\r\nSadeas had upset the balance, and it could never be regained. Not in the same way."

      "ChapterName": "69: JUSTICE",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\n\u201CAll is withdrawn for me. I stand against the one who saved my life. I protect the one who killed my promises. I raise my hand. The storm responds.\u201D\r\n\u2014Tanatanev 1173, 18 seconds pre-death. A darkeyed mother of four in her sixty-second year.\r\nNavani pushed her way past the guards, ignoring their protests and the calls of her attending ladies. She forced herself to remain calm. She\r\nwouldremain calm! What she had heard was just rumor. It\r\nhadto be.\r\nUnfortunately, the older she grew, the worse she became at maintaining a brightlady\u2019s proper tranquility. She hastened her step through Sadeas\u2019s warcamp. Soldiers raised hands toward her as she passed, either to offer her aid or to demand she halt. She ignored both; they\u2019d never dare lay a finger on her. Being the king\u2019s mother gained one a few privileges.\r\nThe camp was messy and poorly laid out. Pockets of merchants, whores, and workers made their homes in shanties built on the leeward sides of barracks. Drippings of hardened crem hung from most leeward eaves, like trails of wax left to pour over the side of a table. It was a distinct contrast to the neat lines and scrubbed buildings of Dalinar\u2019s warcamp.\r\nHe will be fine,she told herself.\r\nHe\u2019dbetter\r\nbe fine!\r\nIt was a testament to her disordered state that she barely considered constructing a new street pattern for Sadeas in her head. She made her way directly to the staging area, and arrived to find an army that hardly looked as if it had been to battle. Soldiers without any blood on their uniforms, men chatting and laughing, officers walking down lines and dismissing the men squad by squad.\r\nThat should have relieved her. This didn\u2019t\r\nlooklike a force that had just suffered a disaster. Instead, it made her even more anxious.\r\nSadeas, in unmarred red Shardplate, was speaking with a group of officers in the shade of a nearby canopy. She stalked up to the canopy, but here a group of guards managed to bar her way, forming up shoulder to shoulder while one went to inform Sadeas of her arrival.\r\nNavani folded her arms impatiently. Perhaps she should have taken a palanquin, as her attending ladies had suggested. Several of them, looking beleaguered, were just arriving at the staging area. A palanquin would be faster in the long run, they had explained, as it would leave time for messengers to be sent so Sadeas could receive her.\r\nOnce, she had obeyed such proprieties. She could remember being a young woman, playing the games expertly, delighting in ways to manipulate the system. What had that gotten her? A dead husband whom she\u2019d never loved and a \u201Cprivileged\u201D position in court that amounted to being put out to pasture.\r\nWhat would Sadeas do if she just started screaming? The king\u2019s own mother, bellowing like an axehound whose antenna had been twisted? She considered it as the soldier waited for a chance to announce her to Sadeas.\r\nFrom the corner of her eye, she noticed a youth in a blue uniform arriving in the staging area, accompanied by a small honor guard of three men. It was Renarin, for once bearing an expression other than calm curiosity. Wide-eyed and frantic, he hurried up to Navani.\r\n\u201CMashala,\u201D he pled in his quiet voice. \u201CPlease. What have you heard?\u201D\r\n\u201CSadeas\u2019s army returned without your father\u2019s army,\u201D Navani said. \u201CThere is talk of a rout, though it doesn\u2019t look as if these men have been through one.\u201D She glared at Sadeas, giving serious contemplation to throwing a fit. Fortunately, he finally spoke with the soldier and then sent him back.\r\n\u201CYou may approach, Brightness,\u201D the man said, bowing to her.\r\n\u201CAbout time,\u201D she growled, shoving past and passing underneath the canopy. Renarin joined her, walking more hesitantly.\r\n\u201CBrightness Navani,\u201D Sadeas said, clasping his hands behind his back, imposing in his crimson Plate. \u201CI had hoped to bring you the news at your son\u2019s palace. I suppose that a disaster like this is too large to contain. I express my condolences at the loss of your brother.\u201D\r\nRenarin gasped softly.\r\nNavani steeled herself, folding her arms, trying to quiet the screams of denial and pain that came from the back of her mind. This was a pattern. She often saw patterns in things. In this case, the pattern was that she could never possess anything of value for long. It was always snatched from her just when it began to look promising.\r\nQuiet,she scolded herself. \u201CYou will explain,\u201D she said to Sadeas, meeting his gaze. She\u2019d practiced that look over the decades, and was pleased to see that it discomfited him.\r\n\u201CI\u2019m sorry, Brightness,\u201D Sadeas repeated, stammering. \u201CThe Parshendi overwhelmed your brother\u2019s army. It was folly to work together. Our change in tactics was so threatening to the savages that they brought every soldier they could to this battle, surrounding us.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd so you\r\nleftDalinar?\u201D\r\n\u201CWe fought hard to reach him, but the numbers were simply overpowering. We had to retreat lest we lose ourselves as well! I would have continued fighting, save for the fact that I saw your brother fall with my own eyes, swarmed by Parshendi with hammers.\u201D He grimaced. \u201CThey began carrying away chunks of bloodied Shardplate as prizes. Barbaric monsters.\u201D\r\nNavani felt cold. Cold, numb. How could this happen? After finally\u2014\r\nfinally\u2014making that stone-headed man see her as a woman, rather than as a sister. And now\u2026\r\nAnd now\u2026\r\nShe set her jaw against the tears. \u201CI don\u2019t believe it.\u201D\r\n\u201CI understand that the news is difficult.\u201D Sadeas waved for an attendant to fetch her a chair. \u201CI wish I had not been forced to bring it to you. Dalinar and I\u2026 well, I have known him for many years, and while we did not always see the same sunrise, I considered him an ally. And a friend.\u201D He cursed softly, looking eastward. \u201CThey will pay for this. I will\r\nseethat they pay.\u201D\r\nHe seemed so earnest that Navani found herself wavering. Poor Renarin, pale-faced and wide-eyed, seemed stunned beyond the means to speak. When the chair arrived, Navani refused it, so Renarin sat, earning a glance of disapproval from Sadeas. Renarin grasped his head in his hands, staring at the ground. He was trembling.\r\nHe\u2019s highprince now,Navani realized.\r\nNo.\r\nNo.He was only highprince if she accepted the idea that Dalinar was dead. And he wasn\u2019t. He couldn\u2019t be.\r\nSadeas had all of the bridges,she thought, looking down at the lumberyard.\r\nNavani stepped out into the late-afternoon sunlight, feeling its heat on her skin. She walked up to her attendants. \u201CBrushpen,\u201D she said to Makal, who carried a satchel with Navani\u2019s possessions. \u201CThe thickest one. And my burn ink.\u201D\r\nThe short, plump woman opened the satchel, taking out a long brushpen with a knob of hog bristles on the end as wide as a man\u2019s thumb. Navani took it. The ink followed.\r\nAround her, the guards stared as Navani took the pen and dipped it into the blood-colored ink. She knelt, and began to paint on the stone ground.\r\nArt was about creation. That was its soul, its essence. Creation and order. You took something disorganized\u2014a splash of ink, an empty page\u2014and you built something from it. Something from nothing. The\r\nsoulof creation.\r\nShe felt the tears on her cheeks as she painted. Dalinar had no wife and no daughters; he had nobody to pray for him. And so, Navani painted a prayer onto the stones themselves, sending her attendants for more ink. She paced off the size of the glyph as she continued its border, making it enormous, spreading her ink onto the tan rocks.\r\nSoldiers gathered around, Sadeas stepping from his canopy, watching her paint, her back to the sun as she crawled on the ground and furiously dipped her brushpen into the ink jars. What was a prayer, if not creation? Making something where nothing existed. Creating a wish out of despair, a plea out of anguish. Bowing one\u2019s back before the Almighty, and forming humility from the empty pride of a human life.\r\nSomething from nothing. True creation.\r\nHer tears mixed with the ink. She went through four jars. She crawled, holding her safehand to the ground, brushing the stones and smearing ink on her cheeks when she wiped the tears. When she finally finished, she knelt back on her knees before a glyph twenty paces long, emblazoned as if in blood. The wet ink reflected sunlight, and she fired it with a candle; the ink was made to burn whether wet or dry. The flames burned across the length of the prayer, killing it and sending its soul to the Almighty.\r\nShe bowed her head before the prayer. It was only a single character, but a complex one.\r\nThath.Justice.\r\nMen watched quietly, as if afraid of spoiling her solemn wish. A cold breeze began blowing, whipping at pennants and cloaks. The prayer went out, but that was fine. It wasn\u2019t meant to burn long.\r\n\u201CBrightlord Sadeas!\u201D an anxious voice called.\r\nNavani looked up. Soldiers parted, making way for a runner in green. He hurried up to Sadeas, beginning to speak, but the highprince grabbed the man by the shoulder in a Shardplate grip and pointed, gesturing for his guards to make a perimeter. He pulled the messenger beneath the canopy.\r\nNavani continued to kneel beside her prayer. The flames left a black scar in the shape of the glyph on the ground. Someone stepped up beside her\u2014 Renarin. He went to one knee, resting a hand on her shoulder. \u201CThank you, Mashala.\u201D\r\nShe nodded, standing, her freehand sprinkled with drops of red pigment. Her cheeks were still wet with tears, but she narrowed her eyes, looking through the press of soldiers toward Sadeas. His expression was thunderous, face growing red, eyes wide with anger.\r\nShe turned and pushed her way through the press of soldiers, scrambling up to the rim of the staging field. Renarin and some of Sadeas\u2019s officers joined her in staring out over the Shattered Plains.\r\nAnd there they saw a creeping line of men limping back toward the warcamps, led by a mounted man in slate-grey armor.\r\nDalinar rode Gallant at the head of two thousand six hundred and fifty-three men. That was all that remained of his assault force of eight thousand.\r\nThe long trek back across the plateaus had given him time to think. His insides were still a tempest of emotions. He flexed his left hand as he rode; it was now encased by a blue-painted Shardplate gauntlet borrowed from Adolin. It would take days to regrow Dalinar\u2019s own gauntlet. Longer, if the Parshendi tried to grow a full suit from the one he had left. They would fail, so long as Dalinar\u2019s armorers fed Stormlight to his suit. The abandoned gauntlet would degrade and crumble to dust, a new one growing for Dalinar.\r\nFor now, he wore Adolin\u2019s. They had collected all of the infused gemstones among his twenty-six hundred men and used that Stormlight to recharge and reinforce his armor. It was still scarred with cracks. Healing as much damage as it had sustained would take days, but the Plate was in fighting shape again, if it came to that.\r\nHe needed to make certain it didn\u2019t. He intended to confront Sadeas, and he wanted to be armored when he did. In fact, he\r\nwantedto storm up the incline to Sadeas\u2019s warcamp and declare formal war on his \u201Cold friend.\u201D Perhaps summon his Blade and see Sadeas dead.\r\nBut he wouldn\u2019t. His soldiers were too weak, his position too tenuous. Formal war would destroy him and the kingdom. He had to do something else. Something that protected the kingdom. Revenge would come. Eventually. Alethkar came first.\r\nHe lowered his blue-gauntleted fist, gripping Gallant\u2019s reins. Adolin rode a short distance away. They\u2019d repaired his armor as well, though he now lacked a gauntlet. Dalinar had refused the gift of his son\u2019s gauntlet at first, but had given in to Adolin\u2019s logic. If one of them was going to go without, it should be the younger man. Inside Shardplate, their differences in age didn\u2019t matter\u2014but outside of it, Adolin was a young man in his twenties and Dalinar an aging man in his fifties.\r\nHe still didn\u2019t know what to think of the visions, and their apparent failure in telling him to trust Sadeas. He\u2019d confront that later. One step at a time.\r\n\u201CElthal,\u201D Dalinar called. The highest-ranked officer who had survived the disaster, Elthal was a limber man with a distinguished face and a thin mustache. His arm was in a sling. He\u2019d been one of those to hold the gap alongside Dalinar during the last part of the fight.\r\n\u201CYes, Brightlord?\u201D Elthal asked, jogging over to Dalinar. All of the horses save the two Ryshadium were carrying wounded.\r\n\u201CTake the wounded to my warcamp,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CThen tell Teleb to bring the entire camp to alert. Mobilize the remaining companies.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes, Brightlord,\u201D the man said, saluting. \u201CBrightlord, what should I tell them to prepare for?\u201D\r\n\u201CAnything. But hopefully nothing.\u201D\r\n\u201CI understand, Brightlord,\u201D Elthal said, leaving to follow the orders.\r\nDalinar turned Gallant to march over to the group of bridgemen, still following their somber leader, a man named Kaladin. They\u2019d left their bridge as soon as they\u2019d reached the permanent bridges; Sadeas could send for it eventually.\r\nThe bridgemen stopped as he approached, looking as tired as he felt, then arranged themselves in a subtly hostile formation. They clung to their spears, as if certain he\u2019d try to take them away. They had saved him, yet they obviously didn\u2019t trust him.\r\n\u201CI\u2019m sending my wounded back to my camp,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CYou should go with them.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou\u2019re confronting Sadeas?\u201D Kaladin asked.\r\n\u201CI must.\u201D\r\nI have to know why he did what he did.\u201CI will buy your freedom when I do.\u201D\r\n\u201CThen I\u2019m staying with you,\u201D Kaladin said.\r\n\u201CMe too,\u201D said a hawk-faced man at the side. Soon all of the bridgemen were demanding to stay.\r\nKaladin turned to them. \u201CI should send you back.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat?\u201D asked an older bridgeman with a short grey beard. \u201CYou can risk yourself, but we can\u2019t? We have men back in Sadeas\u2019s camp. We need to get them out. At the very least, we need to stay together. See this through.\u201D\r\nThe others nodded. Again, Dalinar was struck by their discipline. More and more, he was certain Sadeas had nothing to do with that. It was this man at their head. Though his eyes were dark brown, he held himself like a brightlord.\r\nWell, if they wouldn\u2019t go, Dalinar wouldn\u2019t force them. He continued to ride, and soon close to a thousand of Dalinar\u2019s soldiers broke off and marched south, toward his warcamp. The rest of them continued, toward Sadeas\u2019s camp. As they drew closer, Dalinar noticed a small crowd gathering at the final chasm. Two figures in particular stood at their forefront. Renarin and Navani.\r\n\u201CWhat are\r\ntheydoing in Sadeas\u2019s warcamp?\u201D Adolin asked, smiling through his fatigue, edging Sureblood up beside Dalinar.\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CBut the Stormfather bless them for coming.\u201D Seeing their welcome faces, he began to feel it sink in\u2014finally\u2014that he had survived the day.\r\nGallant crossed the last bridge. Renarin was there waiting, and Dalinar rejoiced.\r\nFor once, the boy was displaying outright joy. Dalinar swung free from the saddle and embraced his son.\r\n\u201CFather,\u201D Renarin said, \u201Cyou live!\u201D\r\nAdolin laughed, swinging out of his own saddle, armor clanking. Renarin pulled out of the embrace and grabbed Adolin on the shoulder, pounding the Shardplate lightly with his other hand, grinning widely. Dalinar smiled as well, turning from the brothers to look at Navani. She stood with hands clasped before her, one eyebrow raised. Her face, oddly, bore a few small smears of red paint.\r\n\u201CYou weren\u2019t even worried, were you?\u201D he said to her.\r\n\u201CWorried?\u201D she asked. Her eyes met his, and for the first time, he noticed their redness. \u201CI was terrified.\u201D\r\nAnd then Dalinar found himself grabbing her in an embrace. He had to be careful as he was in Shardplate, but the gauntlets let him feel the silk of her dress, and his missing helm let him smell the sweet floral scent of her perfumed soap. He held her as tightly as he dared, bowing his head and pressing his nose into her hair.\r\n\u201CHmm,\u201D she noted warmly, \u201Cit appears that I was missed. The others are watching. They\u2019ll talk.\u201D\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t care.\u201D\r\n\u201CHmm\u2026 It appears I was\r\nvery muchmissed.\u201D\r\n\u201COn the battlefield,\u201D he said gruffly, \u201CI thought I would die. And I realized it was all right.\u201D\r\nShe pulled her head back, looking confused.\r\n\u201CI have spent too much of my time worrying about what people think, Navani. When I thought my time had arrived, I realized that all my worrying had been wasted. In the end, I was pleased with how I had lived my life.\u201D He looked down at her, then mentally unlatched his right gauntlet, letting it drop to the ground with a clank. He reached up with that callused hand, cupping her chin. \u201CI had only two regrets. One for you, and one for Renarin.\u201D\r\n\u201CSo, you\u2019re saying you can just die, and it would be all right?\u201D\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D he said. \u201CWhat I\u2019m saying is that I faced eternity, and I saw peace there. That will change how I live.\u201D\r\n\u201CWithout all of the guilt?\u201D\r\nHe hesitated. \u201CBeing me, I doubt I\u2019ll banish it entirely. The end was peace, but living\u2026 that is a tempest. Still, I see things differently now. It is time to stop letting myself be shoved around by lying men.\u201D He looked up, toward the ridge above, where more soldiers in green were gathering. \u201CI keep thinking of one of the visions,\u201D he said softly, \u201Cthe latest one, where I met Nohadon. He rejected my suggestion that he write down his wisdom. There\u2019s something there. Something I need to learn.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat?\u201D Navani asked.\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know yet. But I\u2019m close to figuring it out.\u201D He held her close again, hand on the back of her head, feeling her hair. He wished for the Plate to be gone, to not be separated from her by the metal.\r\nBut the time for that had not yet come. Reluctantly, he released her, turning to the side, where Renarin and Adolin were watching them uncomfortably. His soldiers were looking up at Sadeas\u2019s army, gathering on the ridge.\r\nI can\u2019t let this come to bloodshed,Dalinar thought, reaching down and putting his hand into the fallen gauntlet. The straps tightened, connecting to the rest of the armor.\r\nBut I\u2019m also not going to slink back to my camp without confronting him.He at least had to know the purpose of the betrayal. All had been going so well.\r\nBesides, there was the matter of his promise to the bridgemen. Dalinar walked up the slope, bloodstained blue cloak flapping behind him. Adolin clanked up next to him on one side, Navani keeping pace on the other. Renarin followed, Dalinar\u2019s remaining sixteen hundred troops marching up as well.\r\n\u201CFather\u2026\u201D Adolin said, looking at the hostile troops.\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t summon your Blade. This will not come to blows.\u201D\r\n\u201CSadeas abandoned you, didn\u2019t he?\u201D Navani asked quietly, eyes alight with anger.\r\n\u201CHe didn\u2019t just abandon us,\u201D Adolin spat. \u201CHe set us up, then betrayed us.\u201D\r\n\u201CWe survived,\u201D Dalinar said firmly. The way ahead was becoming clearer. He knew what he needed to do. \u201CHe won\u2019t attack us here, but he might try to provoke us. Keep your sword as mist, Adolin, and don\u2019t let our troops make any mistakes.\u201D\r\nThe soldiers in green parted reluctantly, holding spears. Hostile. To the side, Kaladin and his bridgemen walked near the front of Dalinar\u2019s force.\r\nAdolin didn\u2019t summon his Blade, though he regarded Sadeas\u2019s troops around them with contempt. Dalinar\u2019s soldiers couldn\u2019t have felt easy about being surrounded by enemies once again, but they followed him onto the staging field. Sadeas stood ahead. The treacherous highprince waited with arms folded, still wearing his Shardplate, curly black hair blowing in the breeze. Someone had burned an enormous\r\nthathglyph on the stones here, and Sadeas stood at its center.\r\nJustice. There was something magnificently appropriate about Sadeas standing there, treading upon justice.\r\n\u201CDalinar,\u201D Sadeas exclaimed, \u201Cold friend! It appears that I overestimated the odds against you. I apologize for retreating when you were still in danger, but the safety of my men came first. I\u2019m certain you understand.\u201D\r\nDalinar stopped a short distance from Sadeas. The two faced each other, collected armies tense. A cold breeze whipped at a canopy behind Sadeas.\r\n\u201COf course,\u201D Dalinar said, his voice even. \u201CYou did what you had to do.\u201D\r\nSadeas relaxed visibly, though several of Dalinar\u2019s soldiers muttered at that. Adolin silenced them with pointed glances.\r\nDalinar turned, waving Adolin and his men backward. Navani gave him a raised eyebrow, but retreated with the others when he urged her. Dalinar looked back at Sadeas, and the man\u2014looking curious\u2014waved his own attendants back.\r\nDalinar walked up to the edge of the\r\nthathglyph, and Sadeas stepped forward until only inches separated them. They were matched in height. Standing this close, Dalinar thought he could see tension\u2014and anger\u2014in Sadeas\u2019s eyes. Dalinar\u2019s survival had ruined months of planning.\r\n\u201CI need to know why,\u201D Dalinar asked, too quietly for any but Sadeas to hear.\r\n\u201CBecause of my oath, old friend.\u201D\r\n\u201C\r\nWhat?\u201D Dalinar asked, hands forming fists.\r\n\u201CWe swore something together, years ago.\u201D Sadeas sighed, losing his flippancy and speaking openly. \u201CProtect Elhokar. Protect this kingdom.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s what I was doing! We had the same purpose. And we were fighting together, Sadeas. It was\r\nworking.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D Sadeas said. \u201CBut I\u2019m confident I can beat the Parshendi on my own now. Everything we\u2019ve done together, I can manage by splitting my army into two\u2014one to race on ahead, a larger force to follow. I had to take this chance to remove you. Dalinar, can\u2019t you see? Gavilar died because of his weakness.\r\nIwanted to attack the Parshendi from the start, conquer them. He insisted on a treaty, which led to his death. Now you\u2019re starting to act just like him. Those same ideas, the same ways of speaking. Through you they begin to infect Elhokar. He dresses like you. He talks of the Codes to me, and of how perhaps we should enforce them through all the warcamps. He\u2019s beginning to think of\r\nretreating.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd so you\u2019d have me think this an act of honor?\u201D Dalinar growled.\r\n\u201CNot at all,\u201D Sadeas said, chuckling. \u201CI have struggled for years to become Elhokar\u2019s most trusted advisor\u2014but there was always you, distracting him, holding his ear despite my every effort. I won\u2019t pretend this was only about honor, though there was an element of that to it. In the end, I just wanted you gone.\u201D\r\nSadeas\u2019s voice grew cold. \u201CBut you\r\naregoing insane, old friend. You may name me a liar, but I did what I did today as a mercy. A way of letting you die in glory, rather than watching you descend further and further. By letting the Parshendi kill you, I could protect Elhokar from you and turn you into a symbol to remind the others what we\u2019re really doing here. Your death might have become what finally united us. Ironic, if you consider it.\u201D\r\nDalinar breathed in and out. It was hard not to let his anger, his indignation, consume him. \u201CThen tell me one thing. Why not pin the assassination attempt on me? Why clear me, if you were only looking to betray me later on?\u201D\r\nSadeas snorted softly. \u201CBah. Nobody would\r\nreallybelieve that you tried to kill the king. They\u2019d gossip, but they wouldn\u2019t believe it. Blaming you too quickly would have risked implicating myself.\u201D He shook his head. \u201CI think Elhokar knows who tried to kill him. He\u2019s admitted as much to me, though he won\u2019t give me the name.\u201D\r\nWhat?Dalinar thought.\r\nHe knows? But\u2026 how? Why not tell us who?Dalinar adjusted his plans. He wasn\u2019t certain if Sadeas was telling the truth, but if he was, he could use this.\r\n\u201CHe knows it wasn\u2019t you,\u201D Sadeas continued. \u201CI can read that much in him, though he doesn\u2019t realize how transparent he is. Blaming you would have been pointless. Elhokar would have defended you, and I might very well have lost the position of Highprince of Information. But it\r\ndidgive me a wonderful opportunity to make you trust me again.\u201D\r\nUnite them\u2026.The visions. But the man who spoke to Dalinar in them had been dead wrong. Acting with honor\r\nhadn\u2019twon Sadeas\u2019s loyalty. It had just opened Dalinar up to betrayal.\r\n\u201CIf it means anything,\u201D Sadeas said idly, \u201CI\u2019m fond of you. I really am. But you are a boulder in my path, and a force working\u2014against its own knowledge\u2014 to destroy Gavilar\u2019s kingdom. When the chance came along, I took it.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt wasn\u2019t simply a convenient opportunity,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CYou set this up, Sadeas.\u201D\r\n\u201CI planned, but I\u2019m often planning. I don\u2019t always act on my options. Today I did.\u201D\r\nDalinar snorted. \u201CWell, you\u2019ve shown me something today, Sadeas\u2014 shown it to me by the very act of trying to remove me.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd what was that?\u201D Sadeas asked, amused.\r\n\u201CYou\u2019ve shown me that I\u2019m still a threat.\u201D\r\nThe highprinces continued their low-pitched conversation. Kaladin stood to the side of Dalinar\u2019s soldiers, exhausted, with the members of Bridge Four.\r\nSadeas spared a glance for them. Matal stood in the crowd, and had been watching Kaladin\u2019s team the entire time, red-faced. Matal probably knew that he would be punished as Lamaril had been. They should have learned. They should have killed Kaladin at the start.\r\nThey tried,he thought.\r\nThey failed.\r\nHe didn\u2019t know what had happened to him, what had gone on with Syl and the words in his head. It seemed that Stormlight worked better for him now. It had been more potent, more powerful. But now it was gone, and he was\r\nsotired. Drained. He\u2019d pushed himself, and Bridge Four, too far. Too hard.\r\nPerhaps he and the others should have gone to Kholin\u2019s camp. But Teft was right; they needed to see this through.\r\nHe promised,Kaladin thought.\r\nHe promised he would free us from Sadeas.\r\nAnd yet, where had the promises of lighteyes gotten him in the past?\r\nThe highprinces broke off their conference, separating, stepping back from one another.\r\n\u201CWell,\u201D Sadeas said loudly, \u201Cyour men are obviously tired, Dalinar. We can speak later about what went wrong, though I think it is safe to assume that our alliance has proven unfeasible.\u201D\r\n\u201CUnfeasible,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CA kind way of putting it.\u201D He nodded toward the bridgemen. \u201CI will take these bridgemen with me to my camp.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m afraid I cannot part with them.\u201D\r\nKaladin\u2019s heart sank.\r\n\u201CSurely they aren\u2019t worth much to you,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CName your price.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m not looking to sell.\u201D\r\n\u201CI will pay sixty emerald broams per man,\u201D Dalinar said. That drew gasps from the watching soldiers on both sides. It was easily twenty times the price of a good slave.\r\n\u201CNot for a thousand each, Dalinar,\u201D Sadeas said. Kaladin could see the deaths of his bridgemen in those eyes. \u201CTake your soldiers and go. Leave my property here.\u201D\r\n\u201CDo not press me on this, Sadeas,\u201D Dalinar said.\r\nSuddenly, the tension was back. Dalinar\u2019s officers lowered hands to swords, and his spearmen perked up, gripping the hafts of their weapons.\r\n\u201CDo not press you?\u201D Sadeas asked. \u201CWhat kind of threat is that?\r\nLeavemy camp. It\u2019s obvious that there is nothing more between us. If you try to steal my property, I will have every justification in attacking you.\u201D\r\nDalinar stood in place. He looked confident, though Kaladin saw no reason why.\r\nAnd another promise dies,Kaladin thought, turning away. In the end, for all his good intentions, this Dalinar Kholin was the same as the others.\r\nBehind Kaladin, men gasped in surprise.\r\nKaladin froze, then spun around. Dalinar Kholin had summoned his massive Shardblade; it dripped beads of water from having just been summoned. His armor steamed faintly, Stormlight rising from the cracks.\r\nSadeas stumbled back, eyes wide. His honor guard drew their swords. Adolin Kholin reached his hand to the side, apparently beginning to summon his own weapon.\r\nDalinar took one step forward, then drove his Blade point-first into the middle of the blackened glyph on the stone. He took a step back. \u201CFor the bridgemen,\u201D he said.\r\nSadeas blinked. Muttering voices fell silent, and the people on the field seemed too stunned, even, to breathe.\r\n\u201C\r\nWhat?\u201D Sadeas asked.\r\n\u201CThe Blade,\u201D Dalinar said, firm voice carrying in the air. \u201CIn exchange for your bridgemen. All of them. Every one you have in camp. They become mine, to do with as I please, never to be touched by you again. In exchange, you get the sword.\u201D\r\nSadeas looked down at the Blade, incredulous. \u201CThis weapon is worth fortunes. Cities, palaces,\r\nkingdoms.\u201D\r\n\u201CDo we have a deal?\u201D Dalinar asked.\r\n\u201CFather, no!\u201D Adolin Kholin said, his own Blade appearing in his hand. \u201CYou\u2014\u201D\r\nDalinar raised a hand, silencing the younger man. He kept his eyes on Sadeas. \u201C\r\nDo we have a deal?\u201D he asked, each word sharp.\r\nKaladin stared, unable to move, unable to think.\r\nSadeas looked at the Shardblade, eyes full of lust. He glanced at Kaladin, hesitated just briefly, then reached and grabbed the Blade by the hilt. \u201C\r\nTakethe storming creatures.\u201D\r\nDalinar nodded curtly, turning away from Sadeas. \u201CLet\u2019s go,\u201D he said to his entourage.\r\n\u201CThey\u2019re worthless, you know,\u201D Sadeas said. \u201CYou\u2019re of the ten fools, Dalinar Kholin! Don\u2019t you see how mad you are? This will be remembered as the most ridiculous decision ever made by an Alethi highprince!\u201D\r\nDalinar didn\u2019t look back. He walked up to Kaladin and the other members of Bridge Four. \u201CGo,\u201D Dalinar said to them, voice kindly. \u201CGather your things and the men you left behind. I will send troops with you to act as guards. Leave the bridges and come swiftly to my camp. You will be safe there. You have my word of honor on it.\u201D\r\nHe began to walk away.\r\nKaladin shook off his numbness. He scrambled after the highprince, grabbing his armored arm. \u201CWait. You\u2014 That\u2014\r\nWhat just happened?\u201D\r\nDalinar turned to him. Then, the highprince laid a hand on Kaladin\u2019s shoulder, the gauntlet gleaming blue, mismatched with the rest of his slate-grey armor. \u201CI don\u2019t know what has been done to you. I can only guess what your life has been like. But know this. You will not be bridgemen in my camp, nor will you be slaves.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut\u2026\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat is a man\u2019s life worth?\u201D Dalinar asked softly.\r\n\u201CThe slavemasters say one is worth about two emerald broams,\u201D Kaladin said, frowning.\r\n\u201CAnd what do you say?\u201D\r\n\u201CA life is priceless,\u201D he said immediately, quoting his father.\r\nDalinar smiled, wrinkle lines extending from the corners of his eyes. \u201CCoincidentally, that is the exact value of a Shardblade. So today, you and your men sacrificed to buy me twenty-six hundred priceless lives. And all I had to repay you with was a single priceless sword. I call that a bargain.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou really think it was a good trade, don\u2019t you?\u201D Kaladin said, amazed.\r\nDalinar smiled in a way that seemed strikingly paternal. \u201CFor my honor? Unquestionably. Go and lead your men to safety, soldier. Later tonight, I will have some questions for you.\u201D\r\nKaladin glanced at Sadeas, who held his new Blade with awe. \u201CYou said you\u2019d take care of Sadeas. This was what you intended?\u201D\r\n\u201CThis wasn\u2019t taking care of Sadeas,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CThis was taking care of you and your men. I still have work to do today.\u201D\r\nDalinar found King Elhokar in his palace sitting room.\r\nDalinar nodded once more to the guards outside, then closed the door. They seemed troubled. As well they should; his orders had been irregular. But they would do as told. They wore the king\u2019s colors, blue and gold, but they were Dalinar\u2019s men, chosen specifically for their loyalty.\r\nThe door shut with a snap. The king was staring at one of his maps, wearing his Shardplate. \u201CAh, Uncle,\u201D he said, turning to Dalinar. \u201CGood. I had wanted to speak with you. Do you know of these rumors about you and my mother? I realize that nothing untoward could be happening, but I\r\ndoworry about what people think.\u201D\r\nDalinar crossed the room, booted feet thumping on the rich rug. Infused diamonds hung in the corners of the room, and the carved walls had been set with tiny chips of quartz to sparkle and reflect the light.\r\n\u201CHonestly, Uncle,\u201D Elhokar said, shaking his head. \u201CI\u2019m growing very intolerant of your reputation in camp. What they are saying reflects poorly on me, you see, and\u2026\u201D He trailed off as Dalinar stopped about a pace from him. \u201CUncle? Is everything all right? My door guards reported some kind of mishap with your plateau assault today, but my mind was full of thoughts. Did I miss anything vital?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D Dalinar said. Then he raised his leg and kicked the king in the chest.\r\nThe strength of the blow tossed the king backward against his desk. The fine wood shattered as the heavy Shardbearer crashed through it. Elhokar hit the floor, his breastplate cracked just faintly. Dalinar stepped up to him, then delivered another kick to the king\u2019s side, cracking the breastplate again.\r\nElhokar began shouting in panic. \u201CGuards! To me! Guards!\u201D\r\nNobody came. Dalinar kicked again, and Elhokar cursed, catching his boot. Dalinar grunted, but bent down and grabbed Elhokar by the arm, then yanked him to his feet, tossing him toward the side of the room. The king stumbled on the rug, crashing through a chair. Round lengths of wood scattered, splinters spraying out.\r\nWide-eyed, Elhokar scrambled to his feet. Dalinar advanced on him.\r\n\u201CWhat has gone wrong with you, Uncle?\u201D Elhokar yelled. \u201CYou\u2019re mad! Guards! Assassin in the king\u2019s chamber! Guards!\u201D Elhokar tried to run for the door, but Dalinar threw his shoulder against the king, tossing the younger man to the ground again.\r\nElhokar rolled, but got a hand under himself and climbed to his knees, the other hand to the side. A puff of mist appeared in it as he summoned his Blade.\r\nDalinar kicked the king\u2019s hand just as the Shardblade dropped into it. The blow knocked the Blade free, and it dissolved back to mist immediately.\r\nElhokar frantically swung a fist at Dalinar, but Dalinar caught it, then reached down and hauled the king to his feet. He pulled Elhokar forward and slammed his fist into the king\u2019s breastplate. Elhokar struggled, but Dalinar repeated the move, smashing his gauntlet against the Plate, cracking the steel casings around his fingers, making the king grunt.\r\nThe next blow shattered Elhokar\u2019s breastplate in an explosion of molten shards.\r\nDalinar dropped the king to the floor. Elhokar struggled to rise again, but the breastplate was a focus for the Shardplate\u2019s power. Missing it left arms and legs heavy. He went to one knee beside the squirming king. Elhokar\u2019s Shardblade formed again, but Dalinar grabbed the king\u2019s wrist and smashed it against the stone floor, knocking the Blade free yet again. It vanished into mist.\r\n\u201CGuards!\u201D Elhokar squealed. \u201CGuards, guards,\r\nguards!\u201D\r\n\u201CThey won\u2019t come, Elhokar,\u201D Dalinar said softly. \u201CThey\u2019re my men, and I left them with orders not to enter\u2014or let anyone else enter\u2014no matter what they heard. Even if that included pleas for help from you.\u201D\r\nElhokar fell silent.\r\n\u201CThey are my men, Elhokar,\u201D Dalinar repeated. \u201CI trained them. I placed them there. They\u2019ve always been loyal to me.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhy, Uncle? What are you doing? Please, tell me.\u201D He was nearly weeping.\r\nDalinar leaned down, getting close enough to smell the king\u2019s breath. \u201CThe girth on your horse during the hunt,\u201D Dalinar said quietly. \u201CYou cut it yourself, didn\u2019t you?\u201D\r\nElhokar\u2019s eyes grew wider.\r\n\u201CThe saddles were switched before you came to my camp,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CYou did that because you didn\u2019t want to ruin your favorite saddle when it flew free of the horse. You were planning for it to happen, you\r\nmadeit happen. That\u2019s why you\u2019ve been so certain that the girth was cut.\u201D\r\nCringing, Elhokar nodded. \u201CSomeone was trying to kill me, but you wouldn\u2019t believe! I\u2026 I worried it might be you! So I decided\u2026 I\u2026\u201D\r\n\u201CYou cut your own strap,\u201D Dalinar said, \u201Cto create a visible, obvious-seeming attempt on your life. Something that would get me or Sadeas to investigate.\u201D\r\nElhokar hesitated, then nodded again.\r\nDalinar closed his eyes, breathing out slowly. \u201CDon\u2019t you realize what you did, Elhokar? You brought suspicion on me from across the camps! You gave Sadeas an opportunity to destroy me.\u201D He opened his eyes, looking down at the king.\r\n\u201CI had to know,\u201D Elhokar whispered. \u201CI couldn\u2019t trust anyone.\u201D He groaned beneath Dalinar\u2019s weight.\r\n\u201CWhat of the cracked gemstones in your Shardplate? Did you place those too?\u201D\r\n\u201CNo.\u201D\r\n\u201CThen maybe you did uncover something,\u201D Dalinar said with a grunt. \u201CI guess you can\u2019t be completely blamed.\u201D\r\n\u201CThen you\u2019ll let me up?\u201D\r\n\u201CNo.\u201D Dalinar leaned down farther. He laid a hand against the king\u2019s chest. Elhokar stopped struggling, looking up in terror. \u201CIf I push,\u201D Dalinar said, \u201Cyou die. Your ribs crack like twigs, your heart is smashed like a grape. Nobody would blame me. They all whisper that the Blackthorn should have taken the throne for himself years ago. Your guard is loyal to me. There would be nobody to avenge you. Nobody would care.\u201D\r\nElhokar breathed out as Dalinar pressed his hand down just slightly.\r\n\u201CDo you understand?\u201D Dalinar asked quietly.\r\n\u201CNo!\u201D\r\nDalinar sighed, then released the younger man and stood up. Elhokar inhaled with a gasp.\r\n\u201CYour paranoia may be unfounded,\u201D Dalinar said, \u201Cor it may be well founded. Either way, you need to understand something. I am not your enemy.\u201D\r\nElhokar frowned. \u201CSo you\u2019re not going to kill me?\u201D\r\n\u201CStorms, no! I love you like a son, boy.\u201D\r\nElhokar rubbed his chest. \u201CYou\u2026 have very odd paternal instincts.\u201D\r\n\u201CI spent years following you,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CI gave you my loyalty, my devotion, and my counsel. I swore myself to you\u2014promising myself,\r\nvowingto myself, that I would never covet Gavilar\u2019s throne. All to keep my heart loyal. Despite this, you don\u2019t trust me. You pull a stunt like that one with the girth, implicating me, giving your own enemies position against you without knowing it.\u201D\r\nDalinar stepped toward the king. Elhokar cringed.\r\n\u201CWell, now you know,\u201D Dalinar said, voice hard. \u201CIf I\u2019d wanted to kill you, Elhokar, I could have done it a dozen times over. A\r\nhundredtimes over. It appears you won\u2019t accept loyalty and devotion as proof of my honesty. Well, if you act like a child, you get treated like one. You know now, for a fact, that I don\u2019t want you dead. For if I did, I would have crushed your chest and been done with it!\u201D\r\nHe locked eyes with the king. \u201CNow,\u201D Dalinar said, \u201C\r\ndo you understand?\u201D\r\nSlowly, Elhokar nodded.\r\n\u201CGood,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CTomorrow, you\u2019re going to name me Highprince of War.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat?\u201D\r\n\u201CSadeas betrayed me today,\u201D Dalinar said. He walked over to the broken desk, kicking at the pieces. The king\u2019s seal rolled out of its customary drawer. He picked it up. \u201CNearly six thousand of my men were slaughtered. Adolin and I barely survived.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat?\u201D Elhokar said, forcing himself up to a sitting position. \u201CThat\u2019s impossible!\u201D\r\n\u201CFar from it,\u201D Dalinar said, looking at his nephew. \u201CHe saw a chance to pull out, letting the Parshendi destroy us. So he did it. A very Alethi thing to do. Ruthless, yet still allowing him to feign a sense of honor or morality.\u201D\r\n\u201CSo\u2026 you expect me to bring him to trial?\u201D\r\n\u201CNo. Sadeas is no worse, and no better, than the others. Any of the highprinces would betray their fellows, if they saw a chance to do it without risking themselves. I intend to find a way to unite them in more than just name. Somehow. Tomorrow, once you name me Highprince of War, I will give my Plate to Renarin to fulfill a promise. I\u2019ve already given away my Blade to fulfill a different one.\u201D\r\nHe walked closer, meeting Elhokar\u2019s eyes again, then gripped the king\u2019s seal in his hand. \u201CAs Highprince of War, I will enforce the Codes in all ten camps. Then I\u2019ll coordinate the war effort directly, determining which armies get to go on which plateau assaults. All gemhearts will be won by the Throne, then distributed as spoils by you. We\u2019ll change this from a competition to a real war, and I\u2019ll use it to turn these ten armies of ours\u2014 and their leaders\u2014into real soldiers.\u201D\r\n\u201CStormfather! They\u2019ll kill us! The highprinces will revolt! I won\u2019t last a week!\u201D\r\n\u201CThey won\u2019t be pleased, that\u2019s for certain,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CAnd yes, this will involve a great deal of danger. We\u2019ll have to be much more careful with our guard. If you\u2019re right, someone is already trying to kill you, so we should be doing that anyway.\u201D\r\nElhokar stared at him, then looked at the broken furniture, rubbing his chest. \u201CYou\u2019re\r\nserious, aren\u2019t you?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes.\u201D He tossed the seal to Elhokar. \u201CYou\u2019re going to have your scribes draw up my appointment right after I leave.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut I thought you said it was wrong to force men to follow the Codes,\u201D Elhokar said. \u201CYou said that the best way to change people was to live right, and then let them be influenced by your example!\u201D\r\n\u201CThat was before the Almighty lied to me,\u201D Dalinar said. He still didn\u2019t know what to think of that. \u201CMuch of what I told you, I learned from\r\nThe Way of Kings. But I didn\u2019t understand something. Nohadon wrote the book at the end of his life,\r\naftercreating order\u2014after forcing the kingdoms to unite, after rebuilding lands that had fallen in the Desolation.\r\n\u201CThe book was written to embody an ideal. It was given to people who already had momentum in doing what was right. That was my mistake. Before any of this can work, our people need to have a minimum level of honor and dignity. Adolin said something to me a few weeks back, something profound. He asked me why I forced my sons to live up to such high expectations, but let others go about their errant ways without condemnation.\r\n\u201CI have been treating the other highprinces and their lighteyes like adults. An adult can take a principle and adapt it to his needs. But we\u2019re not ready for that yet. We\u2019re children. And when you\u2019re teaching a child, you\r\nrequirehim to do what is right until he grows old enough to make his own choices. The Silver Kingdoms didn\u2019t\r\nbeginas unified, glorious bastions of honor. They were trained that way, raised up, like youths nurtured to maturity.\u201D\r\nHe strode forward, kneeling down beside Elhokar. The king continued to rub his chest, his Shardplate looking strange with the central piece missing.\r\n\u201CWe\u2019re going to make something of Alethkar, nephew,\u201D Dalinar said softly. \u201CThe highprinces gave their oaths to Gavilar, but now ignore those oaths. Well, it\u2019s time to stop letting them. We\u2019re going to win this war, and we\u2019re going to turn Alethkar into a place that men will envy again. Not because of our military prowess, but because people here are safe and because justice reigns. We\u2019re going to do it\u2014or you and I are going to die in the attempt.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou say that with eagerness.\u201D\r\n\u201CBecause I finally know exactly what to do,\u201D Dalinar said, standing up straight. \u201CI was trying to be Nohadon the peacemaker. But I\u2019m not. I\u2019m the Blackthorn, a general and a warlord. I have no talent for back-room politicking, but I am very good at training troops. Starting tomorrow, every man in each of these camps will be mine. As far as I\u2019m concerned, they\u2019re all raw recruits. Even the highprinces.\u201D\r\n\u201CAssuming I make the proclamation.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou will,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CAnd in return, I promise to find out who is trying to kill you.\u201D\r\nElhokar snorted, beginning to remove his Shardplate piece by piece. \u201CAfter that announcement goes out, discovering who\u2019s trying to kill me will become easy. You can put every name in the warcamps on the list!\u201D\r\nDalinar\u2019s smile widened. \u201CAt least we won\u2019t have to guess, then. Don\u2019t be so glum, nephew. You learned something today. Your uncle doesn\u2019t want to kill you.\u201D\r\n\u201CHe just wants to make me a target.\u201D\r\n\u201CFor your own good, son,\u201D Dalinar said, walking to the door. \u201CDon\u2019t fret too much. I\u2019ve got some plans on how, exactly, to keep you alive.\u201D He opened the door, revealing a nervous group of guards keeping at bay a nervous group of servants and attendants.\r\n\u201CHe\u2019s just fine,\u201D Dalinar said to them. \u201CSee?\u201D He stepped aside, letting the guards and servants in to attend their king.\r\nDalinar turned to go. Then he hesitated. \u201COh, and Elhokar? Your mother and I are now courting. You\u2019ll want to start growing accustomed to that.\u201D\r\nDespite everything else that had happened in the last few minutes, this got a look of pure astonishment from the king. Dalinar smiled and pulled the door closed, walking away with a firm step.\r\nMost everything was still wrong. He was still furious at Sadeas, pained by the loss of so many of his men, confused at what to do with Navani, dumbfounded by his visions, and daunted by the idea of bringing the warcamps to unity.\r\nBut at least now he had something to work with."

      "ChapterName": "70: SEA OF GLASS",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\nShallan lay quietly in the bed of her little hospital room. She\u2019d cried herself dry, then had actually retched into the bedpan, over what she had done. She felt miserable.\r\nShe\u2019d betrayed Jasnah. And Jasnah knew. Somehow, disappointing the princess felt worse than the theft itself. This entire plan had been foolish from the start.\r\nBeyond that, Kabsal was dead. Why did she feel so sick about\r\nthat? He\u2019d been an assassin, trying to kill Jasnah, willing to risk Shallan\u2019s life to achieve his goals. And yet, she missed him. Jasnah hadn\u2019t seemed surprised that someone would want to kill her; perhaps assassins were a common part of her life. She likely thought Kabsal a hardened killer, but he\u2019d been sweet with Shallan. Could that all really have been a lie?\r\nHe had to be somewhat sincere,she told herself, curled up on her bed.\r\nIf he didn\u2019t care for me, why did he work so hard to get me to take the jam?\r\nHe had handed Shallan the antidote first, rather than taking it himself.\r\nAnd yet, hedid\r\ntake it eventually,she thought.\r\nHe put that fingerful of jam into his mouth. Why didn\u2019t the antidote save him?\r\nThis question began to haunt her. As it did, something else struck her, something she would have noticed earlier, had she not been distracted by her own betrayal.\r\nJasnah had eaten the bread.\r\nArms wrapped around herself, Shallan sat up, pulling back to the bed\u2019s headboard.\r\nShe ate it, but she wasn\u2019t poisoned,she thought.\r\nMy life makes no sense lately. The creatures with the twisted heads, the place with the dark sky, the Soulcasting\u2026 and now this.\r\nHow had Jasnah survived? How?\r\nWith trembling fingers, Shallan reached to the pouch on the stand beside her bed. Inside, she found the garnet sphere that Jasnah had used to save her. It gave off weak light; most had been used in the Soulcasting. It was enough light to illuminate her sketchpad sitting beside the bed. Jasnah probably hadn\u2019t even bothered to look through it. She was so dismissive of the visual arts. Next to the sketchpad was the book Jasnah had given her. The\r\nBook of Endless Pages. Why had she left that?\r\nShallan picked up the charcoal pencil and flipped through to a blank page in her sketchbook. She passed several pictures of the symbol-headed creatures, some set in this very room. They lurked around her, always. At some times, she thought she saw them in the corners of her eyes. At others, she could hear them whispering. She hadn\u2019t dared speak back to them again.\r\nShe began to draw, fingers unsteady, sketching Jasnah on that day in the hospital. Sitting beside Shallan\u2019s bed, holding the jam. Shallan hadn\u2019t taken a distinct Memory, and wasn\u2019t as accurate as if she had, but she remembered well enough to draw Jasnah with her finger stuck into the jam. She had raised that finger to smell the strawberries. Why? Why put her finger into the jam? Wouldn\u2019t raising the jar to her nose have been enough?\r\nJasnah hadn\u2019t made any faces at the scent. In fact, Jasnah hadn\u2019t mentioned that the jam had spoiled. She\u2019d just replaced the lid and handed back the jar.\r\nShallan flipped to another blank page and drew Jasnah with a piece of bread raised to her lips. After eating it, she\u2019d grimaced. Odd.\r\nShallan lowered her pen, looking at that sketch of Jasnah, piece of bread pinched between her fingers. It wasn\u2019t a perfect reproduction, but it was close enough. In the sketch, it looked like the piece of bread was\r\nmelting. As if it were squished unnaturally between Jasnah\u2019s fingers as she put it into her mouth.\r\nCould it\u2026 could it be?\r\nShallan slid out of the bed, gathering the sphere and carrying it in her hand, sketchpad tucked under her arm. The guard was gone. Nobody seemed to care what happened to her; she was being shipped off in the morning anyway.\r\nThe stone floor was cold beneath her bare feet. She wore only the white\u00A0robe, and felt almost naked. At least her safehand was covered. There was a door to the city outside at the end of the hallway, and she stepped through it.\r\nShe crossed quietly through the city, making her way to the Ralinsa, avoiding dark alleyways. She walked up toward the Conclave, long red hair blowing free behind her, drawing more than a few strange looks and stares. It was so late at night that nobody on the roadway cared enough to ask if she wanted help.\r\nThe master-servants at the entrance to the Conclave let her pass. They recognized her, and more than a few asked if she needed help. She declined, walking alone down to the Veil. She passed inside, then looked up at the walls full of balconies, some of them lit with spheres.\r\nJasnah\u2019s alcove was occupied. Of course it was. Always working, Jasnah was. She\u2019d be particularly bothered by having lost so much time over Shallan\u2019s presumed suicide attempt.\r\nThe lift felt rickety beneath Shallan\u2019s feet as the parshmen lifted her up to Jasnah\u2019s level. She rode in silence, feeling disconnected from the world around her. Walking around through the palace\u2014through the\r\ncity\u2014in only a robe? Confronting Jasnah Kholin\r\nagain? Hadn\u2019t she learned?\r\nBut what did she have to lose?\r\nShe walked down the familiar stone hallway to the alcove, weak blue sphere held before her. Jasnah sat at her desk. Her eyes looked uncharacteristically fatigued, dark circles underneath, her face stressed. She looked up and stiffened as she saw Shallan. \u201CYou are not welcome here.\u201D\r\nShallan walked in anyway, surprised by how calm she felt. Her hands should be shaking.\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t make me call the soldiers to get rid of you,\u201D Jasnah said. \u201CI could have you thrown in prison for a hundred years for what you did. Do you have any idea what\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CThe Soulcaster you wear is a fake,\u201D Shallan said quietly. \u201CIt was a fake the whole time, even before I made the swap.\u201D\r\nJasnah froze.\r\n\u201CI wondered why you didn\u2019t notice the switch,\u201D Shallan said, sitting in the room\u2019s other chair. \u201CI spent weeks confused. Had you noticed, but decided to keep quiet in order to catch the thief? Hadn\u2019t you Soulcast in all that time? It didn\u2019t make any sense. Unless the Soulcaster I stole was a decoy.\u201D\r\nJasnah relaxed. \u201CYes. Very clever of you to realize that. I keep several decoys. You\u2019re not the first to try to steal the fabrial, you see. I keep the real one carefully hidden, of course.\u201D\r\nShallan took out her sketchpad and searched through for a specific picture. It was the image she\u2019d drawn of the strange place with the sea of beads, the floating flames, the distant sun in a black, black sky. Shallan regarded it for a moment. Then she turned it and held it up for Jasnah.\r\nThe look of utter shock Jasnah displayed was nearly worth the night spent feeling sick and guilty. Jasnah\u2019s eyes bulged and she sputtered for a moment, trying to find words. Shallan blinked, taking a Memory of that. She couldn\u2019t help herself.\r\n\u201CWhere did you find that?\u201D Jasnah demanded. \u201CWhat book described that scene to you?\u201D\r\n\u201CNo book, Jasnah,\u201D Shallan said, lowering the picture. \u201CI visited that place. The night when I accidentally Soulcast the goblet in my room to blood, then covered it up by faking a suicide attempt.\u201D\r\n\u201CImpossible. You think I\u2019d believe\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CThere\r\nisno fabrial, is there, Jasnah? There\u2019s no Soulcaster. There never has been. You use the fake \u2018fabrial\u2019 to distract people from the fact that you have the power to Soulcast on your own.\u201D\r\nJasnah fell silent.\r\n\u201CI did it too,\u201D Shallan said. \u201CThe Soulcaster was tucked away in my safepouch. I wasn\u2019t touching it\u2014but that didn\u2019t matter. It was a fake. What I did, I did without it. Perhaps being near you has changed me, somehow. It has something to do with that place and those creatures.\u201D\r\nAgain, no reply.\r\n\u201CYou suspected Kabsal of being an assassin,\u201D Shallan said. \u201CYou knew immediately what had happened when I fell; you were expecting poison, or at least were aware that it was possible. But\r\nyouthought the poison was in the jam. You Soulcast it when you opened the lid and pretended to smell it. You didn\u2019t know how to re-create strawberry jam, and when you tried, you made that vile concoction. You thought to get rid of poison. But you inadvertently Soulcast away the\r\nantidote.\r\n\u201CYou didn\u2019t want to eat the bread either, just in case there was something in it. You always refused it. When I convinced you to take a bite, you Soulcast it into something else as you put it in your mouth. You said you\u2019re terrible at making organic things, and what you created was revolting. But you got rid of the poison, which is why you didn\u2019t succumb to it.\u201D\r\nShallan met her former mistress\u2019s eyes. Was it the fatigue that made her so indifferent to the consequences of confronting this woman? Or was it her knowledge of the truth? \u201CYou did all that, Jasnah,\u201D Shallan finished, \u201Cwith a\r\nfakeSoulcaster. You hadn\u2019t spotted my swap yet. Don\u2019t try to tell me otherwise. I took it on the night when you killed those three thugs.\u201D\r\nJasnah\u2019s violet eyes showed a glimmer of surprise.\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D Shallan said, \u201Cthat long ago. You didn\u2019t replace it with a decoy. You didn\u2019t know you\u2019d been tricked until I got out the fabrial and let you save me with it. It\u2019s all a lie, Jasnah.\u201D\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D Jasnah said. \u201CYou\u2019re just delusional from your fatigue and the stress.\u201D\r\n\u201CVery well,\u201D Shallan said. She stood up, clutching the dim sphere. \u201CI guess I\u2019ll have to show you. If I can.\u201D\r\nCreatures,she said in her head.\r\nCan you hear me?\r\nYes, always,a whisper came in response. Though she\u2019d hoped to hear it, she still jumped.\r\nCan you return me to that place?she asked.\r\nYou need to tell me something true,it replied.\r\nThe more true, the stronger our bond.\r\nJasnah is using a fake Soulcaster,Shallan thought.\r\nI\u2019m sure that\u2019s a truth.\r\nThat\u2019s not enough,the voice whispered.\r\nI must know something true about you. Tell me. The stronger the truth, the more hidden it is, the more powerful the bond. Tell me. Tell me. What are you?\r\n\u201CWhat am I?\u201D Shallan whispered. \u201CTruthfully?\u201D It was a day for confrontation. She felt strangely strong, steady. Time to speak it. \u201CI\u2019m a murderer. I killed my father.\u201D\r\nAh,the voice whispered.\r\nA powerful truth indeed\u2026.\r\nAnd the alcove vanished.\r\nShallan fell, dropping into that sea of dark glass beads. She struggled, trying to stay at the surface. She managed it for a moment. Then something tugged on her leg, pulling her down. She screamed, slipping beneath the surface, tiny beads of glass filling her mouth. She panicked. She was going to\u2014\r\nThe beads above her parted. Those beneath her surged, bearing her upward, out to where someone stood, hand outstretched. Jasnah, back to the black sky, face lit by nearby hovering flames. Jasnah grasped Shallan\u2019s hand, pulling her upward, onto something. A raft.\r\nMadefrom the beads of glass. They seemed to obey Jasnah\u2019s will.\r\n\u201CIdiot girl,\u201D Jasnah said, waving. The oceanlike beads to the left split, and the raft lurched, bearing them sideways toward a few flames of light. Jasnah shoved Shallan into one of the small flames, and she fell backward off the raft.\r\nAnd hit the floor of the alcove. Jasnah sat where she had been, eyes closed. A moment later, she opened them, giving Shallan an angry look.\r\n\u201CIdiot girl!\u201D Jasnah repeated. \u201CYou have no\r\nideahow dangerous that was. Visiting Shadesmar with only a single dim sphere? Idiot!\u201D\r\nShallan coughed, feeling as if she still had beads in her throat. She stumbled to her feet, meeting Jasnah\u2019s gaze. The other woman still looked angry, but said nothing.\r\nShe knows that I have her,Shallan realized.\r\nIf I spread the truth\u2026\r\nWhat would it mean? She had strange powers. Did that make Jasnah some kind of Voidbringer? What would people say? No wonder she\u2019d created the decoy.\r\n\u201CI want to be part of it,\u201D Shallan found herself saying.\r\n\u201CExcuse me?\u201D\r\n\u201CWhatever you\u2019re doing. Whatever it is you\u2019re researching. I want to be part of it.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou have no idea what you\u2019re saying.\u201D\r\n\u201CI know,\u201D Shallan said. \u201CI\u2019m ignorant. There\u2019s a simple cure for that.\u201D She stepped forward. \u201CI want to\r\nknow, Jasnah. I want to be your ward in truth. Whatever the source of this thing you can do, I can do it too. I want you to train me and let me be part of your work.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou stole from me.\u201D\r\n\u201CI know,\u201D Shallan said. \u201CAnd I\u2019m sorry.\u201D\r\nJasnah raised an eyebrow.\r\n\u201CI won\u2019t excuse myself,\u201D Shallan said. \u201CBut Jasnah, I came here intending to steal from you. I was planning it from the beginning.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s supposed to make me feel better?\u201D\r\n\u201CI planned to steal from Jasnah the bitter heretic,\u201D Shallan said. \u201CI didn\u2019t realize I\u2019d come to regret the need for that theft. Not just because of you, but because it meant leaving\r\nthis. What I\u2019ve come to love. Please. I made a mistake.\u201D\r\n\u201CA large one. Insurmountable.\u201D\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t make a larger one by sending me away. I can be someone you don\u2019t have to lie to. Someone who knows.\u201D\r\nJasnah sat back.\r\n\u201CI stole the fabrial on the night you killed those men, Jasnah,\u201D Shallan said. \u201CI\u2019d decided I couldn\u2019t do it, but you convinced me that truth was not as simple as I thought it. You\u2019ve opened a box full of storms in me. I made a mistake. I\u2019ll make more. I need you.\u201D\r\nJasnah took a deep breath. \u201CSit down.\u201D\r\nShallan sat.\r\n\u201CYou will never lie to me again,\u201D Jasnah said, raising a finger. \u201CAnd you will never steal from me, or anyone, again.\u201D\r\n\u201CI promise.\u201D\r\nJasnah sat for a moment, then sighed. \u201CScoot over here,\u201D she said, pulling open a book.\r\nShallan obeyed as Jasnah took out several sheets filled with notes. \u201CWhat is this?\u201D Shallan asked.\r\n\u201CYou wanted to be part of what I\u2019m doing? Well, you\u2019ll need to read this.\u201D Jasnah looked down at the notes. \u201CIt\u2019s about the Voidbringers.\u201D"

      "ChapterName": "71: RECORDED IN BLOOD",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\nSzeth-son-son-Vallano, Truthless of Shinovar, walked with bowed back, carrying a sack of grain down off the ship and onto the docks of Kharbranth. The City of Bells smelled of a fresh ocean morning, peaceful yet excited, fishermen calling to friends as they prepared their nets.\r\nSzeth joined the other porters, carrying his sack through the twisting streets. Perhaps another merchant might have used a chull cart, but Kharbranth was infamous for its crowds and its steep walkways. A line of porters was an efficient option.\r\nSzeth kept his eyes down. Partially to imitate the look of a worker. Partially to lower his gaze from the blazing sun above, the god of gods, who watched him and saw his shame. Szeth should not have been out during the day. He should have hidden his terrible face.\r\nHe felt his every step should leave a bloody footprint. The massacres he\u2019d committed these months, working for his hidden master\u2026 He could hear the dead scream every time he closed his eyes. They grated against his soul, rubbing it to nothing, haunting him, consuming him.\r\nSo many dead. So very many dead.\r\nWas he losing his mind? Each time he went on an assassination, he found himself blaming the victims. He cursed them for not being strong enough to fight back and kill him.\r\nDuring each of his slaughters, he wore white, just as he had been commanded.\r\nOne foot in front of the other. Don\u2019t think. Don\u2019t focus on what you\u2019ve done. On what you\u2019re\u2026 going to do.\r\nHe had reached the last name on the list: Taravangian, the king of Kharbranth. A beloved monarch, known for building and maintaining hospitals in his city. It was known as far away as Azir that if you were sick, Taravangian would take you in. Come to Kharbranth and be healed. The king loved all.\r\nAnd Szeth was going to kill him.\r\nAt the top of the steep city, Szeth lugged his sack with the other porters around to the back of the palace structure, entering a dim stone corridor. Taravangian was a simpleminded man. That should have made Szeth feel more guilty, but he found himself consumed by loathing. Taravangian would not be smart enough to prepare for Szeth. Fool. Idiot. Would Szeth never face a foe strong enough to kill him?\r\nSzeth had come to the city early and taken the job as a porter. He had needed to research and study, for the instructions commanded him\u2014for once\u2014not to kill anyone else in performing this assassination. Taravangian\u2019s murder was to be done quietly.\r\nWhy the difference? The instructions stated that he was to deliver a message. \u201CThe others are dead. I\u2019ve come to finish the job.\u201D The instructions were explicit: Make certain Taravangian heard and acknowledged the words before harming him.\r\nThis was looking like a work of vengeance. Someone had sent Szeth to hunt down and destroy the men who had wronged him. Szeth laid his sack down in the palace larder. He turned automatically, following the shuffling line of porters back down the hallway. He nodded toward the servants\u2019 privy, and the portermaster waved for him to go ahead. Szeth had made this same haul on several occasions, and could be trusted\u2014presumably\u2014to do his business and catch up.\r\nThe privy didn\u2019t smell half as foul as he had anticipated. It was a dark room, cut into the underground cavern, but a candle burned beside a man standing at the pissing trough. He nodded to Szeth, tying up the front of his trousers and wiping his fingers on the sides as he walked to the door. He took his candle, but kindly lit a leftover stub before withdrawing.\r\nAs soon as he was gone, Szeth infused himself with Stormlight from his pouch and laid his hand on the door, performing a Full Lashing between it and the frame, locking it closed. His Shardblade came out next. In the palace, everything was built downward. Trusting the maps he\u2019d purchased, he knelt and carved a square of rock from the floor, wider at the bottom. As it began to slide down, Szeth infused it with Stormlight, performing half a Basic Lashing upward, making the rock weightless.\r\nNext, he Lashed himself upward with a subtle Lashing that left him weighing only a tenth his normal weight. He leapt onto the rock, and his lessened weight pushed the rock down slowly. He rode it down into the room below. Three couches with plush violet cushions lined the walls, sitting beneath fine silver mirrors. The lighteyes\u2019 privy. A lamp burned with a small flame in the sconce, but Szeth was alone.\r\nThe stone thumped softly to the floor, and Szeth leaped off. He shed his clothing, revealing a black and white master-servant\u2019s outfit underneath. He took a matching cap from the pocket and slipped it on, reluctantly dismissed his Blade, then slipped into the hallway and quickly Lashed the door shut.\r\nThese days, he rarely gave a thought to the fact that he walked on stone. Once, he would have revered a corridor of rock like this. Had that man once been him? Had he ever revered anything?\r\nSzeth hurried onward. His time was short. Fortunately, King Taravangian kept a strict schedule. Seventh bell: private reflection in his study. Szeth could see the doorway into the study ahead, guarded by two soldiers.\r\nSzeth bowed his head, hiding his Shin eyes and hurrying up to them. One of the men held out his hand wardingly, so Szeth grabbed it, twisting, shattering the wrist. He smashed his elbow into the man\u2019s face, throwing him back against the wall.\r\nThe man\u2019s stunned companion opened his mouth to yell, but Szeth kicked him in the stomach. Even without a Shardblade, he was dangerous, infused with Stormlight and trained in kammar. He grabbed the second guard by the hair and slammed his forehead against the rock floor. Then he rose and kicked open the door.\r\nHe walked into a room well illuminated by a double row of lamps on the left. Crammed bookcases covered the right wall from floor to ceiling. A man sat cross-legged on a small rug directly ahead of Szeth. The man looked out an enormous window cut through the rock, staring at the ocean beyond.\r\nSzeth strode forward. \u201CI have been instructed to tell you that the others are dead. I\u2019ve come to finish the job.\u201D He raised his hands, Shardblade forming.\r\nThe king did not turn.\r\nSzeth hesitated. He had to make certain the man acknowledged what had been said. \u201CDid you hear me?\u201D Szeth demanded, striding forward.\r\n\u201CDid you kill my guards, Szeth-son-son-Vallano?\u201D the king asked quietly.\r\nSzeth froze. He cursed and stepped backward, raising his Blade in a defensive stance. Another trap?\r\n\u201CYou have done your work well,\u201D the king said, still not facing him. \u201CLeaders dead, lives lost. Panic and chaos. Was this your destiny? Do you wonder? Given that monstrosity of a Shardblade by your people, cast out and absolved of any sin your masters might require of you?\u201D\r\n\u201CI am not absolved,\u201D Szeth said, still wary. \u201CIt is a common mistake stone-walkers make. Each life I take weighs me down, eating away at my soul.\u201D\r\nThe voices\u2026 the screams\u2026 spirits below, I can hear them howling\u2026.\r\n\u201CYet you kill.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt is my punishment,\u201D Szeth said. \u201CTo kill, to have no choice, but to bear the sins nonetheless. I am Truthless.\u201D\r\n\u201CTruthless,\u201D the king mused. \u201CI would say that you know much truth. More than your countrymen, now.\u201D He finally turned to face Szeth, and Szeth saw that he had been wrong about this man. King Taravangian was no simpleton. He had keen eyes and a wise, knowing face, rimmed with a full white beard, the mustaches drooping like arrow points. \u201CYou have seen what death and murder do to a man. You could say, Szeth-son-son-Vallano, that you bear great sins for your people. You understand what they cannot. And so you have truth.\u201D\r\nSzeth frowned. And then it began to make sense. He knew what would happen next, even as the king reached into his voluminous sleeve and withdrew a small rock that glittered in the light of two dozen lamps. \u201CYou were always him,\u201D Szeth said. \u201CMy unseen master.\u201D\r\nThe king set the rock on the ground between them. Szeth\u2019s Oathstone.\r\n\u201CYou put your own name on the list,\u201D Szeth said.\r\n\u201CIn case you were captured,\u201D Taravangian said. \u201CThe best defense against suspicion is to be grouped with the victims.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd if I\u2019d killed you?\u201D\r\n\u201CThe instructions were explicit,\u201D Taravangian said. \u201CAnd, as we have determined, you are\r\nquitegood at following them. I probably needn\u2019t say it, but I order you\r\nnotto harm me. Now, did you kill my guards?\u201D\r\n\u201CI do not know,\u201D Szeth said, forcing himself to drop to one knee and dismissing his Blade. He spoke loudly, trying to drown out the screams that he thought\u2014for certain\u2014must be coming from the upper eaves of the room. \u201CI knocked them both unconscious. I believe I cracked one man\u2019s skull.\u201D\r\nTaravangian breathed out, sighing. He rose, stepping to the doorway. Szeth glanced over his shoulder to note the aged king inspecting the guards and seeing to their wounds. Taravangian called for help, and other guards arrived to see to the men.\r\nSzeth was left with a terrible storm of emotions. This kindly, contemplative man had sent him to kill and murder? He had caused the screams?\r\nTaravangian returned.\r\n\u201CWhy?\u201D Szeth asked, voice hoarse. \u201CVengeance?\u201D\r\n\u201CNo.\u201D Taravangian sounded very tired. \u201CSome of those men you killed were my dear friends, Szeth-son-son-Vallano.\u201D\r\n\u201CMore insurance?\u201D Szeth spat. \u201CTo keep yourself from suspicion?\u201D\r\n\u201CIn part. And in part because their deaths were necessary.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhy?\u201D Szeth asked. \u201CWhat could it possibly have served?\u201D\r\n\u201CStability. Those you killed were among the most powerful and influential men in Roshar.\u201D\r\n\u201CHow does that help stability?\u201D\r\n\u201CSometimes,\u201D Taravangian said, \u201Cyou must tear down a structure to build a new one with stronger walls.\u201D He turned around, looking out over the ocean. \u201CAnd we are going to need strong walls in the coming years. Very, very strong walls.\u201D\r\n\u201CYour words are like the hundred doves.\u201D\r\n\u201C\r\nEasy to release, difficult to keep,\u201D Taravangian said, speaking the words in Shin.\r\nSzeth looked up sharply. This man spoke the Shin language and knew his people\u2019s proverbs? Odd to find in a stonewalker. Odder to find in a murderer.\r\n\u201CYes, I speak your language. Sometimes I wonder if the Lifebrother himself sent you to me.\u201D\r\n\u201CTo bloody myself so that you wouldn\u2019t have to,\u201D Szeth said. \u201CYes, that sounds like something one of your Vorin gods would do.\u201D\r\nTaravangian fell quiet. \u201CGet up,\u201D he finally said.\r\nSzeth obeyed. He would always obey his master. Taravangian led him to a door set into the side of the study. The aged man pulled a sphere lamp off the wall, lighting a winding stairwell of deep, narrow steps. They followed it and eventually came to a landing. Taravangian pushed open another door and entered a large room that wasn\u2019t on any of the palace maps that Szeth had purchased or bribed a look at. It was long, with wide railings on the sides, giving it a terraced look. Everything was painted white.\r\nIt was filled with beds. Hundreds and hundreds of them. Many were occupied.\r\nSzeth followed the king, frowning. An enormous hidden room, cut into the stone of the Conclave? People bustled about wearing coats of white. \u201CA hospital?\u201D Szeth said. \u201CYou expect me to find your humanitarian efforts a redemption for what you have commanded of me?\u201D\r\n\u201CThis is not humanitarian work,\u201D Taravangian said, walking forward slowly, white-and-orange robes rustling. Those they passed bowed to him with reverence. Taravangian led Szeth to an alcove of beds, each with a sickly person in it. There were healers working on them. Doing something to their arms.\r\nDraining their blood.\r\nA woman with a writing clipboard stood near the beds, pen held, waiting for something. What?\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t understand,\u201D Szeth said, watching in horror as the four patients grew pale. \u201CYou\u2019re killing them, aren\u2019t you?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes. We don\u2019t need the blood; it is merely a way to kill slowly and easily.\u201D\r\n\u201CEvery one of them? The people in this room?\u201D\r\n\u201CWe try to select only the worst cases to move here, for once they are brought to this place, we cannot let them leave if they begin to recover.\u201D He turned to Szeth, eyes sorrowful. \u201CSometimes we need more bodies than the terminally sick can provide. And so we must bring the forgotten and the lowly. Those who will not be missed.\u201D\r\nSzeth couldn\u2019t speak. He couldn\u2019t voice his horror and revulsion. In front of him, one of the victims\u2014a man in his younger years\u2014expired. Two of those remaining were children. Szeth stepped forward. He had to stop this. He had to\u2014\r\n\u201CYou will still yourself,\u201D Taravangian said. \u201CAnd you will return to my side.\u201D\r\nSzeth did as his master commanded. What were a few more deaths? Just another set of screams to haunt him. He could hear them now, coming from beneath beds, behind furniture.\r\nOr I could kill him,Szeth thought.\r\nI could stop this.\r\nHe nearly did it. But honor prevailed, for the moment.\r\n\u201CYou see, Szeth-son-son-Vallano,\u201D Taravangian said. \u201CI did not send you to do my bloody work for me. I do it here, myself. I have personally held the knife and released the blood from the veins of many. Much like you, I know I cannot escape my sins. We are two men of one heart. This is one reason why I sought you out.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut\r\nwhy?\u201D Szeth said.\r\nOn the beds, a dying youth started speaking. One of the women with the clipboards stepped forward quickly, recording the words.\r\n\u201CThe day was ours, but they took it,\u201D the boy cried. \u201CStormfather! You cannot have it. The day is ours. They come, rasping, and the lights fail. Oh, Stormfather!\u201D The boy arched his back, then fell still suddenly, eyes dead.\r\nThe king turned to Szeth. \u201CIt is better for one man to sin than for a people to be destroyed, wouldn\u2019t you say, Szeth-son-son-Vallano?\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2026\u201D\r\n\u201CWe do not know why some speak when others do not,\u201D Taravangian said. \u201CBut the dying see something. It began seven years ago, about the time when King Gavilar was investigating the Shattered Plains for the first time.\u201D His eyes grew distant. \u201CIt is coming, and these people see it. On that bridge between life and the endless ocean of death, they view something. Their words might save us.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou are a monster.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D Taravangian said. \u201CBut I am the monster who will save this world.\u201D He looked at Szeth. \u201CI have a name to add to your list. I had hoped to avoid doing this, but recent events have made it inevitable. I cannot let him seize control. It will undermine everything.\u201D\r\n\u201CWho?\u201D Szeth asked, wondering if anything at all could horrify him further.\r\n\u201CDalinar Kholin,\u201D Taravangian said. \u201CI\u2019m afraid it must be done quickly, before he can unite the Alethi highprinces. You will go to the Shattered Plains and end him.\u201D He hesitated. \u201CIt must be done brutally, I\u2019m afraid.\u201D\r\n\u201CI have rarely had the luxury of working otherwise,\u201D Szeth said, closing his eyes.\r\nThe screams greeted him."

You Soulcast my blood, didn\u2019t you?\u201D\r\n\u201CTo remove the poison,\u201D Jasnah said. \u201CYes. It acted extremely quickly; as I said, it must have been a very concentrated form of the powder. I had to Soulcast your blood several times as we got you to vomit. Your body continued to absorb the poison.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut you said you aren\u2019t good with organics,\u201D Shallan said. \u201CYou turned the strawberry jam into something inedible.\u201D\r\n\u201CBlood isn\u2019t the same,\u201D Jasnah said, waving her hand. \u201CIt\u2019s one of the Essences. You\u2019ll learn this, should I actually decide to teach you Soulcasting. For now, know that the pure form of an Essence is quite easy to make; the eight kinds of blood are easier to create than water, for instance. Creating something as complex as strawberry jam, however\u2014a mush made from a fruit I\u2019d never before tasted or smelled\u2014was well beyond my abilities.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd the ardents,\u201D Shallan said. \u201CThose who Soulcast? Do they actually use fabrials, or is it all a hoax?\u201D\r\n\u201CNo, Soulcasting fabrials are real. Quite real. So far as I know, everyone else who does what I\u2014what\r\nwe\u2014can do uses a fabrial to accomplish it.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat of the creatures with the symbol heads?\u201D Shallan asked. She flipped through her sketches, then held up an image of them. \u201CDo you see them too? How are they related?\u201D\r\nJasnah frowned, taking the image. \u201CYou see beings like this? In Shadesmar?\u201D\r\n\u201CThey appear in my drawings,\u201D Shallan said. \u201CThey\u2019re around me, Jasnah. You don\u2019t see them? Am I\u2014\u201D\r\nJasnah held up a hand. \u201CThese are a type of spren, Shallan. They\r\narerelated to what you do.\u201D She tapped the desk softly. \u201CTwo orders of the Knights Radiant possessed inherent Soulcasting ability; it was based on their powers that the original fabrials were designed, I believe. I had assumed that you\u2026 But no, that obviously wouldn\u2019t make sense. I see now.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat?\u201D\r\n\u201CI will explain as I train you,\u201D Jasnah said, handing back the sheet. \u201CYou will need a greater foundation before you can grasp it. Suffice it to say that each Radiant\u2019s abilities were tied to the spren.\u201D\r\n\u201CWait,\r\nRadiants? But\u2014\u201D\r\n\u201CI will explain,\u201D Jasnah said. \u201CBut first, we must speak of the Voidbringers.\u201D\r\nShallan nodded. \u201CYou think they\u2019ll return, don\u2019t you?\u201D\r\nJasnah studied her. \u201CWhat makes you say that?\u201D\r\n\u201CThe legends say the Voidbringers came a hundred times to try to destroy mankind,\u201D Shallan continued. \u201CI\u2026 read some of your notes.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou\r\nwhat?\u201D\r\n\u201CI was looking for information on Soulcasting,\u201D Shallan confessed.\r\nJasnah sighed. \u201CWell, I suppose it is the least of your crimes.\u201D\r\n\u201CI can\u2019t understand,\u201D Shallan said. \u201CWhy are you bothering with these stories of myths and shadows? Other scholars\u2014scholars I know you respect\u2014consider the Voidbringers to be a fabrication. Yet you chase stories from rural farmers and write them down in your notebook. Why, Jasnah? Why do you have faith in this when you reject things that are so much more plausible?\u201D\r\nJasnah looked over her sheets of paper. \u201CDo you know the real difference between me and a believer, Shallan?\u201D\r\nShallan shook her head.\r\n\u201CIt strikes me that religion\u2014in its essence\u2014seeks to take natural events and ascribe supernatural causes to them. I, however, seek to take supernatural events and find the\r\nnaturalmeanings behind them. Perhaps that is the final dividing line between science and religion. Opposite sides of a card.\u201D\r\n\u201CSo\u2026 you think\u2026\u201D\r\n\u201CThe Voidbringers had a natural, real-world correlate,\u201D Jasnah said firmly. \u201CI\u2019m certain of it. Something\r\ncausedthe legends.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat was it?\u201D\r\nJasnah handed Shallan a page of notes. \u201CThese are the best I\u2019ve been able to find. Read them. Tell me what you think.\u201D\r\nShallan scanned the page. Some of the quotes\u2014or at least the concepts\u2014were familiar to her from what she\u2019d read already.\r\nSuddenly dangerous. Like a calm day that became a tempest.\r\n\u201CThey were real,\u201D Jasnah repeated.\r\nBeings of ash and fire.\r\n\u201CWe fought with them,\u201D Jasnah said. \u201CWe fought so often that men began to speak of the creatures in metaphor. A hundred battles\u2014ten tenfolds\u2026\u201D\r\nFlame and char. Skin so terrible. Eyes like pits of blackness. Music when they kill.\r\n\u201CWe defeated them\u2026\u201D Jasnah said.\r\nShallan felt a chill.\r\n\u201C\u2026but the legends lie about one thing,\u201D Jasnah continued. \u201CThey claim we chased the Voidbringers off the face of Roshar or destroyed them. But that\u2019s not how humans work. We don\u2019t throw away something we can use.\u201D\r\nShallan rose, walking to the edge of the balcony, looking out at the lift, which was slowly being lowered by its two porters.\r\nParshmen. With skin of black and red.\r\nAsh and fire.\r\n\u201CStormfather\u2026\u201D Shallan whispered, horrified.\r\n\u201CWe didn\u2019t destroy the Voidbringers,\u201D Jasnah said from behind, her voice haunted. \u201CWe\r\nenslavedthem.\u201D"

      "ChapterName": "73: TRUST",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\nThe chill spring weather might finally have slipped back into summer. It was still cool at night, but not uncomfortably so. Kaladin stood on Dalinar Kholin\u2019s staging ground, looking eastward over the Shattered Plains.\r\nEver since the failed betrayal and subsequent rescue earlier, Kaladin had found himself nervous. Freedom. Bought with a Shardblade. It seemed impossible. His every life experience taught him to expect a trap.\r\nHe clasped his hands behind him; Syl sat on his shoulder.\r\n\u201CDare I trust him?\u201D he asked softly.\r\n\u201CHe\u2019s a good man,\u201D Syl said. \u201CI\u2019ve watched him. Despite that\r\nthinghe carried.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat thing?\u201D\r\n\u201CThe Shardblade.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat do you care about it?\u201D\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know,\u201D she said, wrapping her arms around herself. \u201CIt just feels\r\nwrongto me. I hate it. I\u2019m glad he got rid of it. Makes him a better man.\u201D\r\nNomon, the middle moon, began to rise. Bright and pale blue, bathing the horizon in light. Somewhere, out across the Plains, was the Parshendi Shardbearer that Kaladin had fought. He\u2019d stabbed the man in the leg from behind. The watching Parshendi had not interfered with the duel and had avoided attacking Kaladin\u2019s wounded bridgemen, but Kaladin had attacked one of their champions from the most cowardly position possible, interfering with a fight.\r\nHe was bothered by what he\u2019d done, and that frustrated him. A warrior couldn\u2019t worry about who he attacked or how. Survival was the only rule of the battlefield.\r\nWell, survival and loyalty. And he sometimes let wounded enemies live if they weren\u2019t a threat. And he saved young soldiers who needed protection. And\u2026\r\nAnd he\u2019d never been good at doing what a warrior should.\r\nToday, he\u2019d saved a highprince\u2014another lighteyes\u2014and along with him thousands of soldiers. Saved them by killing Parshendi.\r\n\u201CCan you kill to protect?\u201D Kaladin asked out loud. \u201CIs that a self-contradiction?\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2026 I don\u2019t know.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou acted strangely in the battle,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CSwirling around me. After that, you left. I didn\u2019t see much of you.\u201D\r\n\u201CThe killing,\u201D she said softly. \u201CIt hurt me. I had to go.\u201D\r\n\u201CYet you\u2019re the one who prompted me to go and save Dalinar. You wanted me to return and kill.\u201D\r\n\u201CI know.\u201D\r\n\u201CTeft said that the Radiants held to a standard,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CHe said that by their rules, you shouldn\u2019t do terrible things to accomplish great ones. Yet what did I do today? Slaughter Parshendi in order to save Alethi. What of that? They aren\u2019t innocent, but neither are we. Not by a faint breeze or a stormwind.\u201D\r\nSyl didn\u2019t reply.\r\n\u201CIf I hadn\u2019t gone to save Dalinar\u2019s men,\u201D Kaladin said, \u201CI would have allowed Sadeas to commit a terrible betrayal. I\u2019d have let men die who I could have saved. I\u2019d have been sick and disgusted with myself. I also lost three good men, bridgemen who were mere breaths away from freedom. Are the lives of the others worth that?\u201D\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t have the answers, Kaladin.\u201D\r\n\u201CDoes anyone?\u201D\r\nFootsteps came from behind. Syl turned. \u201CIt\u2019s him.\u201D\r\nThe moon had just risen. Dalinar Kholin, it appeared, was a punctual man.\r\nHe stepped up beside Kaladin. He carried a bundle under his arm, and he had a military air about him, even without his Shardplate on. In fact, he was more impressive without it. His muscular build indicated that he did not rely on his Plate to give him strength, and the neatly pressed uniform indicated a man who understood that others were inspired when their leader looked the part.\r\nOthers have looked just as noble,Kaladin thought. But would any man trade a\r\nShardbladejust to keep up appearances? And if they would, at what point did the appearance become reality?\r\n\u201CI\u2019m sorry to make you meet me so late,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CI know it has been a long day.\u201D\r\n\u201CI doubt I could have slept anyway.\u201D\r\nDalinar grunted softly, as if he understood. \u201CYour men are seen to?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CQuite well, actually. Thank you.\u201D Kaladin had been given empty barracks for the bridgemen and they had received medical attention from Dalinar\u2019s best surgeons\u2014they\u2019d gotten it\r\nbeforethe wounded lighteyed officers had. The other bridgemen, the ones who weren\u2019t from Bridge Four, had accepted Kaladin immediately, without any deliberation on the matter, as their leader.\r\nDalinar nodded. \u201CHow many, do you suspect, will take my offer of a purse and freedom?\u201D\r\n\u201CA fair number of the men from other crews will. But I\u2019ll wager an even larger number won\u2019t. Bridgemen don\u2019t think of escape or freedom. They wouldn\u2019t know what to do with themselves. As for my own crew\u2026 Well, I have a feeling that they\u2019ll insist on doing whatever I do. If I stay, they\u2019ll stay. If I go, they\u2019ll go.\u201D\r\nDalinar nodded. \u201CAnd what will you do?\u201D\r\n\u201CI haven\u2019t decided yet.\u201D\r\n\u201CI spoke to my officers.\u201D Dalinar grimaced. \u201CThe ones who survived. They said that you gave orders to them, took charge like a lighteyes. My son still feels bitter about the way your\u2026 conversation with him went.\u201D\r\n\u201CEven a fool could see he wasn\u2019t going to be able to get to you. As for the officers, most were in shock or run ragged. I merely nudged them.\u201D\r\n\u201CI owe you my life twice over,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CAnd that of my son and my men.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou paid that debt.\u201D\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CBut I\u2019ve done what I can.\u201D He eyed Kaladin, as if sizing him up, judging him. \u201CWhy did your bridge crew come for us? Why, really?\u201D\r\n\u201CWhy did you give up your Shardblade?\u201D\r\nDalinar held his eyes, then nodded. \u201CFair enough. I have an offer for you. The king and I are about to do something very, very dangerous. Something that will upset all the warcamps.\u201D\r\n\u201CCongratulations.\u201D\r\nDalinar smiled faintly. \u201CMy honor guard has nearly been wiped out, and the men I do have are needed to augment the King\u2019s Guard. My trust is stretched thin these days. I need someone to protect me and my family. I want you and your men for that job.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou want a bunch of bridgemen as bodyguards?\u201D\r\n\u201CThe elite ones as bodyguards,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CThose in your crew, the ones you trained. I want the rest as soldiers for my army. I have heard how well your men fought. You trained them without Sadeas\u2019s knowing, all while running bridges. I\u2019m curious to see what you could do with the right resources.\u201D Dalinar turned away, glancing northward. Toward Sadeas\u2019s camp. \u201CMy army is depleted. I\u2019m going to need every man I can get, but everyone I recruit is going to be suspect. Sadeas will try to send spies into our camp. And traitors. And assassins. Elhokar thinks we won\u2019t last a week.\u201D\r\n\u201CStormfather,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CWhat are you planning?\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m going to take away their games, fully expecting them to react like children losing their favored toy.\u201D\r\n\u201CThese children have armies and Shardblades.\u201D\r\n\u201CUnfortunately.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd\r\nthisis what you want me to protect you from?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes.\u201D\r\nNo quibbling. Straightforward. There was much to respect about that.\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll augment Bridge Four to become the honor guard,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CAnd train the rest as a spearman company. Those in the honor guard get paid like it.\u201D Generally, a lighteyes\u2019s personal guard got triple a standard spearman\u2019s wage.\r\n\u201COf course.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd I want space to train,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CFull right of requisition from the quartermasters. I get to set my men\u2019s schedule, and we appoint our own sergeants and squadleaders. We don\u2019t answer to any lighteyes but yourself, your sons, and the king.\u201D\r\nDalinar raised an eyebrow. \u201CThat last one is a little\u2026 irregular.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou want me to guard you and your family?\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CAgainst the other highprinces and their assassins, who might infiltrate your army and your officers? Well, I can\u2019t be in a position where any lighteyes in the camp can order me around, now can I?\u201D\r\n\u201CYou have a point,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CYou realize, however, that in doing this I would essentially be giving you the same authority as a lighteyes of fourth dahn. You\u2019d be in charge of a thousand former bridgemen. A full battalion.\u201D\r\n\u201CYes.\u201D\r\nDalinar thought for a moment. \u201CVery well. Consider yourself appointed to the rank of captain\u2014that\u2019s as high as I dare appoint a darkeyes. If I named you battalionlord, it would cause a whole mess of problems. I\u2019ll let it be known, however, that you\u2019re outside the chain of command. You don\u2019t order around lighteyes of lesser rank than you, and lighteyes of higher rank have no authority over you.\u201D\r\n\u201CAll right,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CBut these soldiers I train, I want them assigned to patrolling, not plateau runs. I hear you\u2019ve had several full battalions hunting bandits, keeping the peace in the Outer Market, that sort of thing. That\u2019s where my men go for one year, at least.\u201D\r\n\u201CEasy enough,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CYou want time to train them before throwing them into battle, I assume.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat, and I killed a lot of Parshendi today. I found myself regretting their deaths. They showed me more honor than most members of my own army have. I didn\u2019t like the feeling, and I want some time to think about it. The bodyguards I train for you, we\u2019ll go out onto the field, but our primary purpose will be protecting you, not killing Parshendi.\u201D\r\nDalinar looked bemused. \u201CAll right. Though you shouldn\u2019t have to worry. I don\u2019t plan to be on the front lines much in the future. My role is changing. Regardless, we have a deal.\u201D\r\nKaladin held out a hand. \u201CThis is contingent on my men agreeing.\u201D\r\n\u201CI thought you said that they\u2019d do what you did.\u201D\r\n\u201CProbably,\u201D Kaladin said. \u201CI command them, but I don\u2019t own them.\u201D\r\nDalinar reached out, taking his hand, shaking it by the light of the rising sapphire moon. Then he took the bundle out from underneath his arm. \u201CHere.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat is this?\u201D Kaladin said, taking the bundle.\r\n\u201CMy cloak. The one I wore to battle today, washed and patched.\u201D\r\nKaladin unfurled it. It was of a deep blue, with the glyphpair of\r\nkhokhand\r\nlinilsewn into the back in white embroidery.\r\n\u201CEach man who wears my colors,\u201D Dalinar said, \u201Cis of my family, in a way. The cloak is a simple gift, but it is one of the few things I can offer that has any meaning. Accept it with my gratitude, Kaladin Stormblessed.\u201D\r\nKaladin slowly refolded the cloak. \u201CWhere did you hear that name?\u201D\r\n\u201CYour men,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CThey think very highly of you. And that makes\r\nmethink very highly of you. I need men like you, like all of you.\u201D He narrowed his eyes, looking thoughtful. \u201CThe whole kingdom needs you. Perhaps all of Roshar. The True Desolation comes\u2026.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat was that last part?\u201D\r\n\u201CNothing,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CPlease, go get some rest, Captain. I hope to hear good news from you soon.\u201D\r\nKaladin nodded and withdrew, passing the two men who acted as Dalinar\u2019s guard for the night. The hike back to his new barracks was a short one. Dalinar had given him one building for each of the bridge crews. Over a thousand men. What was he going to do with so many? He\u2019d never commanded a group larger than twenty-five before.\r\nBridge Four\u2019s barrack was empty. Kaladin hesitated outside the doorway, looking in. The barrack was furnished with a bunk and locking chest for each man. It seemed a palace.\r\nHe smelled smoke. Frowning, he rounded the barrack to find the men sitting around a firepit in the back, relaxing on stumps or stones, waiting as Rock cooked them a pot of stew. They were listening to Teft, who sat with his arm bandaged, speaking quietly. Shen was there; the quiet parshman sat at the very edge of the group. They\u2019d recovered him, along with their wounded, from Sadeas\u2019s camp.\r\nTeft cut off as soon as he saw Kaladin, and the men turned, most of them bearing bandages of some sort.\r\nDalinar wantsthese\r\nfor his bodyguards?Kaladin thought. They were a ragged bunch indeed.\r\nAs it happened, however, he seconded Dalinar\u2019s choice. If he were going to put his life in someone\u2019s hands, he\u2019d choose this group.\r\n\u201CWhat are you doing?\u201D Kaladin asked sternly. \u201CYou should all be resting.\u201D\r\nThe bridgemen glanced at each other.\r\n\u201CIt just\u2026\u201D Moash said. \u201CIt didn\u2019t feel right to go to sleep until we\u2019d had a chance to\u2026 well, do this.\u201D\r\n\u201CHard to sleep on a day like this, gancho,\u201D Lopen added.\r\n\u201CSpeak for yourself,\u201D Skar said, yawning, wounded leg resting up on a stump. \u201CBut the stew is worth staying up for. Even if he does put rocks in it.\u201D\r\n\u201CI do not!\u201D Rock snapped. \u201CAirsick lowlanders.\u201D\r\nThey\u2019d left a place for Kaladin. He sat down, using Dalinar\u2019s cloak as a cushion for his back and head. He gratefully took a bowl of stew that Drehy handed him.\r\n\u201CWe\u2019ve been talking about what the men saw today,\u201D Teft said. \u201CThe things you did.\u201D\r\nKaladin hesitated, spoon to his mouth. He\u2019d nearly forgotten\u2014or maybe he\u2019d intentionally forgotten\u2014that he\u2019d shown his men what he could do with Stormlight. Hopefully Dalinar\u2019s soldiers hadn\u2019t seen. His Stormlight had been faint by then, the day bright.\r\n\u201CI see,\u201D Kaladin said, his appetite fleeing. Did they see him as different? Frightening? Something to be ostracized, as his father had been back in Hearthstone? Worse yet, something to be worshipped? He looked into their wide eyes and braced himself.\r\n\u201CIt was\r\namazing!\u201D Drehy said, leaning forward.\r\n\u201CYou\u2019re one of the Radiants,\u201D Skar said, pointing. \u201CI believe it, even if Teft says you aren\u2019t.\u201D\r\n\u201CHe isn\u2019t\r\nyet,\u201D Teft snapped. \u201CDon\u2019t you listen?\u201D\r\n\u201CCan you teach me to do what you did?\u201D Moash cut in.\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll learn too, gancho,\u201D Lopen said. \u201CYou know, if you\u2019re teaching and all.\u201D\r\nKaladin blinked, overwhelmed, as the others chimed in.\r\n\u201CWhat can you do?\u201D\r\n\u201CHow does it feel?\u201D\r\n\u201CCan you fly?\u2019\r\nHe held up a hand, stanching the questions. \u201CAren\u2019t you alarmed by what you saw?\u201D\r\nSeveral of the men shrugged.\r\n\u201CIt kept you alive, gancho,\u201D Lopen said. \u201CThe only thing I\u2019d be alarmed about is how irresistible the women would find it. \u2018Lopen,\u2019 they\u2019d say, \u2018you only have one arm, but I see that you can glow. I think that you should kiss me now.\u2019\u201D\r\n\u201CBut it\u2019s strange and frightening,\u201D Kaladin protested. \u201CThis is what the Radiants did! Everyone knows they were traitors.\u201D\r\n\u201CYeah,\u201D Moash said, snorting. \u201CJust like everyone knows that the light-eyes are chosen by the Almighty to rule, and how they\u2019re always noble and just.\u201D\r\n\u201CWe\u2019re Bridge Four,\u201D Skar added. \u201CWe\u2019ve been around. We\u2019ve lived in the crem and been used as bait. If it helps you survive, it\u2019s good. That\u2019s all that needs to be said about it.\u201D\r\n\u201CSo can you teach it?\u201D Moash asked. \u201CCan you show us how to do what you do?\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2026 I don\u2019t know if it\r\ncanbe taught,\u201D Kaladin said, glancing at Syl, who bore a curious expression as she sat on a nearby rock. \u201CI\u2019m not certain what\r\nitis.\u201D\r\nThey looked crestfallen.\r\n\u201CBut,\u201D Kaladin added, \u201Cthat doesn\u2019t mean that we shouldn\u2019t try.\u201D\r\nMoash smiled.\r\n\u201CCan you do it?\u201D Drehy asked, fishing out a sphere, a small glowing diamond chip. \u201CRight now? I want to see it when I\u2019m expecting it.\u201D\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s not a feastday sport, Drehy,\u201D Kaladin said.\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t you think we deserve it?\u201D Sigzil leaned forward on his stone.\r\nKaladin paused. Then, hesitantly, he reached out a finger and touched the sphere. He inhaled sharply; drawing in the Light was becoming more and more natural. The sphere faded. Stormlight began to trickle from Kaladin\u2019s skin, and he breathed normally to make it leak faster, making it more visible. Rock pulled out a ragged old blanket\u2014used for kindling\u2014 and tossed it over the fire, disturbing the flamespren and making a few moments of darkness before the flames chewed through.\r\nIn that darkness, Kaladin glowed, pure white Light rising from his skin.\r\n\u201CStorms\u2026\u201D Drehy breathed.\r\n\u201CSo, what\r\ncanyou do with it?\u201D Skar asked, eager. \u201CYou didn\u2019t answer.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m not entirely certain what I can do,\u201D Kaladin said, holding his hand up in front of him. It faded in a moment, and the fire burned through the blanket, lighting them all again. \u201CI\u2019ve only known about it for sure for a few weeks. I can draw arrows toward me and can make rocks stick together. The Light makes me stronger and faster, and it heals my wounds.\u201D\r\n\u201CHow\r\nmuchstronger does it make you?\u201D Sigzil said. \u201CHow much weight can the rocks bear after you stick them together, and how long do they remain bonded? How much faster do you get? Twice as fast? A quarter again as fast? How far away can an arrow be when you draw it toward you, and can you draw other things as well?\u201D\r\nKaladin blinked. \u201CI\u2026 I don\u2019t know.\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, it seems pretty important to know that kind of stuff,\u201D Skar said, rubbing his chin.\r\n\u201CWe can do tests,\u201D Rock folded his arms, smiling. \u201CIs good idea.\u201D\r\n\u201CMaybe it will help us figure out how we can do it too,\u201D Moash noted.\r\n\u201CIs not thing to learn.\u201D Rock shook his head. \u201CIs of the\r\nholetental. For him only.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou don\u2019t know that for certain,\u201D Teft said.\r\n\u201CYou don\u2019t know for certain I don\u2019t know for certain.\u201D Rock wagged a spoon at him. \u201CEat your stew.\u201D\r\nKaladin held up his hands. \u201CYou can\u2019t tell anyone about this, men. They\u2019ll be frightened of me, maybe think I\u2019m related to the Voidbringers or the Radiants. I need your oaths on this.\u201D\r\nHe looked at them, and they nodded, one by one.\r\n\u201CBut we want to help,\u201D Skar said. \u201CEven if we can\u2019t learn it. This thing is part of you, and you\u2019re one of us. Bridge Four. Right?\u201D\r\nKaladin looked at their eager faces and couldn\u2019t stop himself from nodding. \u201CYes. Yes, you can help.\u201D\r\n\u201CExcellent,\u201D Sigzil said. \u201CI\u2019ll prepare a list of tests to gauge speed, accuracy, and the strength of these bonds you can create. We\u2019ll have to find a way to determine if there\u2019s anything else you can do.\u201D\r\n\u201CThrow him off cliff,\u201D Rock said.\r\n\u201CWhat good will that do?\u201D Peet asked.\r\nRock shrugged. \u201CIf he has other abilities, this thing will make them come out, eh? Nothing like falling from cliff to make a man out of a boy!\u201D\r\nKaladin regarded him with a sour expression, and Rock laughed. \u201CIt will be small cliff.\u201D He held up his thumb and forefinger to indicate a tiny amount. \u201CI like you too much for large one.\u201D\r\n\u201CI think you\u2019re joking,\u201D Kaladin said, taking a bite of his stew. \u201CBut just to be safe, I\u2019m sticking you to the ceiling tonight to keep you from trying any experiments while I\u2019m asleep.\u201D\r\nThe bridgemen chuckled.\r\n\u201CJust don\u2019t glow too brightly while we\u2019re trying to sleep, eh, gancho?\u201D Lopen said.\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll do my best.\u201D He took another spoonful of stew. It tasted better than usual. Had Rock changed the recipe?\r\nOr was it something else? As he settled back to eat, the other bridgemen began chatting, speaking of home and their pasts, things that had once been taboo. Several of the men from other crews\u2014wounded whom Kaladin had helped, even just a few lonely souls who were still awake\u2014 wandered over. The men of Bridge Four welcomed them, handing over stew and making room.\r\nEveryone looked as exhausted as Kaladin felt, but nobody spoke of turning in. He could see why, now. Being together, eating Rock\u2019s stew, listening to the quiet chatter while the fire crackled and popped, sending dancing flakes of yellow light into the air\u2026\r\nThis was more relaxing than sleep could be. Kaladin smiled, leaning back, looking upward toward the dark sky and the large sapphire moon. Then he closed his eyes, listening.\r\nThree more men were dead. Malop, Earless Jaks, and Narm. Kaladin had failed them. But he and Bridge Four had protected hundreds of others. Hundreds who would never have to run a bridge again, would never have to face Parshendi arrows, would never have to fight again if they didn\u2019t want to. More personally, twenty-seven of his friends lived. Partially because of what he\u2019d done, partially because of their own heroism.\r\nTwenty-seven men lived. He\u2019d finally managed to save someone.\r\nFor now, that was enough."

      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\nShallan rubbed her eyes. She\u2019d read through Jasnah\u2019s notes\u2014at least the most important ones. Those alone had made a large stack. She still sat in the alcove, though they\u2019d sent a parshman to get her a blanket to wrap around herself, covering up the hospital robe.\r\nHer eyes burned from the night spent crying, then reading. She was exhausted. And yet she also felt alive.\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s true,\u201D she said. \u201CYou\u2019re right. The Voidbringers are the parshmen. I can see no other conclusion.\u201D\r\nJasnah smiled, looking oddly pleased with herself, considering that she\u2019d only convinced one person.\r\n\u201CSo what next?\u201D Shallan asked.\r\n\u201CThat has to do with your previous studies.\u201D\r\n\u201CMy studies? You mean your father\u2019s death?\u201D\r\n\u201CIndeed.\u201D\r\n\u201CThe Parshendi attacked him,\u201D Shallan said. \u201CKilled him suddenly, without warning.\u201D She focused on the other woman. \u201CThat\u2019s what made you begin studying all of this, isn\u2019t it?\u201D\r\nJasnah nodded. \u201CThose wild parshmen\u2014the Parshendi of the Shattered Plains\u2014are the key.\u201D She leaned forward. \u201CShallan. The disaster awaiting us is all too real, all too terrible. I don\u2019t need mystical warnings or theological sermons to frighten me. I\u2019m downright terrified in my own right.\u201D\r\n\u201CBut we have the parshmen tamed.\u201D\r\n\u201CDo we? Shallan, think of what they do, how they\u2019re regarded, how often they\u2019re used.\u201D\r\nShallan hesitated. The parshmen were pervasive.\r\n\u201CThey serve our food,\u201D Jasnah continued. \u201CThey work our storehouses. They tend our\r\nchildren. There isn\u2019t a village in Roshar that doesn\u2019t have some parshmen. We ignore them; we just expect them to be there, doing as they do. Working without complaint.\r\n\u201CYet one group turned suddenly from peaceful friends to slaughtering warriors. Something set them off. Just as it did hundreds of years ago, during the days known as the Heraldic Epochs. There would be a period of peace, followed by an invasion of parshmen who\u2014for reasons nobody understood\u2014had suddenly gone mad with anger and rage.\r\nThiswas what was behind mankind\u2019s fight to keep from being \u2018banished to Damnation.\u2019 This was what nearly ended our civilization. This was the terrible, repeated cataclysm that was so frightening men began to speak of them as Desolations.\r\n\u201CWe\u2019ve nurtured the parshmen. We\u2019ve integrated them into every part of our society. We depend on them, never realizing that we\u2019ve harnessed a highstorm waiting to explode. The accounts from the Shattered Plains speak of these Parshendi\u2019s ability to communicate among themselves, allowing them to sing their songs in unison when far apart. Their minds are connected, like spanreeds. Do you realize what that means?\u201D\r\nShallan nodded. What would happen if every parshman on Roshar suddenly turned against his masters? Seeking freedom, or worse\u2014vengeance? \u201CWe\u2019d be devastated. Civilization as we know it could collapse. We have to\r\ndosomething!\u201D\r\n\u201CWe are,\u201D Jasnah said. \u201CWe\u2019re gathering facts, making certain we know what we think we know.\u201D\r\n\u201CAnd how many facts do we need?\u201D\r\n\u201CMore. Many more.\u201D Jasnah glanced at the books. \u201CThere are some things about the histories I don\u2019t yet understand. Tales of creatures fighting alongside the parshmen, beasts of stone that might be some kind of greatshell, and other oddities that I think may have truth to them. But we\u2019ve exhausted what Kharbranth can offer. Are you still certain you want to delve into this? It is a heavy burden we will bear. You won\u2019t be returning to your estates for some time.\u201D\r\nShallan bit her lip, thinking of her brothers. \u201CYou\u2019d let me go now, after what I know?\u201D\r\n\u201CI won\u2019t have you serving me while thinking of ways to escape.\u201D Jasnah sounded exhausted.\r\n\u201CI can\u2019t just abandon my brothers.\u201D Shallan\u2019s insides twisted again. \u201CBut this is bigger than them. Damnation\u2014it\u2019s bigger than\r\nmeor\r\nyouor any of us. I have to help, Jasnah. I can\u2019t walk out on this. I\u2019ll find some other way to help my family.\u201D\r\n\u201CGood. Then go pack our things. We\u2019re leaving tomorrow on that ship I chartered for you.\u201D\r\n\u201CWe\u2019re going to Jah Keved?\u201D\r\n\u201CNo. We need to get to the center of it all.\u201D She looked at Shallan. \u201CWe\u2019re going to the Shattered Plains. We need to find out if the Parshendi were ever ordinary parshmen, and if so, what set them off. Perhaps I am wrong about this, but if I am right, then the Parshendi could hold the key to turning ordinary parshmen into soldiers.\u201D Then, grimly, she continued. \u201CAnd we need to do it before someone else does, then uses it against us.\u201D\r\n\u201CSomeone else?\u201D Shallan asked, feeling a sharp stab of panic. \u201CThere are others looking for this?\u201D\r\n\u201COf course there are. Who do you think went to so much trouble trying to have me assassinated?\u201D She reached into a stack of papers on her desk. \u201CI don\u2019t know much about them. For all I know, there are many groups searching for these secrets. I know of one for certain, however. They call themselves the Ghostbloods.\u201D She pulled out a sheet. \u201CYour friend Kabsal was one. We found their symbol tattooed on the inside of his arm.\u201D\r\nShe set the sheet down. On it was a symbol of three diamonds in a pattern, overlapping one another.\r\nIt was the same symbol that Nan Balat had shown her weeks ago. The symbol worn by Luesh, her father\u2019s steward, the man who had known how to use the Soulcaster. The symbol worn by the men who had come, pressuring her family to return it. The men who had been financing Shallan\u2019s father in his bid to become highprince.\r\n\u201CAlmighty above,\u201D Shallan whispered. She looked up. \u201CJasnah, I think\u2026 I think my\r\nfathermight have been a member of this group.\u201D"

      "ChapterName": "75: IN THE TOP ROOM",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\nThe highstorm winds began to blow against Dalinar\u2019s complex, powerful enough to make rocks groan. Navani huddled close to Dalinar, holding to him. She smelled wonderful. It felt\u2026 humbling to know how terrified she\u2019d been for him.\r\nHer joy at having him back was enough to dampen, for now, her fury at him for how he\u2019d treated Elhokar. She would come around. It had needed to be done.\r\nAs the highstorm hit in force, Dalinar felt the vision coming on. He closed his eyes, letting it take him. He had a decision to make, a responsibility. What to do? These visions had lied to him, or had at least misled him. It seemed that he couldn\u2019t trust them, at least not as explicitly as he once had.\r\nHe took a deep breath, opened his eyes, and found himself in a place of smoke.\r\nHe turned about, wary. The sky was dark and he stood on a field of dull, bone-white rock, jagged and rough, extending in all directions. Off into eternity. Amorphous shapes made of curling grey smoke rose from the ground. Like smoke rings, only in other shapes. Here a chair. There a rockbud, with vines extended, curling to the sides and vanishing. Beside him appeared the figure of a man in uniform, silent and vaporous, rising lethargically toward the sky, mouth open. The shapes melted and distorted as they climbed higher, though they seemed to hold their forms longer than they should. It was unnerving, standing on the eternal plain, pure darkness above, smoke figures rising all around.\r\nIt wasn\u2019t like any vision he\u2019d seen before. It was\u2026\r\nNo, wait.He frowned, stepping back as the figure of a tree burst from the ground close to him.\r\nI have seen this place before. In the first of my visions, so many months ago.It was fuzzy in his mind. He\u2019d been disoriented, the vision vague, as if his mind hadn\u2019t learned to accept what it was seeing. In fact, the only thing he remembered distinctly was\u2014\r\n\u201CYou must unite them,\u201D a strong voice boomed.\r\n\u2014was the voice. Speaking to him from all around, causing the smoke figures to fuzz and distort.\r\n\u201CWhy did you lie to me?\u201D Dalinar demanded of the open darkness. \u201CI did what you said, and I was betrayed!\u201D\r\n\u201CUnite them. The sun approaches the horizon. The Everstorm comes. The True Desolation. The Night of Sorrows.\u201D\r\n\u201CI need answers!\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CI don\u2019t trust you any longer. If you want me to listen to you, you\u2019ll need to\u2014\u201D\r\nThe vision changed. He spun about, finding that he was still on an open plain of rock, but the normal sun was in the sky. The stone field looked like an ordinary one on Roshar.\r\nIt was very odd for one of the visions to set him in a place without others to talk to and interact with. Though, for once, he wore his own clothing. The sharp blue Kholin uniform.\r\nHad this happened before, the other time he\u2019d been in that place of smoke? Yes\u2026 it had. This was the first time he\u2019d been taken to a place where he\u2019d been before. Why?\r\nHe carefully scanned the scenery. Since the voice didn\u2019t speak to him again, he began to walk, passing cracked boulders and broken bits of shale, pebbles and rocks. There were no plants, not even rockbuds. Just an empty landscape filled with broken stones.\r\nEventually, he spotted a ridge. Getting to high ground felt like a good idea, though the hike seemed to take hours. The vision did not end. Time was often odd in these visions. He continued to hike up the side of the rock formation, wishing he had his Shardplate to strengthen him. Finally at the top, he walked over to the edge to look down below.\r\nAnd there he saw Kholinar, his home, the capital city of Alethkar.\r\nIt had been destroyed.\r\nThe beautiful buildings had been shattered. The windblades were cast down. There were no bodies, just broken stone. This wasn\u2019t like the vision he had seen before, with Nohadon. That wasn\u2019t the Kholinar of the distant past; he could see the rubble of his own palace. But there was no rock formation like the one he stood on near Kholinar in the real world. Always before, these visions had shown him the past. Was this now a vision of the future?\r\n\u201CI cannot fight him any longer,\u201D the voice said.\r\nDalinar jumped, glancing to the side. A man stood there. He had dark skin and pure white hair. Tall, thick of chest but not massive, he wore exotic clothing of a strange cut: loose, billowing trousers and a coat that came down only to his waist. Both seemed made of gold.\r\nYes\u2026 this very thing had happened before, in his very first vision. Dalinar could remember it now. \u201CWho are you?\u201D Dalinar demanded. \u201CWhy are you showing me these visions?\u201D\r\n\u201CYou can see it there,\u201D the figure said, pointing. \u201CIf you look closely. It begins in the distance.\u201D\r\nDalinar glanced in that direction, annoyed. He couldn\u2019t make out anything specific. \u201CStorm it,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CWon\u2019t you answer my questions for once? What is the good of all of this if you just speak in riddles?\u201D\r\nThe man didn\u2019t answer. He just kept pointing. And\u2026 yes, something\r\nwashappening. There was a shadow in the air, approaching. A wall of darkness. Like a highstorm, only\r\nwrong.\r\n\u201CAt least tell me this,\u201D Dalinar said. \u201CWhat time are we seeing? Is this the past, the future, or something else entirely?\u201D\r\nThe figure didn\u2019t answer immediately. Then he said, \u201CYou\u2019re probably wondering if this is a vision of the future.\u201D\r\nDalinar started. \u201CI just\u2026 I just asked\u2026\u201D\r\nThis was familiar. Too familiar.\r\nHe said that exact thing last time,Dalinar realized, feeling a chill.\r\nThis all happened. I\u2019m seeing the same vision again.\r\nThe figure squinted at the horizon. \u201CI cannot see the future completely. Cultivation, she is better at it than I. It\u2019s as if the future is a shattering window. The further you look, the more pieces that window breaks into. The near future can be anticipated, but the distant future\u2026 I can only guess.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou can\u2019t hear me, can you?\u201D Dalinar asked, feeling a horror as he finally began to understand. \u201CYou never could.\u201D\r\nBlood of my fathers\u2026 he\u2019s not ignoring me. He can\u2019t see me! He doesn\u2019t speak in riddles. It just seems that way because I took his responses as cryptic answers to my questions.\r\nHe didn\u2019t tell me to trust Sadeas. I\u2026 I just assumed\u2026\r\nEverything seemed to shake around Dalinar. His preconceptions, what he\u2019d thought he\u2019d known. The ground itself.\r\n\u201CThat is what could happen,\u201D the figure said, nodding into the distance. \u201CIt\u2019s what I fear will happen. It\u2019s what he wants. The True Desolation.\u201D\r\nNo, that wall in the air wasn\u2019t a highstorm. It wasn\u2019t rain making that enormous shadow, but blowing dust. He remembered this vision in full, now. It had ended here, with him confused, staring out at that oncoming wall of dust. This time, however, the vision continued.\r\nThe figure turned to him. \u201CI am sorry to do this to you. By now I hope that what you\u2019ve seen has given you a foundation to understand. But I can\u2019t know for certain. I don\u2019t know who you are, or how you have found your way here.\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2026\u201D What to say? Did it matter?\r\n\u201CMost of what I show you are scenes I have seen directly,\u201D the figure said. \u201CBut some, such as this one, are born out of my fears. If I fear it, then you should too.\u201D\r\nThe land was trembling. The wall of dust was being caused by something. Something approaching.\r\nThe ground was falling away.\r\nDalinar gasped. The very rocks ahead were shattering, breaking apart, becoming dust. He backed away as everything began to shake, a massive earthquake accompanied by a terrible roar of dying rocks. He fell to the ground.\r\nThere was an awful, grinding, terrifying moment of nightmare. The shaking, the destruction, the sounds of the land itself seeming to die.\r\nThen it was past. Dalinar breathed in and out before rising on unsteady legs. He and the figure stood on a solitary pinnacle of rock. A little section that\u2014for some reason\u2014had been protected. It was like a stone pillar a few paces wide, rising high into the air.\r\nAround it, the land was\r\ngone. Kholinar was gone. It had all fallen away into unplumbed darkness below. He felt vertigo, standing on the tiny bit of rock that\u2014impossibly\u2014remained.\r\n\u201CWhat is this?\u201D Dalinar demanded, though he knew that the being couldn\u2019t hear him.\r\nThe figure looked about, sorrowful. \u201CI can\u2019t leave much. Just these few images, given to you. Whoever you are.\u201D\r\n\u201CThese visions\u2026 they\u2019re like a journal, aren\u2019t they? A history you wrote, a book you left behind, except I don\u2019t read it, I see it.\u201D\r\nThe figure looked into the sky. \u201CI don\u2019t even know if anyone will ever see this. I am gone, you see.\u201D\r\nDalinar didn\u2019t respond. He looked over the sheer pinnacle, down at a void, horrified.\r\n\u201CThis isn\u2019t just about you either,\u201D the figure said, raising his hand into the air. A light winked out in the sky, one that Dalinar hadn\u2019t realized was there. Then another winked out as well. The sun seemed to be growing dimmer.\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s about all of them,\u201D the figure said. \u201CI should have realized he\u2019d come for me.\u201D\r\n\u201CWho are you?\u201D Dalinar asked, voicing the words to himself.\r\nThe figure still stared into the sky. \u201CI leave this, because there must be something. A hope to discover. A chance that someone will find what to do. Do you wish to fight him?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D Dalinar found himself saying, despite knowing that it didn\u2019t matter. \u201CI don\u2019t know who he is, but if he wants to do\r\nthis, then I will fight him.\u201D\r\n\u201CSomeone must lead them.\u201D\r\n\u201CI will do it,\u201D Dalinar said. The words just came out.\r\n\u201CSomeone must unite them.\u201D\r\n\u201CI will do it.\u201D\r\n\u201CSomeone must protect them.\u201D\r\n\u201CI will do it!\u201D\r\nThe figure was silent for a moment. Then he spoke in a clear, crisp voice. \u201CLife before death. Strength before weakness. Journey before destination. Speak again the ancient oaths and return to men the Shards they once bore.\u201D He turned to Dalinar, meeting his eyes. \u201CThe Knights Radiant must stand again.\u201D\r\n\u201CI cannot comprehend how that can be done,\u201D Dalinar said softly. \u201CBut I will try.\u201D\r\n\u201CMen must face them together,\u201D the figure said, stepping up to Dalinar, placing a hand on his shoulder. \u201CYou cannot squabble as in times past. He\u2019s realized that you, given time, will become your own enemies. That he doesn\u2019t\r\nneedto fight you. Not if he can make you forget, make you turn against one another. Your legends say that you won. But the truth is that we lost. And we are losing.\u201D\r\n\u201CWho are you?\u201D Dalinar asked again, voice softer.\r\n\u201CI wish I could do more,\u201D repeated the figure in gold. \u201CYou might be able to get him to choose a champion. He is bound by some rules. All of us are. A champion could work well for you, but it is not certain. And\u2026 without the Dawnshards\u2026 Well, I have done what I can. It is a terrible, terrible thing to leave you alone.\u201D\r\n\u201CWho are you?\u201D Dalinar asked again. And yet, he thought he knew.\r\n\u201CI am\u2026\r\nI was\u2026 God. The one you call the Almighty, the creator of mankind.\u201D The figure closed his eyes. \u201CAnd now I am dead. Odium has killed me. I am sorry.\u201D"

      "ChapterName": "Epilogue: Of Most Worth",
      "Chapter": "The Way of Kings\r\n\u201CCan you feel it?\u201D Wit asked of the open night. \u201CSomething just changed. I believe that\u2019s the sound the world makes when it pisses itself.\u201D\r\nThree guards stood just inside the thick wooden city gates of Kholinar. The men regarded Wit with worry.\r\nThe gates were closed, and these men were of the night watch, a somewhat inappropriate title. They didn\u2019t spend time \u201Cwatching\u201D so much as chatting, yawning, gambling, or\u2014in tonight\u2019s case\u2014standing uncomfortably and listening to a crazy man.\r\nThat crazy man happened to have blue eyes, which let him get away with all kinds of trouble. Perhaps Wit should have been bemused by the stock these people put in something as simple as eye color, but he had been many places and seen many methods of rule. This didn\u2019t seem any more ridiculous than most others.\r\nAnd, of course, there was a reason the people did what they did. Well, there was usually a reason. In this case, it just happened to be a good one.\r\n\u201CBrightlord?\u201D one of the guards asked, looking at where Wit sat on his boxes. They\u2019d been piled there and left by a merchant who had tipped the night watchmen to make certain nothing was stolen. To Wit, they simply made a convenient perch. His pack sat beside him, and on his knees he was tuning his enthir, a square, stringed instrument. You played it from above, plucking at strings with it sitting on your lap.\r\n\u201CBrightlord?\u201D the guard repeated. \u201CWhat are you doing up there?\u201D\r\n\u201CWaiting,\u201D Wit said. He looked up, glancing eastward. \u201CWaiting for the storm to arrive.\u201D\r\nThat made the guards more uncomfortable. A highstorm was not predicted this night.\r\nWit began playing the enthir. \u201CLet us have a conversation to pass the time. Tell me. What is it that men value in others?\u201D\r\nThe music played toward an audience of silent buildings, alleys, and worn cobblestones. The guards didn\u2019t respond to him. They didn\u2019t seem to know what to make of a black-clad, lighteyed man who entered the city just before evening fell, then sat on boxes beside the gates playing music.\r\n\u201CWell?\u201D Wit asked, pausing the music. \u201CWhat do you think? If a man or woman were to have a talent, which would be the most revered, best regarded, considered of the most worth?\u201D\r\n\u201CEr\u2026 music?\u201D one of the men finally said.\r\n\u201CYes, a common answer,\u201D Wit said, plucking at a few low notes. \u201CI once asked this question of some very wise scholars. What do men consider the most valuable of talents? One mentioned artistic ability, as you so keenly guessed. Another chose great intellect. The final chose the talent to invent, the ability to design and create great devices.\u201D\r\nHe didn\u2019t play a specific tune on the enthir, just plucks here and there, an occasional scale or fifth. Like chitchat in string form.\r\n\u201CAesthetic genius,\u201D Wit said, \u201Cinvention, acumen, creativity. Noble ideals indeed. Most men would pick one of those, if given the choice, and name them the greatest of talents.\u201D He plucked a string. \u201CWhat beautiful liars we are.\u201D\r\nThe guards glanced at each other; the torches burning in brackets on the wall painted them with orange light.\r\n\u201CYou think I\u2019m a cynic,\u201D Wit said. \u201CYou think I\u2019m going to tell you that men claim to value these ideals, but secretly prefer base talents. The ability to gather coin or to charm women. Well, I\r\nama cynic, but in this case, I actually think those scholars were honest. Their answers speak for the souls of men. In our hearts, we want to believe in\u2014and would choose\u2014 great accomplishment and virtue. That\u2019s why our lies, particularly to ourselves, are so beautiful.\u201D\r\nHe began to play a real song. A simple melody at first, soft, subdued. A song for a silent night when the entire world changed.\r\nOne of the soldiers cleared his throat. \u201CSo what\r\nisthe most valuable talent a man can have?\u201D He sounded genuinely curious.\r\n\u201CI haven\u2019t the faintest idea,\u201D Wit said. \u201CFortunately, that wasn\u2019t the question. I didn\u2019t ask what was most valuable, I asked what\r\nmen value most. The difference between those questions is both tiny and as vast as the world itself all at once.\u201D\r\nHe kept plucking his song. One did not strum an enthir. It just wasn\u2019t done, at least not by people with any sense of propriety.\r\n\u201CIn this,\u201D Wit said, \u201Cas in all things, our actions give us away. If an artist creates a work of powerful beauty\u2014using new and innovative techniques\u2014she will be lauded as a master, and will launch a new movement in aesthetics. Yet what if another, working independently with that exact level of skill, were to make the same accomplishments the very next month? Would she find similar acclaim? No. She\u2019d be called derivative.\r\n\u201CIntellect. If a great thinker develops a new theory of mathematics, science, or philosophy, we will name him wise. We will sit at his feet and learn, and will record his name in history for thousands upon thousands to revere. But what if another man determines the same theory on his own, then delays in publishing his results by a mere week? Will he be remembered for his greatness? No. He will be forgotten.\r\n\u201CInvention. A woman builds a new design of great worth\u2014some fabrial or feat of engineering. She will be known as an innovator. But if someone with the same talent creates the same design a year later\u2014not realizing it has already been crafted\u2014will\r\nshebe rewarded for her creativity? No. She\u2019ll be called a copier and a forger.\u201D\r\nHe plucked at his strings, letting the melody continue, twisting, haunting, yet with a faint edge of mockery. \u201CAnd so,\u201D he said, \u201Cin the end, what must we determine? Is it the\r\nintellectof a genius that we revere? If it were their artistry, the beauty of their mind, would we not laud it regardless of whether we\u2019d seen their product before?\r\n\u201CBut we don\u2019t. Given two works of artistic majesty, otherwise weighted equally, we will give greater acclaim to the one who did it\r\nfirst. It doesn\u2019t matter what you create. It matters what you create\r\nbefore anyone else.\r\n\u201CSo it\u2019s not the beauty itself we admire. It\u2019s not the force of intellect. It\u2019s not invention, aesthetics, or capacity itself. The greatest talent that we think a man can have?\u201D He plucked one final string. \u201CSeems to me that it must be nothing more than novelty.\u201D\r\nThe guards looked confused.\r\nThe gates shook. Something pounded on them from outside.\r\n\u201CThe storm has come,\u201D Wit said, standing up.\r\nThe guards scrambled for spears left leaning beside the wall. They had a guard house, but it was empty; they preferred the night air.\r\nThe gate shook again, as if something enormous were outside. The guards yelled, calling to the men atop the wall. All was chaos and confusion as the gate thumped yet a third time, powerful, shaking, vibrating as if hit with a boulder.\r\nAnd then a bright, silvery blade rammed between the massive doors, slicing upward, cutting the bar that held them closed. A Shardblade.\r\nThe gates swung open. The guards scrambled back. Wit waited on his boxes, enthir held in one hand, pack over his shoulder.\r\nOutside the gates, standing on the dark stone roadway, was a solitary man with dark skin. His hair was long and matted, his clothing nothing more than a ragged, sacklike length of cloth wrapping his waist. He stood with head bowed, wet, ratty hair hanging down over his face and mixing with a beard that had bits of wood and leaves stuck in it.\r\nHis muscles glistened, wet as if he\u2019d just swum a great distance. To his side, he carried a massive Shardblade, point down, sticking about a finger\u2019s width into the stone, his hand on the hilt. The Blade reflected torchlight; it was long, narrow, and straight, shaped like an enormous spike.\r\n\u201CWelcome, lost one,\u201D Wit whispered.\r\n\u201CWho are you!\u201D one of the guards called, nervous, as one of the other two ran to give the alert. A Shardbearer had come to Kholinar.\r\nThe figure ignored the question. He stepped forward, dragging his Shardblade, as if it weighed a great deal. It cut the rock behind him, leaving a tiny groove in the stone. The figure walked unsteadily, and nearly tripped. He steadied himself against the gate door, and a lock of hair moved from the side of his face, exposing his eyes. Dark brown eyes, like a man of the lower class. Those eyes were wild, dazed.\r\nThe man finally noticed the two guards, who stood, terrified, with spears leveled at him. He raised his empty hand toward them. \u201CGo,\u201D he said raggedly, speaking perfect Alethi, no hint of an accent. \u201CRun! Raise the call! Give the warning!\u201D\r\n\u201CWho are you?\u201D one of the guards forced out. \u201CWhat warning? Who attacks?\u201D\r\nThe man paused. He raised a hand to his head, wavering. \u201CWho am I? I\u2026 I am Talenel\u2019Elin, Stonesinew, Herald of the Almighty. The Desolation has come. Oh, God\u2026 it has come. And I have failed.\u201D\r\nHe slumped forward, hitting the rocky ground, Shardblade clattering down behind him. It did not vanish. The guards inched forward. One prodded the man with the butt of his spear.\r\nThe man who had named himself a Herald did not move.\r\n\u201CWhat is it we value?\u201D Wit whispered. \u201CInnovation. Originality. Novelty. But most importantly\u2026 timeliness. I fear you may be too late, my confused, unfortunate friend.\u201D\r\nTHE END OF\r\nBook One ofTHE STORMLIGHT ARCHIVE"
